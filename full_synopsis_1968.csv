At first, their friend and current landlord Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins (Maurice Evans) tries to dissuade them from doing so: the building has a rather unsavory past. It has been occupied by cannibal killers, Satanists and witches, such as the Trench Sisters, Keith Kennedy, Pearl Ames--and the sinister Adrian Marcato, who created a scandal in the late 1890s by claiming to have conjured ""The Living Devil.""Rosemary and Guy ignore him and move in. Guy is an actor with a fledging career. He's done plenty of TV plays and commercials, which have made him good money; but he wants great parts. Rosemary is a gentle soul, originally from Omaha, Nebraska, where she had been raised in a Catholic home and had attended convent school.As it is, Rosemary is estranged from her family, since they don't accept her marriage to Guy, who is not only an actor, but is also of mixed Jewish/Protestant upbringing. So her life in New York is all she has: she is a young housewife dedicated entirely to making a good home for her husband, whom she adores. She has a good circle of friends, but is at core sweetly naïve and lonely.One day in the laundry room, Rosemary makes the acquaintance of Terry Gionnoffrio (Victoria Vetri), a young former drug addict who was ""rescued from the gutter"" by an elderly, eccentric couple, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). The Castavets's apartment had formerly been the front part of theirs, but is now separated by a partition.Her friendship with Terry is short-lived. A few days after Rosemary meets her, Terry plunges to her death from the bay window. She and Guy are walking home when they see the police surrounding Terry's corpse. The Castavets happen to be walking home, too. Presumably distraught, they strike up an acquaintance with the Woodhouses and later invite them to dinner. Rosemary becomes suspicious about their new elderly friends, particularly the way that Roman insists on speaking with Guy in private. Other things trouble her, too, such as when Guy's career gets a jump start when his main rival, Donald Baumgart, suddenly goes blind. Now all he cares about is his new play.But then suddenly, he decides he wants to become a father. Rosemary is thrilled.Evidently having studied her ovulation cycle himself, he announces the ideal ""baby night."" That evening, Minnie drops by to give them some chocolate mousse--or mouse as she calls it. Rosemary complains of a chalky undertaste, but Guy gets angry over her ingratitude. She eats part of it, and then furtively hides the rest in her napkin.Suddenly feeling disoriented after dinner, she passes out and has a bizarre dream. Rosemary is floating on a mattress in the sea, visits a cruise ship with the Kennedy's, has her wedding band removed, is carried through the Sistine Chapel, a brief shot of the linen closet with guy saying ""easy, you got her too high"" then she's back on the cruise ship naked and told by the skipper go below the deck and passes by a burning church and lays down on a mattress. The unsettling dream becomes a nightmare when she finds herself surrounded by naked elderly people, a statue figure of a bearded man staring down at her, and two men tie her to a bed. Then Jackie Kennedy soothes her for not feeling well. Guy approaches her bed, but then something that looks and feels inhuman brutally rapes her. ""This is no dream!"" she cries. ""This is really happening!"" Pope Paul VI, then visiting NYC and having mass at Yankee Stadium, comes to offer her absolution.When she wakes up, Rosemary is sore and scratched. Guy half-heartedly apologizes for having had her while she was out. Rosemary is angry, but ""baby night"" later proves successful. Dr. C.C. Hill (Charles Grodin)--referred to her by her girlfriend Elise Dunstan (Emmaline Henry)--confirms it.Upon hearing the news, the Castevets persuade Rosemary to go to Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy), a prominent obstetrician who delivers all the upper crust babies in the city. Rosemary entrusts herself to him, accepting his odd advice and his recommendation of Minnie's strange ""vitamin drinks."" She develops pain during her first trimester, which causes her to lose weight and look emaciated, alarming Hutch--but not the doctor, Guy, the Castevets or their Saturday night gang of quaint old timers, including Dr. Stan Shand (Phil Leeds) and the obnoxious Laura-Louise McBurney (Patsy Kelly).As her pregnancy progresses, Rosemary feels a mounting sense of dread and angst. What is wrong with her? Why won't anyone acknowledge it? She decides to throw a party for her young friends, a qualification she insists upon. Her girlfriends--including Elise, Joan Jellico (Marianne Gordon) and Tiger Hoanigsen (Wende Wagner)--tell her she looks awful and that her pain is far from normal. She has to see a new doctor. Rosemary tells Guy, and they fight bitterly over it. But at the last minute she relents. The pain has suddenly stopped. And now she can feel the baby kicking.Rosemary's friend Hutch drops by for a visit; Roman and Minnie spot him, and suddenly Guy arrives home unexpectedly, as if they'd phoned him and urged him to rush back to the apartment. Hutch asks a lot of questions of Roman and Guy, and before he leaves the apartment, he realizes he's misplaced one of his gloves. Later, Hutch falls into a mysterious coma and dies. Rosemary receives a book from Hutch's companion, Grace Cardiff (Hanna Landy), which Hutch had intended to give to Rosemary personally. It's called ""All of Them Witches,"" a study on witchcraft through the ages, featuring a chapter on Adrian Marcato (his appearance is familiar from the ""dream"") and his son, Steven. ""The name is an anagram,"" is the final clue Hutch had left for her. Rosemary uses her Scrabble tiles to learn the horrible truth: Roman Castevet is Steven Marcato.Now she suspects Roman, Minnie and all their all-too-helpful friends are Satan worshipers. She visits Dr. Sapirstein and tells him she'll have no more to do with them. It's just as well, Sapirstein informs her: Roman is dying and would like to go away to Europe on a farewell tour. Rosie feels guilty about her suspicions, and when the time comes, bids them a fond farewell.But not all is what it seems. As her due date--June 28, 1966--nears, she learns one strange thing after the other. Could it be that Guy is involved with witches? Witches use babies for their rituals. Has he promised them the baby? She also learns that witches use the belongings of their intended victims to blind or kill them. On a hunch, she contacts Guy's former rival, Donald Baumgart, and gets him to reveal that Guy swapped ties with him just before he went blind.Distraught, Rosemary packs a suitcase and goes to Dr. Sapirstein to tell him what she's learned. But his secretary's off-hand remark reveals something horrible--the good doctor sometimes smells like tannis root, which she has learned is more commonly called Devil's Pepper. Dr. Sapirstein is a witch, too. He must be part of the plot against her. Next, Rosemary persuades Dr. Hill to see her. When she reveals her suspicions to him, he seems to take her seriously, and he gives her a sedative to help her sleep, but she is horrified when she awakens and find that Guy and Dr. Sapirstein have arrived to take her back home. She manages lock them out of the apartment, but before she can call for help, Guy and the others appear in the apartment, having entered by some other means. Rosemary tries to fight them off and she goes into labor. They have to force her down on her bed, while Sapirstein injects her with something to make her sleep.When she wakes, Guy tells her she has had a boy and that he's fine. But later, Sapirstein tells her that the baby is dead. The coven members sit with Rosemary, collecting her breast milk, and she thinks she can hear a baby crying through the walls of the apartment. She knows they have taken the baby, and she thinks they are planning to sacrifice it for one of their rituals.After a few days of pretending to cooperate and take her sedatives, Rosemary arms herself with a sharp butcher knife and finds the partition between her apartment and the apartment of the Castavets. Removing the closet interior, she finds the hidden doorway to the other apartment and goes inside. She looks at an oil painting of a burning church whispering ""you got her too high"", apparently having a flashback of the ""dream"". She discovers the entire coven sitting in the living room around a bassinet, including Minnie and Roman. A photo of Adrian Marcato is up above the mantle. There are other people there, too, that Rosemary does not recognize, people that seem to have come from as far away as Japan. She approaches the bassinet and sees the baby for the first time (not shown to the audience), horrified that the baby has strange eyes. ""He has his father's eyes,"" Roman tells her, and the coven tells her that Satan is the baby's father, not Guy. Guy finally tells her that he made an agreement with the coven to allow them to impregnate Rosemary with the spawn of the Devil in exchange for a successful acting career. Rosemary spits in his face. Now totally beaten, she collapses into a chair and Minnie brings her a cup of tea. Roman speaks more gently to her and encourages her to be the baby's mother and does not need to join their evil coven. Although Rosemary hesitates at first, her maternal instincts win out, and the film ends as she rocks the baby's cradle and sings to him.","

"2","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063442/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","A ship in space, Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston) is at the controls. He's making a log entry about the journey so far. Although nearly six months out from Earth since they took off in 1972; they have traveled 700 years into the future due to their faster than light speed through a wormhole.Taylor takes an injection and returns to a stasis chamber to wait out the rest of the voyage with his three fellow astronauts. As he sleeps the ship continues on before encountering a planet and crashes into a lake. The ship awakens the crew, who immediately realize their situation. One of the four (a young woman) has died in stasis.Suddenly one of the bulkheads collapses and the ship begins to sink. The remaining three crewmen scramble to escape after being unsuccessful in sending a message to Earth. As Taylor leaves the ship he sees the ship's clock showing the year as 3978. They have been in space for over 2,000 years, yet by traveling through a hyperspace wormhole they have aged only about 20 months, with long beards to prove it.The three men, Taylor, Landon (Robert Gunner), Dodge (Jeff Burton) take to a raft and begin paddling along the shoreline looking for a safe place to camp. Taylor surmises that they are some 320 light years from Earth on a planet orbiting a star in the Orion system. Landon calls him out on this information claiming Taylor didn't have enough time to read the tapes before their ship sank.Coming ashore they take stock of their situation, they have food and water for three days and a handgun. Taylor tells the others about the clocks and proof they offer about the theory of relativity. Landon stops to plant an American flag before moving off.They begin their journey in the rocky desert, around them unseen figures move across the cliff tops watching their progress. Slowly the country changes and stray vegetation is seen. Passing an out crop they see wooden crosses planted in the ground resembling a borderline fence. Evidence something intelligent lives on the planet.Passing the crosses they see trees and can hear a waterfall. Realizing they may survive, they take all their clothes off and go for a swim in the lake. Further along on a muddy bank they find footprints, which seem human. As they investigate someone steals their clothes. The crew give chase seeing fleeting glimpse of humanoids through the thickening vegetation.Working their way to a clearing they find a tribe of native men and women harvesting food from a tree. The humanoids freeze as a bizarre noise echoes over the area, the sound sends the tribe into a stampede. The crew become swept up in the human tide and become part of the rout. Ahead they hear horses and gunfire, the men change direction realizing it is a trap and they are being hunted by ape like creatures riding on horses. Landon is knocked unconscious and captured. Dodge is shot and killed. The apes continue to herd the rest of the tribe into various traps till Taylor is shot in the neck.As quickly as it began the hunt ends. Dozens of humans have been captured, even more killed and collected as trophies. At a clinic, ape surgeons remove the bullet from Taylor's neck and continue to treat him.Doctor Zira (Kim Hunter), a chimpanzee scientist, wants Taylor kept alive so that experiments on his brain can be conducted. Taylor wakes later to find himself in a cage. Zira visits to see how the captured humans are going. She has given him the nickname 'Bright Eyes'.Taylor tries to communicate but can't speak because of his throat injury. Doctor Zaius (Maurice Evans), the orangutan Minister for Science, arrives at the lab to investigate the latest captured humans. Zira points out 'Bright Eyes' to Zaius, again Taylor fails to communicate. Zira is convinced of his intelligence but Zaius is unconvinced, and cautions Zira about her behavioral studies.Taylor discovers that the apes, who can talk, are in control and are divided into a strict caste system: the gorillas as police, military, hunters and workers; the orangutans as administrators, politicians, lawyers and religious clerics; and the chimpanzees as intellectuals and scientists. Humans, who cannot talk, are considered feral vermin and are hunted for sport and either killed outright, enslaved for manual labor, or used for scientific experimentation.Zira gives Taylor a human woman, Nova (Linda Harrison) and she is now assigned to his cage, hoping that she will mate with him. Days pass and Nova tries to bond with Taylor, but his own moral code stops him. Zira, becoming more excited by 'Bright Eyes' each day, invites her fiancé, Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) to the clinic see the progress she's made.At an outdoor confinement area near a large cage where the humans are kept, Zaius meets Cornelius who is an archeologist and planning another expedition into the so-called 'Forbidden Zone' (the vast desert where Taylor and his crew marched overland from their crash site) search of artifacts. During the conversation, Taylor attempts to communicate with them by writing a message in the dirt ground, but the other humans see this and wipe the marks away, implying to Taylor not to try to communicate with the apes. Then a fight between Taylor and another man breaks out. Taylor is removed by the gorilla guards to an isolated cage. However, Zaius discoverers the message Taylor was writing on the ground and rubs it out before anyone else can see it.Later, Zira gets close to Taylor's cage and he grabs her note book and pencil. Julius, (Buck Kartalian), the gorilla guard, enters the cage to beat up Taylor and retrieves the stolen items. Zira notices that Taylor has written a note that she understands that says ""my name is Taylor"". Stunned she speaks to Taylor one on one, realizing he really is intelligent.After taking Taylor out of his cage to her office, Zira tries to convince Cornelius of Taylor's origins. He refuses to believe that Taylor is no more than a hoax. Still mute because of his throat injury, Taylor points out a map and describes the journey the crew undertook by writing it down. Cornelius is even more disturbed that any creature could survive in the Forbidden Zone. Taylor takes an interest in Cornelius work and Zira explains in more detail that Cornelius theory that the apes evolved from a lower form of life such as the humans. In the Forbidden Zone, Cornelius claims to have discovered artifacts that point to a civilization that predates the current ape society. Zaius arrives and interrupts the discussion, and orders Taylor returned to the compound.Later in his cage, Taylor overhears orders that he is to be gelded (castrated). As the gorilla guards prepare him, he escapes into the ape village, first taking refuge in a church during a funeral. Discovered, he again escapes through a market place, then into a museum with various humans have been stuffed and put on exhibition. There he finds the body of Dodge. Back in the market place he is surrounded and subdued by apes. Suddenly Taylor discovers his voice has recovered and tells the crowd: ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes!""Back at the medical compound, Nova is removed from Taylor's cage. With his throat completely healed and able to speak again, Taylor reflects on the humor that for the first time he needs someone and she taken away. Over the next few days, Taylor, now alone in his cage, muses about Earth and the life left behind. One day, a group of apes come in where they collar and restrain Taylor before taking him via a horse-drawn wagon to a large building in the middle of the so-called 'Ape city' which Taylor reads from its name as the 'National Ministry'. In a large assembly hall, Taylor is seated at table where Cornelius and Zira are also seated. It soon becomes apparent to Taylor (and the viewers) that this hearing is actually a trial to decide Taylor's origin and fate. Three orangutans are the judges of the case; they are the President of the Ministry (James Whitmore), Dr. Maximus (Woodrow Parfrey), and Dr. Zaius. Zira and Cornelius have been appointed by the panel of judges to defend him. Taylor tries to speak, and is immediately restrained from doing so by the President of the Ministry who tells Taylor that under ape law, humans have no rights. A speech is given by Dr. Maximus defending the First Article of Faith that only apes should study apes.Dr. Zaius is called to testify where he argues before the court claiming that since Taylor was operated on his throat for his bullet injury, that Dr. Zira 'programmed' his vocal cords so he could appear to speak. Dr. Honorius (James Daly), the orangutan prosecutor, challenges Taylor to explain the Second Article of Faith and why humans have no soul. Taylor cannot because he claims that he has no knowledge of the ape's society or rules. Taylor then asks Cornelius to read a statement to the tribunal for him. But the tribunal refuses to allow the document to be entered into evidence since it was written by a human. Taylor claims there were other 'talking humans' when they arrive. The tribunal adjourns to inspect the survivors of the hunt.A little later, Taylor is led outside where his collar and restraints are removed and he is allowed to mingle with a group of recently captured humans. Taylor recognizes Landon in the group of humans brought out that were captured during the last hunt. He goes to talk Landon, only to discover a large scar on the side of his head. Taylor realizes that Landon has had most of his brain removed. Taylor physically attacks Zaius for performing a crude lobotomy on his friend, but is restrained before he can do any harm.The tribunal resumes where Dr. Zaius is re-called to testify claiming that the human (Landon) which Taylor pointed out suffered a head injury due to being shot and never could talk. Taylor disrupts the testimony by calling Zaius a liar, but he is again restrained and gagged by the gorilla guards standing beside him.Cornelius steps in and concedes that Taylor could not have come from outer space, but he clearly came from somewhere such as the past. Cornelius goes on to tell how accurately Taylor described the Forbidden Zone to them, and Cornelius own research shows a civilization predating the apes lived out there as well. The biased orangutan tribunal rejects the theory and counters by charging both Zira and Cornelius with contempt of court and heresy. The court adjourns to consider their fate as well as the fate of Taylor.Afterwords, Dr. Zaius takes Taylor to his private chambers and explains what Taylor's fate will be unless he co-operates. He challenges Taylor to admit where he really came from, but Taylor stands firm claiming to have come from a distant planet 2,000 years in the past where humans are the dominant species. Zaius then admits that he knew Landon could talk, and intentionally had a lobotomy performed on him to prevent him from talking and keeping the knowledge of intelligent humans suppressed from the ape public. Zaius tells Taylor that he belives that Taylor and his ""tribe"" originated from the other side of the Forbidden Zone and worries what they might do in the future. Zaius again tries to make Taylor admit that he comes from a tribe of intelligent humans, but Taylor continues to maintain that he comes from a distant planet in the past. Realizing that Taylor won't budge, Zaius orders the gorilla guards to send Taylor back to the clinical compound.A few nights later, a chimpanzee attendant, whom is Zira's socially-rebellious nephew Lucius (Lou Wagner), arrives at the compound to explain to the gorilla guard, Julius, that Taylor is being transferred to the zoo. Julius becomes suspicious and Lucius, with the help of Taylor, subdues him and escapes. Taylor insists on Nova coming on the escape.Taylor and Lucius meet up with Zira who disguises Taylor and takes them across country in a horse-drawn wagon. Later, Cornelius meets up with them bearing fresh horses and more supplies. To escape, Cornelius is going to lead the party back into the Forbidden Zone desert to where he found the artifacts a year before. He tells Taylor that only his discovery of the artifacts will prove him and Zira innocent of the heresy charges.They travel across the desert and reach the dig site at a cave overlooking a beach facing a vast ocean. Taylor examines the artifacts that Cornelius has discovered. As they do so, Zaius and a group of gorilla soldiers arrive and a brief fire fight develops before a truce is called by Zaius. He then tries to negotiate with Cornelius for him to retract his findings and Cornelius will get off lightly.Ultimately Taylor negotiates with Zaius that if Cornelius can prove his theory Zaius will let him off his charges. Zaius agrees and they enter the cave. Cornelius shows the diggings and explains that the deeper they dig the more advanced the culture seems to be come. Zaius brushes off Cornelius' argument as primitive and undeveloped. Finally Cornelius shows Zaius a human doll. Zaius does not understand the significance of the doll and dismisses it. Taylor looks over the other items and identified what they were. Again Zaius refuses to believe the evidence. Finally, Nova presses a button on the doll and it speaks. Taylor challenges him as to why apes would make a human doll that speaks.Outside the cave, the firefight erupts again. Lucius is overpowered and captured, but Taylor manages to kill and/or wound a number of the gorilla soldiers before faking an injury to draw Zaius out of the cave. Zaius is trapped and he is forced again to order his soldiers to retreat. Taylor tells the gorillas he wants food, a horse and ammunition and he will let Zaius go free.Taylor challenges the captive Zaius that he knew about the older civilization of humans and covered it up. Zaius admits he did know about it from the ancient writings. Zaius has Cornelius read one of the scrolls that he keeps with him at all times. According to Zaius, the writings give a dire warning about man and the danger he presents. Zaius argues that nothing Taylor has done proves the writings wrong. Zaius then admits that he always knew that an intelligent human like Taylor would show up sooner or later. When Taylor asks Zaius why he hates humans so much that they all must be killed to a point to being extinct, Zaius replies that he doesn't really hate humans, but he fears humans. Not for what they are, but for what they were. Zaius claims that man's high intelligence mixed with his need to war... to destroy. Zaius explains that the Forbidden Zone was once a paradise, but it was destroyed by man many hundreds of years ago.When Lucious is released and arrives with the horse and supplies, Taylor continues to argue with Zaius that he is going deeper into the Forbidden Zone to try and understand what happened... to find out how or what brought the previous culture to an end. Zaius warns Taylor that he might not like what he finds out there. Taylor says his goodbyes to Cornelius and Zira and rides on his horse off along the shore with Nova. After Taylor rides off, the gorilla soldiers appear and release Zaius, but he tells them not to chase after Taylor. He instead orders the cave to be destroyed and sealed, and orders his gorillas to arrest Cornelius, Zira, Lucius, telling the three chimpanzees that he will take them back to Ape City and they will stand trial for heresy after all. Zaius states that he and the ruling ministry will continue to cover up the true origins of humanity. When Zira asks Zaius about what Taylor might find out there in the Forbidden Zone, Zaius replies: ""his destiny.""After a number of days later, Taylor catches sight of something sticking out of the sand on the beach. Overcome with grief, he dismounts from his horse and falls to his knees in the sand of the surf, screaming to the sky. The camera pans out to show the Statue of Liberty half-buried in sand, and in a highly corroded state. He understands now that he has been on Earth the whole time, and Zaius was right. Humanity did destroy itself and apes became the dominant species.""Maniacs!! You finally blew it all up!!!"" Taylor screams in despair. ""God damn you all to hell!""The image fades to black.","

    Synopsis
    A ship in space, Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston) is at the controls. He's making a log entry about the journey so far. Although nearly six months out from Earth since they took off in 1972; they have traveled 700 years into the future due to their faster than light speed through a wormhole.Taylor takes an injection and returns to a stasis chamber to wait out the rest of the voyage with his three fellow astronauts. As he sleeps the ship continues on before encountering a planet and crashes into a lake. The ship awakens the crew, who immediately realize their situation. One of the four (a young woman) has died in stasis.Suddenly one of the bulkheads collapses and the ship begins to sink. The remaining three crewmen scramble to escape after being unsuccessful in sending a message to Earth. As Taylor leaves the ship he sees the ship's clock showing the year as 3978. They have been in space for over 2,000 years, yet by traveling through a hyperspace wormhole they have aged only about 20 months, with long beards to prove it.The three men, Taylor, Landon (Robert Gunner), Dodge (Jeff Burton) take to a raft and begin paddling along the shoreline looking for a safe place to camp. Taylor surmises that they are some 320 light years from Earth on a planet orbiting a star in the Orion system. Landon calls him out on this information claiming Taylor didn't have enough time to read the tapes before their ship sank.Coming ashore they take stock of their situation, they have food and water for three days and a handgun. Taylor tells the others about the clocks and proof they offer about the theory of relativity. Landon stops to plant an American flag before moving off.They begin their journey in the rocky desert, around them unseen figures move across the cliff tops watching their progress. Slowly the country changes and stray vegetation is seen. Passing an out crop they see wooden crosses planted in the ground resembling a borderline fence. Evidence something intelligent lives on the planet.Passing the crosses they see trees and can hear a waterfall. Realizing they may survive, they take all their clothes off and go for a swim in the lake. Further along on a muddy bank they find footprints, which seem human. As they investigate someone steals their clothes. The crew give chase seeing fleeting glimpse of humanoids through the thickening vegetation.Working their way to a clearing they find a tribe of native men and women harvesting food from a tree. The humanoids freeze as a bizarre noise echoes over the area, the sound sends the tribe into a stampede. The crew become swept up in the human tide and become part of the rout. Ahead they hear horses and gunfire, the men change direction realizing it is a trap and they are being hunted by ape like creatures riding on horses. Landon is knocked unconscious and captured. Dodge is shot and killed. The apes continue to herd the rest of the tribe into various traps till Taylor is shot in the neck.As quickly as it began the hunt ends. Dozens of humans have been captured, even more killed and collected as trophies. At a clinic, ape surgeons remove the bullet from Taylor's neck and continue to treat him.Doctor Zira (Kim Hunter), a chimpanzee scientist, wants Taylor kept alive so that experiments on his brain can be conducted. Taylor wakes later to find himself in a cage. Zira visits to see how the captured humans are going. She has given him the nickname 'Bright Eyes'.Taylor tries to communicate but can't speak because of his throat injury. Doctor Zaius (Maurice Evans), the orangutan Minister for Science, arrives at the lab to investigate the latest captured humans. Zira points out 'Bright Eyes' to Zaius, again Taylor fails to communicate. Zira is convinced of his intelligence but Zaius is unconvinced, and cautions Zira about her behavioral studies.Taylor discovers that the apes, who can talk, are in control and are divided into a strict caste system: the gorillas as police, military, hunters and workers; the orangutans as administrators, politicians, lawyers and religious clerics; and the chimpanzees as intellectuals and scientists. Humans, who cannot talk, are considered feral vermin and are hunted for sport and either killed outright, enslaved for manual labor, or used for scientific experimentation.Zira gives Taylor a human woman, Nova (Linda Harrison) and she is now assigned to his cage, hoping that she will mate with him. Days pass and Nova tries to bond with Taylor, but his own moral code stops him. Zira, becoming more excited by 'Bright Eyes' each day, invites her fiancé, Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) to the clinic see the progress she's made.At an outdoor confinement area near a large cage where the humans are kept, Zaius meets Cornelius who is an archeologist and planning another expedition into the so-called 'Forbidden Zone' (the vast desert where Taylor and his crew marched overland from their crash site) search of artifacts. During the conversation, Taylor attempts to communicate with them by writing a message in the dirt ground, but the other humans see this and wipe the marks away, implying to Taylor not to try to communicate with the apes. Then a fight between Taylor and another man breaks out. Taylor is removed by the gorilla guards to an isolated cage. However, Zaius discoverers the message Taylor was writing on the ground and rubs it out before anyone else can see it.Later, Zira gets close to Taylor's cage and he grabs her note book and pencil. Julius, (Buck Kartalian), the gorilla guard, enters the cage to beat up Taylor and retrieves the stolen items. Zira notices that Taylor has written a note that she understands that says ""my name is Taylor"". Stunned she speaks to Taylor one on one, realizing he really is intelligent.After taking Taylor out of his cage to her office, Zira tries to convince Cornelius of Taylor's origins. He refuses to believe that Taylor is no more than a hoax. Still mute because of his throat injury, Taylor points out a map and describes the journey the crew undertook by writing it down. Cornelius is even more disturbed that any creature could survive in the Forbidden Zone. Taylor takes an interest in Cornelius work and Zira explains in more detail that Cornelius theory that the apes evolved from a lower form of life such as the humans. In the Forbidden Zone, Cornelius claims to have discovered artifacts that point to a civilization that predates the current ape society. Zaius arrives and interrupts the discussion, and orders Taylor returned to the compound.Later in his cage, Taylor overhears orders that he is to be gelded (castrated). As the gorilla guards prepare him, he escapes into the ape village, first taking refuge in a church during a funeral. Discovered, he again escapes through a market place, then into a museum with various humans have been stuffed and put on exhibition. There he finds the body of Dodge. Back in the market place he is surrounded and subdued by apes. Suddenly Taylor discovers his voice has recovered and tells the crowd: ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes!""Back at the medical compound, Nova is removed from Taylor's cage. With his throat completely healed and able to speak again, Taylor reflects on the humor that for the first time he needs someone and she taken away. Over the next few days, Taylor, now alone in his cage, muses about Earth and the life left behind. One day, a group of apes come in where they collar and restrain Taylor before taking him via a horse-drawn wagon to a large building in the middle of the so-called 'Ape city' which Taylor reads from its name as the 'National Ministry'. In a large assembly hall, Taylor is seated at table where Cornelius and Zira are also seated. It soon becomes apparent to Taylor (and the viewers) that this hearing is actually a trial to decide Taylor's origin and fate. Three orangutans are the judges of the case; they are the President of the Ministry (James Whitmore), Dr. Maximus (Woodrow Parfrey), and Dr. Zaius. Zira and Cornelius have been appointed by the panel of judges to defend him. Taylor tries to speak, and is immediately restrained from doing so by the President of the Ministry who tells Taylor that under ape law, humans have no rights. A speech is given by Dr. Maximus defending the First Article of Faith that only apes should study apes.Dr. Zaius is called to testify where he argues before the court claiming that since Taylor was operated on his throat for his bullet injury, that Dr. Zira 'programmed' his vocal cords so he could appear to speak. Dr. Honorius (James Daly), the orangutan prosecutor, challenges Taylor to explain the Second Article of Faith and why humans have no soul. Taylor cannot because he claims that he has no knowledge of the ape's society or rules. Taylor then asks Cornelius to read a statement to the tribunal for him. But the tribunal refuses to allow the document to be entered into evidence since it was written by a human. Taylor claims there were other 'talking humans' when they arrive. The tribunal adjourns to inspect the survivors of the hunt.A little later, Taylor is led outside where his collar and restraints are removed and he is allowed to mingle with a group of recently captured humans. Taylor recognizes Landon in the group of humans brought out that were captured during the last hunt. He goes to talk Landon, only to discover a large scar on the side of his head. Taylor realizes that Landon has had most of his brain removed. Taylor physically attacks Zaius for performing a crude lobotomy on his friend, but is restrained before he can do any harm.The tribunal resumes where Dr. Zaius is re-called to testify claiming that the human (Landon) which Taylor pointed out suffered a head injury due to being shot and never could talk. Taylor disrupts the testimony by calling Zaius a liar, but he is again restrained and gagged by the gorilla guards standing beside him.Cornelius steps in and concedes that Taylor could not have come from outer space, but he clearly came from somewhere such as the past. Cornelius goes on to tell how accurately Taylor described the Forbidden Zone to them, and Cornelius own research shows a civilization predating the apes lived out there as well. The biased orangutan tribunal rejects the theory and counters by charging both Zira and Cornelius with contempt of court and heresy. The court adjourns to consider their fate as well as the fate of Taylor.Afterwords, Dr. Zaius takes Taylor to his private chambers and explains what Taylor's fate will be unless he co-operates. He challenges Taylor to admit where he really came from, but Taylor stands firm claiming to have come from a distant planet 2,000 years in the past where humans are the dominant species. Zaius then admits that he knew Landon could talk, and intentionally had a lobotomy performed on him to prevent him from talking and keeping the knowledge of intelligent humans suppressed from the ape public. Zaius tells Taylor that he belives that Taylor and his ""tribe"" originated from the other side of the Forbidden Zone and worries what they might do in the future. Zaius again tries to make Taylor admit that he comes from a tribe of intelligent humans, but Taylor continues to maintain that he comes from a distant planet in the past. Realizing that Taylor won't budge, Zaius orders the gorilla guards to send Taylor back to the clinical compound.A few nights later, a chimpanzee attendant, whom is Zira's socially-rebellious nephew Lucius (Lou Wagner), arrives at the compound to explain to the gorilla guard, Julius, that Taylor is being transferred to the zoo. Julius becomes suspicious and Lucius, with the help of Taylor, subdues him and escapes. Taylor insists on Nova coming on the escape.Taylor and Lucius meet up with Zira who disguises Taylor and takes them across country in a horse-drawn wagon. Later, Cornelius meets up with them bearing fresh horses and more supplies. To escape, Cornelius is going to lead the party back into the Forbidden Zone desert to where he found the artifacts a year before. He tells Taylor that only his discovery of the artifacts will prove him and Zira innocent of the heresy charges.They travel across the desert and reach the dig site at a cave overlooking a beach facing a vast ocean. Taylor examines the artifacts that Cornelius has discovered. As they do so, Zaius and a group of gorilla soldiers arrive and a brief fire fight develops before a truce is called by Zaius. He then tries to negotiate with Cornelius for him to retract his findings and Cornelius will get off lightly.Ultimately Taylor negotiates with Zaius that if Cornelius can prove his theory Zaius will let him off his charges. Zaius agrees and they enter the cave. Cornelius shows the diggings and explains that the deeper they dig the more advanced the culture seems to be come. Zaius brushes off Cornelius' argument as primitive and undeveloped. Finally Cornelius shows Zaius a human doll. Zaius does not understand the significance of the doll and dismisses it. Taylor looks over the other items and identified what they were. Again Zaius refuses to believe the evidence. Finally, Nova presses a button on the doll and it speaks. Taylor challenges him as to why apes would make a human doll that speaks.Outside the cave, the firefight erupts again. Lucius is overpowered and captured, but Taylor manages to kill and/or wound a number of the gorilla soldiers before faking an injury to draw Zaius out of the cave. Zaius is trapped and he is forced again to order his soldiers to retreat. Taylor tells the gorillas he wants food, a horse and ammunition and he will let Zaius go free.Taylor challenges the captive Zaius that he knew about the older civilization of humans and covered it up. Zaius admits he did know about it from the ancient writings. Zaius has Cornelius read one of the scrolls that he keeps with him at all times. According to Zaius, the writings give a dire warning about man and the danger he presents. Zaius argues that nothing Taylor has done proves the writings wrong. Zaius then admits that he always knew that an intelligent human like Taylor would show up sooner or later. When Taylor asks Zaius why he hates humans so much that they all must be killed to a point to being extinct, Zaius replies that he doesn't really hate humans, but he fears humans. Not for what they are, but for what they were. Zaius claims that man's high intelligence mixed with his need to war... to destroy. Zaius explains that the Forbidden Zone was once a paradise, but it was destroyed by man many hundreds of years ago.When Lucious is released and arrives with the horse and supplies, Taylor continues to argue with Zaius that he is going deeper into the Forbidden Zone to try and understand what happened... to find out how or what brought the previous culture to an end. Zaius warns Taylor that he might not like what he finds out there. Taylor says his goodbyes to Cornelius and Zira and rides on his horse off along the shore with Nova. After Taylor rides off, the gorilla soldiers appear and release Zaius, but he tells them not to chase after Taylor. He instead orders the cave to be destroyed and sealed, and orders his gorillas to arrest Cornelius, Zira, Lucius, telling the three chimpanzees that he will take them back to Ape City and they will stand trial for heresy after all. Zaius states that he and the ruling ministry will continue to cover up the true origins of humanity. When Zira asks Zaius about what Taylor might find out there in the Forbidden Zone, Zaius replies: ""his destiny.""After a number of days later, Taylor catches sight of something sticking out of the sand on the beach. Overcome with grief, he dismounts from his horse and falls to his knees in the sand of the surf, screaming to the sky. The camera pans out to show the Statue of Liberty half-buried in sand, and in a highly corroded state. He understands now that he has been on Earth the whole time, and Zaius was right. Humanity did destroy itself and apes became the dominant species.""Maniacs!! You finally blew it all up!!!"" Taylor screams in despair. ""God damn you all to hell!""The image fades to black.

"3","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Bickering siblings Johnny and Barbra are traveling by car to a rural cemetery, where they visit their father's grave. Johnny teases his sister's fear of the cemetery after dark, saying ""They're coming to get you, Barbra!"" They are approached by a pale-faced man who stumbles toward them and attacks Barbra. Johnny pulls the man off of Barbra and struggles with him, but is knocked unconscious and possibly dead after tripping and hitting his head violently on the edge of a gravestone. The man then pursues Barbra back to the car, but Barbra cannot start it because the keys are in Johnny's pocket. She takes the car out of gear and it begins to drift away on its own, but she accidentally steers it into a tree. She abandons the car and runs down a roadway to a nearby farmhouse, with the man still pursuing her. She discovers the house seemingly deserted, and the phone is out of order. Her attacker stumbles around the outside of the house looking for her, and is joined by several others. They all seem to be in a kind of trance, behaving in an animalistic way. Exploring the house further, Barbra makes a gruesome find at the top of the stairs: a human body that seems to have been partially devoured by something.In a panic and attempting to flee the house, Barbra is intercepted by Ben, who arrives in a pickup truck and attacks the mysterious figures with a tire iron. Barbra is further driven into hysteria when she sees Ben violently smashing the skulls of the strange men who keep trying to get into the house. Ben urges her into action and the two of them begin boarding up the doors and windows from the inside with dismantled furniture and scraps of wood. They awkwardly trade their stories; Ben seems to be a drifter who was passing through the area when suddenly a wave of unexplained violence began unfolding. He tells Barbra about a scene of mayhem that he encountered at a diner, and Barbra tells him about the incident with Johnny in the cemetery. When Barbra becomes hysterical and wants to go out after Johnny, she strikes Ben and Ben hits her in the face. Barbra passes out in shock.Ben goes upstairs and finds a rifle and a radio as Barbra lies incapacitated on a couch in the living room listening to the radio report. Emergency broadcasters tell stories of widespread violence and mayhem being committed by people who seem to be in a 'trance'. Suddenly, Barbra is startled when the cellar door opens and two men emerge from the basement. Ben is attracted by her screams and they confront the newcomers. An older middle-aged man introduces himself as Harry Cooper, and the younger man is named Tom. Harry says that he has his wife, Helen, and his daughter, Karen, are in the basement as well. Karen has been hurt and cannot be moved. Tom has a girlfriend named Judy, also in the cellar.Immediately the group begins bickering. Ben is furious with Tom and Harry for not coming out earlier to help him barricade the house. Harry is an irrational and domineering man who insists that they all barricade themselves in the cellar and wait for help. Ben refuses, saying that if their attackers ever got into the cellar, it would be the end of all of them, as there is only one entrance -- if they stay upstairs they have a ""fighting chance"" to hold off their attackers outside. Harry angrily retreats to the cellar with Helen and Karen, and Judy comes upstairs to be with the rest of the group. When his wife, Helen, learns about the group and that they have a radio that keeps them informed, she insists that they go upstairs into the house to help out.Radio reports explain that an epidemic of mass murder is sweeping across the eastern seaboard of the United States. Later, Ben discovers a television and the whole group watches the emergency broadcaster who reveals that the murderers are recently deceased human beings who have returned to life and who are consuming their victims' flesh. Experts including scientists and military generals are not sure of the cause of the reanimation, but one scientist is certain that it is the result of radiation emanating from a Venus space probe that exploded in the Earth's atmosphere. The report instructs that a gunshot or heavy blow to the head will stop the ""ghouls"" and that posses of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.The TV broadcast provides a constantly scrolling list of local towns that contain ""rescue stations"" to provide citizens with protection and necessities. Ben notices a nearby town called Willard and devises a plan to escape using his truck, but it needs refueling. While Harry throws Molotov cocktails out a second floor window at the walking dead outside the house, Ben exits the house armed with the rifle and a flaming torch. Tom and Judy offer assistance, but when they arrive at a fuel pump near the house, Tom carelessly splashes gasoline on the torch, starting a grass fire that quickly spreads to cover the truck. Judy's sleeve is caught on something inside the truck which explodes with Tom and Judy inside. Ben runs back to the house to find that Harry locked him out. He kicks the door open and forces his way inside, and after Harry helps him board up the front door again, he punches Harry repeatedly for his cowardice. As Cooper watches in horror, some of the living dead begin eating Tom and Judy's charred remains.A little later, another broadcast comes on the television, showing a local news reporter (Bill Cardille) interviewing a local sheriff (George Kosana) about the search and rescue operations that are underway in the area. Another news report indicates that the levels of the ""mysterious radiation"" in the area have been increasing, suggesting that the phenomenon is going to become even more widespread than it already is, but also that the situation is going to be under control soon. At that moment, the house goes dark when the area loses power. Perhaps triggered by the darkness, the ghouls surrounding the house begin to attack, attempting to break through all of the boarded up the doors and windows of the house. Ben manages to hold them back, but drops his rifle. Harry seizes the fallen rifle and turns it on Ben. Cooper orders his wife to go down to the cellar. Ben manages to wrest the rifle away from Harry and then shoots him. Harry stumbles into the cellar and dies, approaching Karen's seemingly lifeless body.Helen also attempts to hold off the zombies, whose great numbers are beginning to overwhelm the barricades over the windows and doors. Barbra suddenly comes out of her catatonic state throws herself into the battle, and Helen escapes back into the cellar, where she discovers that her daughter has been transformed into one of the living dead and is consuming part of Harry's corpse. Karen stabs her mother repeatedly with a cement trowel, killing her, before going upstairs.Meanwhile, the undead finally break into the house and Barbra sees her brother Johnny among them. The resultant shock causes her to lower her defenses and she is carried away into the zombie horde. (Barbra's fate is not shown, but it is strongly assumed that she is eaten alive by the mob of flesh-eating ghouls). Then, the zombie Karen comes up from the basement and attacks Ben, but he sidesteps her and retreats into the cellar, locking the door behind him (which, ironically, was Harry's plan all along). He shoots the reanimated Harry and Helen Cooper. With nowhere to go, Ben crouches in a corner of the basement with his rifle ready to make his last stand, while the undead walk through the house as well as pound on the boarded up basement door. The ghouls cannot get into the basement.In the morning, the undead mob has left the house and disbursed. A posse approaches the house and proceeds to kill the remaining zombies lurking around the house. Hearing the commotion and gunshots, Ben cautiously goes up the cellar stairs into the living room, but is shot in the head by an overzealous posse member who mistakes him for a zombie. His body is carried from the house and burned in a large bonfire with the zombie corpses.","
    
                    Barbra and Johnny visit their father's grave in a remote cemetery when they are suddenly set upon by zombies. Barbra manages to get away and takes refuge in what seems to be an abandoned farm house. She is soon joined by Ben who stopped at the house in need of gas. Beset by the walking dead all around them Ben does his best to secure the doors and windows. The news reports are grim however with creatures returning to life everywhere. Barbra and Ben are surprised when they realize there are 5 people hiding out in the basement: Harry, Helen and Judy Cooper; and a young couple, Tom and Judy. Dissensions sets in almost immediately with Harry Cooper wanting to be in charge. As their situation deteriorates, their chances of surviving the night lessen minute by minute.

                    The dead come back to life and eat the living in this low budget, black and white film. Several people barricade themselves inside a rural house in an attempt to survive the night. Outside are hordes of relentless, shambling zombies who can only be killed by a blow to the head.

                    Chaos descends upon the world as the brains of the recently deceased become inexplicably reanimated, causing the dead to rise and feed on human flesh. Speculation rests on a radiation-covered NASA satellite returning from Venus, but it only remains a speculation. Anyone who dies during the crisis of causes unrelated to brain trauma will return as a flesh-eating zombie, including anyone who has been bitten by a zombie. The only way to destroy the zombies is to destroy the brain. As the catastrophe unfolds, a young woman visiting her father's grave takes refuge in a nearby farmhouse, where she is met by a man who protects her and barricades them inside. They both later discover people hiding in the basement, and they each attempt to cope with the situation. Their only hope rests on getting some gasoline from a nearby pump into a truck that is running on empty, but this requires braving the hordes of ravenous walking corpses outside. When they finally put their plans into action, panic and personal tensions only add to the terror as they try to survive.

    Synopsis
    Bickering siblings Johnny and Barbra are traveling by car to a rural cemetery, where they visit their father's grave. Johnny teases his sister's fear of the cemetery after dark, saying ""They're coming to get you, Barbra!"" They are approached by a pale-faced man who stumbles toward them and attacks Barbra. Johnny pulls the man off of Barbra and struggles with him, but is knocked unconscious and possibly dead after tripping and hitting his head violently on the edge of a gravestone. The man then pursues Barbra back to the car, but Barbra cannot start it because the keys are in Johnny's pocket. She takes the car out of gear and it begins to drift away on its own, but she accidentally steers it into a tree. She abandons the car and runs down a roadway to a nearby farmhouse, with the man still pursuing her. She discovers the house seemingly deserted, and the phone is out of order. Her attacker stumbles around the outside of the house looking for her, and is joined by several others. They all seem to be in a kind of trance, behaving in an animalistic way. Exploring the house further, Barbra makes a gruesome find at the top of the stairs: a human body that seems to have been partially devoured by something.In a panic and attempting to flee the house, Barbra is intercepted by Ben, who arrives in a pickup truck and attacks the mysterious figures with a tire iron. Barbra is further driven into hysteria when she sees Ben violently smashing the skulls of the strange men who keep trying to get into the house. Ben urges her into action and the two of them begin boarding up the doors and windows from the inside with dismantled furniture and scraps of wood. They awkwardly trade their stories; Ben seems to be a drifter who was passing through the area when suddenly a wave of unexplained violence began unfolding. He tells Barbra about a scene of mayhem that he encountered at a diner, and Barbra tells him about the incident with Johnny in the cemetery. When Barbra becomes hysterical and wants to go out after Johnny, she strikes Ben and Ben hits her in the face. Barbra passes out in shock.Ben goes upstairs and finds a rifle and a radio as Barbra lies incapacitated on a couch in the living room listening to the radio report. Emergency broadcasters tell stories of widespread violence and mayhem being committed by people who seem to be in a 'trance'. Suddenly, Barbra is startled when the cellar door opens and two men emerge from the basement. Ben is attracted by her screams and they confront the newcomers. An older middle-aged man introduces himself as Harry Cooper, and the younger man is named Tom. Harry says that he has his wife, Helen, and his daughter, Karen, are in the basement as well. Karen has been hurt and cannot be moved. Tom has a girlfriend named Judy, also in the cellar.Immediately the group begins bickering. Ben is furious with Tom and Harry for not coming out earlier to help him barricade the house. Harry is an irrational and domineering man who insists that they all barricade themselves in the cellar and wait for help. Ben refuses, saying that if their attackers ever got into the cellar, it would be the end of all of them, as there is only one entrance -- if they stay upstairs they have a ""fighting chance"" to hold off their attackers outside. Harry angrily retreats to the cellar with Helen and Karen, and Judy comes upstairs to be with the rest of the group. When his wife, Helen, learns about the group and that they have a radio that keeps them informed, she insists that they go upstairs into the house to help out.Radio reports explain that an epidemic of mass murder is sweeping across the eastern seaboard of the United States. Later, Ben discovers a television and the whole group watches the emergency broadcaster who reveals that the murderers are recently deceased human beings who have returned to life and who are consuming their victims' flesh. Experts including scientists and military generals are not sure of the cause of the reanimation, but one scientist is certain that it is the result of radiation emanating from a Venus space probe that exploded in the Earth's atmosphere. The report instructs that a gunshot or heavy blow to the head will stop the ""ghouls"" and that posses of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.The TV broadcast provides a constantly scrolling list of local towns that contain ""rescue stations"" to provide citizens with protection and necessities. Ben notices a nearby town called Willard and devises a plan to escape using his truck, but it needs refueling. While Harry throws Molotov cocktails out a second floor window at the walking dead outside the house, Ben exits the house armed with the rifle and a flaming torch. Tom and Judy offer assistance, but when they arrive at a fuel pump near the house, Tom carelessly splashes gasoline on the torch, starting a grass fire that quickly spreads to cover the truck. Judy's sleeve is caught on something inside the truck which explodes with Tom and Judy inside. Ben runs back to the house to find that Harry locked him out. He kicks the door open and forces his way inside, and after Harry helps him board up the front door again, he punches Harry repeatedly for his cowardice. As Cooper watches in horror, some of the living dead begin eating Tom and Judy's charred remains.A little later, another broadcast comes on the television, showing a local news reporter (Bill Cardille) interviewing a local sheriff (George Kosana) about the search and rescue operations that are underway in the area. Another news report indicates that the levels of the ""mysterious radiation"" in the area have been increasing, suggesting that the phenomenon is going to become even more widespread than it already is, but also that the situation is going to be under control soon. At that moment, the house goes dark when the area loses power. Perhaps triggered by the darkness, the ghouls surrounding the house begin to attack, attempting to break through all of the boarded up the doors and windows of the house. Ben manages to hold them back, but drops his rifle. Harry seizes the fallen rifle and turns it on Ben. Cooper orders his wife to go down to the cellar. Ben manages to wrest the rifle away from Harry and then shoots him. Harry stumbles into the cellar and dies, approaching Karen's seemingly lifeless body.Helen also attempts to hold off the zombies, whose great numbers are beginning to overwhelm the barricades over the windows and doors. Barbra suddenly comes out of her catatonic state throws herself into the battle, and Helen escapes back into the cellar, where she discovers that her daughter has been transformed into one of the living dead and is consuming part of Harry's corpse. Karen stabs her mother repeatedly with a cement trowel, killing her, before going upstairs.Meanwhile, the undead finally break into the house and Barbra sees her brother Johnny among them. The resultant shock causes her to lower her defenses and she is carried away into the zombie horde. (Barbra's fate is not shown, but it is strongly assumed that she is eaten alive by the mob of flesh-eating ghouls). Then, the zombie Karen comes up from the basement and attacks Ben, but he sidesteps her and retreats into the cellar, locking the door behind him (which, ironically, was Harry's plan all along). He shoots the reanimated Harry and Helen Cooper. With nowhere to go, Ben crouches in a corner of the basement with his rifle ready to make his last stand, while the undead walk through the house as well as pound on the boarded up basement door. The ghouls cannot get into the basement.In the morning, the undead mob has left the house and disbursed. A posse approaches the house and proceeds to kill the remaining zombies lurking around the house. Hearing the commotion and gunshots, Ben cautiously goes up the cellar stairs into the living room, but is shot in the head by an overzealous posse member who mistakes him for a zombie. His body is carried from the house and burned in a large bonfire with the zombie corpses.

A leopard attacks an ape. While one group of apes is drinking at a waterhole, another group approaches; the two groups scream at each other and one party is driven off. At night the apes huddle in fear among the rocks. In the morning a tall, thin, rectangular black monolith stands among the rocks. The apes are excited but touch the object and calm down. (Soundtrack: György Ligeti's ""Requiem."")An ape (Daniel Richter) lifts a femur bone from a skeletal pile and realizes it makes a fine weapon. (Soundtrack: ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" again.) The ape realizes that it can destroy other bones with the club. Three turning points in evolution happen simultaneously: proto-humans learn to kill with weapons, to hunt using weapons and eat meat, and to walk upright. Club-carrying apes approach the group that drove them away from their waterhole. The club-carriers bludgeon the other group's alpha male to death and chase off the rest. The victorious alpha male throws his club and it spins into the air.TMA-1, or the Monolith on the Moon(No title card introduces this section of the film)The spinning bone segues to spaceships above Earth. A Pan-Am space shuttle approaches a large spinning space station, its revolutions mirroring those of the ape's spinning bone. As a single passenger dozes in his seat, a flight attendant with Velcro shoes recovers his floating pen. The shuttle pilots carefully match rotation and steer the shuttle into the station's central docking bay. (Soundtrack: Johann Strauss' Blue Danube waltz.)Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) meets an old friend in the arrivals lounge. They go through a voiceprint security check in which Floyd identifies his destination: the moon. The men chat; Dr. Floyd has a connecting flight in one hour. Floyd calls home from a video payphone booth and talks to his young daughter (Vivian Kubrick), whose birthday is the next day. He's sorry he'll miss her party but asks her what sort of present she wants; she asks for a bush-baby. The cost of the call is $1.70.In the Hilton lounge, Floyd stops to chat with some Russian scientists on their way back to Earth. When Floyd mentions he is going to Clavius, the Russians say no one has had contact with Clavius for 10 days and there are rumors of an epidemic. Floyd says he cannot discuss the matter and goes on his way.A smaller spaceship approaches the moon. A flight attendant serves food trays that consist of many compartments of liquid nourishment labeled with pictures -- carrots, peas, and so on. Floyd sips his meal, talks briefly with one of the flight officers, then contemplates the long list of instructions for the zero-G toilet. He watches the moon approach. The craft lands in a domed landing pad then descends underground to the main complex, once again to Johann Strauss' stately Viennese waltz.Floyd is introduced to a group of people in a conference room. He congratulates them on their discovery. He tries to explain the need for secrecy and the epidemic cover story. Floyd has come to get more facts and write a report for ""the Council.""A shuttle skims over the lunar landscape. Inside, Floyd and two scientists enjoy sandwiches and review the findings. A magnetic object was found and excavated. They're not sure what it is, only that it was deliberately buried four million years ago.At the dig site, a tall, thin, black rectangular monolith -- identical to the one the apes encountered -- is examined by six people in spacesuits. (Soundtrack: György Ligeti's ""Requiem"" again.) As they pose for a photo the object emits a loud, high-pitched noise and the astronauts grab their heads in pain.Jupiter Mission 18 Months LaterA long narrow spacecraft moves through space, its parabolic antennae pointing backwards. In the crew compartment, Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) jogs around the artificial gravity wheel. Along the narrow corridor formed by the edge of the wheel, he runs past work stations, communications equipment, and five large, coffin-like life support chambers with glass covers. Two are unoccupied and three hold white, sarcophagus-shaped pods containing hibernating members of the crew.Frank is joined by Commander Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea). The two men have a meal and watch a BBC news video from earlier that day. The news report is about them and their ship, the Discovery, 80 million miles from Earth. The report mentions the three astronauts who are in hibernation to save air and food; they will be needed at the destination for a survey. The sixth member of the crew is the HAL9000 computer, which can talk and mimic the human brain. The newscaster interviews Dave and Frank together and then speaks to Hal (Douglas Rain), who states he is foolproof and incapable of error.Frank catches some UV rays on a tanning bed and watches a video birthday greeting from his parents. Hal also wishes Frank a happy birthday. Frank and Hal play chess -- Hal wins. Dave sketches and shows his artwork to Hal. The computer expresses some concern about the mission and secrecy. Hal then announces there is a problem with the AE-35 unit and it will fail with 100% certainty within 72 hours. Dave and Frank discuss the problem with Mission Control; they need to ""go EVA"" (outside the ship -- extra-vehicular activity) to replace the unit. Dave goes out in a spherical EVA pod to the parabolic dish antennae in the center of the long ship. He leaves the pod and swaps out the black box from a service panel.Later the two astronauts scan the removed AE-35 unit but can't find any defects. Hal suggests putting it back in service to let it fail. Mission Control believes Hal has made an error because their HAL9000 unit, a twin to the one aboard Discovery, finds no flaw in the AE-35. Hal says that similar problems in the past have always proved not to be his fault (""It can only be attributable to human error"") and denies any chance of computer error. Dave and Frank go to a pod to have a private chat under the ruse of looking at a communications problem.Dave turns off all the pod's communications switches and the two men share their worries about Hal. If the AE-35 unit doesn't fail as predicted, the astronauts decide to disable Hal's higher functions without disturbing the automatic ship control functions, which Dave says will be tricky to do. Dave also wonders how Hal will react, because no 9000 unit has ever been disconnected before. Hal can see the men through the pod's window and reads their lips.This time Frank goes out in the EVA pod. As Frank approaches the dish assembly the pod sneaks up behind him. Suddenly Frank is spinning off into space fumbling for his air hose, which is disconnected, and the pod is drifting in the other direction. As Frank tumbles away, his voluntary movements slow and stop. Dave goes to the pod bay as Hal says he doesn't know what happened. Dave uses a pod to recover Frank's body. While he's away, a computer malfunction alert goes off and the life signs of the three hibernating astronauts flat-line. A display reads ""Life functions terminated."" Hal refuses to open the pod bay doors for Dave, explaining that he knows Dave is planning to disconnect him because he was able to read Frank and Dave's lips when they discussed it. He says the mission is too important to allow humans to jeopardize it. Dave says he'll return to the ship through the airlock; Hal replies that Dave will find that difficult without his helmet -- which, indeed, Dave forgot in his hurry to go after Frank. Hal ends the conversation.Dave releases Frank's body and maneuvers the pod to the emergency airlock hatch. He uses the pod's arms to open the door, then lines up the pod's hatch with the opening. Dave holds his breath and jumps over to the ship, where he's tossed around by escaping air before he's able to close the hatch. Now in a helmet, Dave goes to the computer room and climbs into an access compartment. Hal pleads for himself as Dave pulls crystals from the memory center. Hal's voice gets lower and slower as he sings ""Daisy Bell"" (Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do, I'm half crazy all for the love of you), and fades out as he is completely shut down. (Hal's performance is a nod to a speech synthesis project at Bell Laboratories in which an IBM 704 was programmed to sing the same song.) Suddenly a video screen comes on and plays a recording of Dr. Floyd explaining the secret purpose of the mission: ""This is a prerecorded briefing made prior to your departure and which for security reasons of the highest importance has been known on board during the mission only by your HAL9000 computer. Now that you are in Jupiter's space and the entire crew is revived it can be told to you. Eighteen months ago, the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth was discovered. It was buried 40 feet below the lunar surface near the crater Tycho. Except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, the four-million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery.""Jupiter and Beyond the InfiniteClose to Jupiter, another black monolith floats among the many moons. We hear György Ligeti's ""Requiem"" once again. Bowman leaves the Discovery in another EVA pod. As the monolith and moons align, a psychedelic light show begins and the pod enters a wormhole to the music of Ligeti's ""Atmosphères."" Dave sees a series of oddly-colored landscapes as if he was flying over them. The pod ends up somewhere in time and space in a bedroom with a luminous white floor and furniture in the style of Louis XVI. Dave gets out, now a trembling grey-haired man. Next door in a similarly styled bathroom, Dave looks at himself in a mirror. Back in the bedroom someone is sitting at a table eating. It's Dave again, now much older and dressed in a dark velour robe. Old Dave has a drink of wine; the glass falls to the floor and breaks. Another man lies sleeping on the bed. It is a still older Dave, who stirs and raises an arm. The black monolith appears in the center of the room. Dave is transformed into a fetus in a sac. Floating in space, the large open-eyed fetus -- the Star Child -- gazes at the nearby Earth. Soundtrack: ""Thus Spake Zarathustra.""","
    
                    ""2001"" is a story of evolution. Sometime in the distant past, someone or something nudged evolution by placing a monolith on Earth (presumably elsewhere throughout the universe as well). Evolution then enabled humankind to reach the moon's surface, where yet another monolith is found, one that signals the monolith placers that humankind has evolved that far. Now a race begins between computers (HAL) and human (Bowman) to reach the monolith placers. The winner will achieve the next step in evolution, whatever that may be.

                    A black monolith has an affect on humans, the monolith's effects focusing on two specific time periods. The first period is four million years ago, at the dawn of man. After the appearance of the monolith, the ape men begin to display behavior unknown before then. The second period is the near future, in the year 2001. There are five astronauts aboard Discovery One, which is on a mission to Jupiter. At the beginning of the mission, the reason for it is unknown to the five astronauts. Three of the astronauts are in hibernation at the start of the mission to preserve the manpower over its entire course, leaving mission commander Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole as the two manning the spacecraft. There is another what is often considered ""sixth"" astronaut on board, HAL 9000 - referred to simply as Hal - the artificial intelligent computer which controls all of the craft's functions, including the systems keeping the three hibernating astronauts alive. Hal is made all the more astronaut-like as it is given an artificial voice, Hal and the astronauts often having conversations. A 9000 series computer is considered infallible, any error one has ever made being human caused. Ultimately, Bowman and Poole believe that Hal is malfunctioning, they are unaware that Hal's behavior is due to knowledge of classified information it has about events at Clavius, a lunar outpost, eighteen months earlier. However, the issue between the astronauts and Hal becomes a fight for survival. The mission in its entirety has profound consequences for the human race.

                    This movie is concerned with intelligence as the division between animal and human, then asks a question: what is the next division? Technology is treated as irrelevant to the quest--literally serving as mere vehicles for the human crew and as a shell for the immature HAL entity. Story told as a montage of impressions, music, and impressive and careful attention to subliminal detail. A very influential film and still a class act, even after 25 years.

Hal suggests putting it back in service to let it fail. Mission Control believes Hal has made an error because their HAL9000 unit, a twin to the one aboard Discovery, finds no flaw in the AE-35. Hal says that similar problems in the past have always proved not to be his fault (""It can only be attributable to human error"") and denies any chance of computer error. Dave and Frank go to a pod to have a private chat under the ruse of looking at a communications problem.Dave turns off all the pod's communications switches and the two men share their worries about Hal. If the AE-35 unit doesn't fail as predicted, the astronauts decide to disable Hal's higher functions without disturbing the automatic ship control functions, which Dave says will be tricky to do. Dave also wonders how Hal will react, because no 9000 unit has ever been disconnected before. Hal can see the men through the pod's window and reads their lips.This time Frank goes out in the EVA pod. As Frank approaches the dish assembly the pod sneaks up behind him. Suddenly Frank is spinning off into space fumbling for his air hose, which is disconnected, and the pod is drifting in the other direction. As Frank tumbles away, his voluntary movements slow and stop. Dave goes to the pod bay as Hal says he doesn't know what happened. Dave uses a pod to recover Frank's body. While he's away, a computer malfunction alert goes off and the life signs of the three hibernating astronauts flat-line. A display reads ""Life functions terminated."" Hal refuses to open the pod bay doors for Dave, explaining that he knows Dave is planning to disconnect him because he was able to read Frank and Dave's lips when they discussed it. He says the mission is too important to allow humans to jeopardize it. Dave says he'll return to the ship through the airlock; Hal replies that Dave will find that difficult without his helmet -- which, indeed, Dave forgot in his hurry to go after Frank. Hal ends the conversation.Dave releases Frank's body and maneuvers the pod to the emergency airlock hatch. He uses the pod's arms to open the door, then lines up the pod's hatch with the opening. Dave holds his breath and jumps over to the ship, where he's tossed around by escaping air before he's able to close the hatch. Now in a helmet, Dave goes to the computer room and climbs into an access compartment. Hal pleads for himself as Dave pulls crystals from the memory center. Hal's voice gets lower and slower as he sings ""Daisy Bell"" (Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do, I'm half crazy all for the love of you), and fades out as he is completely shut down. (Hal's performance is a nod to a speech synthesis project at Bell Laboratories in which an IBM 704 was programmed to sing the same song.) Suddenly a video screen comes on and plays a recording of Dr. Floyd explaining the secret purpose of the mission: ""This is a prerecorded briefing made prior to your departure and which for security reasons of the highest importance has been known on board during the mission only by your HAL9000 computer. Now that you are in Jupiter's space and the entire crew is revived it can be told to you. Eighteen months ago, the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth was discovered. It was buried 40 feet below the lunar surface near the crater Tycho. Except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, the four-million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery.""Jupiter and Beyond the InfiniteClose to Jupiter, another black monolith floats among the many moons. We hear György Ligeti's ""Requiem"" once again. Bowman leaves the Discovery in another EVA pod. As the monolith and moons align, a psychedelic light show begins and the pod enters a wormhole to the music of Ligeti's ""Atmosphères."" Dave sees a series of oddly-colored landscapes as if he was flying over them. The pod ends up somewhere in time and space in a bedroom with a luminous white floor and furniture in the style of Louis XVI. Dave gets out, now a trembling grey-haired man. Next door in a similarly styled bathroom, Dave looks at himself in a mirror. Back in the bedroom someone is sitting at a table eating. It's Dave again, now much older and dressed in a dark velour robe. Old Dave has a drink of wine; the glass falls to the floor and breaks. Another man lies sleeping on the bed. It is a still older Dave, who stirs and raises an arm. The black monolith appears in the center of the room. Dave is transformed into a fetus in a sac. Floating in space, the large open-eyed fetus -- the Star Child -- gazes at the nearby Earth. Soundtrack: ""Thus Spake Zarathustra.""

He is abducted and Barbarella is cornered by a pair of ruffians who seem to have rape on their minds, but before they can lay a hand on Barbarella, they're both stabbed in the back by a woman with an eyepatch. The woman wants to ""play"" with Barbarella, but Barbarella rejects her advances and runs off to find Pygar.She sees the angel up on another level of the city, drawing jeers from a mob. Shielding him from the mob, she tells Pygar to back up since there's a room behind them.

"6","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064116/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In the desert Southwest of America during the waning days of the Old West, three gunmen (Jack Elam, Woody Strode, Al Mulock) approach an isolated train depot; two are wearing duster overcoats. The men take over the station and settle in to wait for the train. When the train finally comes, a nameless harmonica-playing stranger (Charles Bronson) gets off and asks for someone named Frank. They tell him Frank sent them in his place. In the ensuing showdown, all four men go down. Only the man with the harmonica gets up again.The soundtrack to the opening scene is a creative orchestration of ordinary sounds in the style of John Cage. Composer Ennio Morricone uses dripping water, the clicking of a telegraph, a buzzing fly, and over all the persistent, annoying squeak of a windmill-powered pump to build tension, punctuate visual jokes, and emphasize the tedium of waiting for the train. The scant dialog allows the soundtrack to consume much more of our attention than a score usually does.On a remote farm called Sweetwater, Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his children are preparing an outdoor wedding feast. McBain tells his son Patrick to drive into town to pick up his new mother, who is arriving by train from New Orleans. Suddenly shots ring out from the desert, and McBain's daughter Maureen, son Patrick, and McBain himself are slain. The youngest McBain, Timmy, runs out of the house to find that his entire family has been destroyed. He watches in terrified silence as a group of five gunmen in duster overcoats emerge from the scrub brush. When one of the men calls their leader Frank by name, asking what to do with the child, Frank (Henry Fonda) draws his pistol and slowly takes aim at the last remaining witness. With a self-satisfied grin, he pulls the trigger.In the town of Flagstone, McBain's bride Jill (Claudia Cardinale) steps down from the train to find that no one is there to meet her. Giving up hope, she steps through the train station into the bustling new town still being built. She hires a carriage to drive her to Sweetwater. The farm's name draws laughter from the driver, Sam (Paolo Stoppa), who informs her that ""Sweetwater"" is a worthless piece of ground, and McBain is crazy for trying to farm it.Along the way, Sam speeds through a group of railroad workers busily laying their ""damn rails."" Then he stops at a wayside inn/tavern/trading post, and Jill follows him inside. Her beauty draws the unwelcome attentions of the barman (Lionel Stander). After a noisy off-screen gun battle, the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) enters wearing shackles on his wrists. The sounds of a harmonica again reveals the presence of the nameless stranger, who has been watching from a dark corner of the tavern. Cheyenne dubs him ""Harmonica,"" and he uses Harmonica's gun to force another patron to shoot apart the chain between his wrists. Cheyenne's men soon arrive, too late to help him escape the prison guards who now lie dead outside. Harmonica notes that the three men he killed earlier were wearing the same duster overcoats as Cheyenne's men, and Cheyenne is annoyed that rivals may be copying his trademark dusters.Jill and Sam arrive at Sweetwater to find a crowd of somber wedding guests standing around the outdoor tables, now put to use as funeral biers. Jill is horrified at the carnage. When one of the women bemoans that this should happen to the ""poor little miss"" on her wedding day, Jill informs the guests that she and Brett McBain were married a month earlier in New Orleans. As the burial comes to an end, the crowd discovers that the torn-off collar of a duster overcoat was found on a nail by the door. This marks the massacre as Cheyenne's work. The men form a posse and ride off to track down the outlaw and hang him. Sam offers to drive Jill back to Flagstone, but she says she will stay at Sweetwater. That evening, she ransacks the McBain household, looking for anything of value that might have been hidden away.At the town laundry in Flagstone that night, Harmonica puts the laundry man Wobbles through a violent interrogation, wanting to know why Frank didn't show up at the train. Wobbles doesn't know; he only arranged the meeting. Harmonica suspects Frank was occupied at McBain's farm just then, but Wobbles insists otherwise: ""Cheyenne did that job--everyone knows that. We got proof."" Harmonica doesn't believe it: ""That was always one of Frank's tricks--fakin' evidence.""Jill finds a group of miniature buildings stored away in a trunk, including a model train station with a fancy swinging sign that says ""STATION."" She hears the sound of a harmonica outside and fires a shotgun into the darkness. The sound of the harmonica moves farther away. In the morning as she is about to leave for good, she finds Cheyenne on her doorstep. While his men wait outside, he barges in and asks for coffee. He tells of being chased by the posse all night and helps make the fire for the coffee. He says he would never kill a kid: ""I ain't the mean bastard people make out."" He decided to come take a look at the scene of his supposed crime. Not only is he annoyed that someone is trying to blame him, but neither he nor Jill can understand why the killings happened at all. The place looks so worthless, he imagines that McBain must have hidden a treasure away somewhere. Jill tells him that if so, she couldn't find it. Aware that she is vulnerable to any sort of mistreatment Cheyenne and his men might deal out, she serves the coffee.In a private railroad car, Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti), a crippled and dying railroad tycoon, berates Frank for killing the McBains. He only wanted Frank to scare McBain, not kill him. And now a Mrs. McBain has shown up, making the killings pointless. Morton began building his railroad in sight of the Atlantic Ocean, and he means to build his way to the Pacific before he dies. He hired Frank to ""remove small obstacles from the tracks,"" but Frank intends to become a wealthy businessman himself. Morton tells Frank he will never be like Morton, because Frank doesn't understand that money is more powerful than guns.After sharing a congenial interlude with Jill, Cheyenne finishes his coffee and rides away with his men. Jill takes her traveling bags out to the wagon. But Harmonica is there and demands that she stay. As he throws her down roughly and begins ripping at her clothes, Jill becomes alarmed. Instead of harming her, he simply removes the white trimmings from her black dress, leaving her in full mourning. They go to the well for a drink of water, only to be attacked by two more of Frank's men. Harmonica kills them, and from a nearby vantage point Cheyenne sees how handy Harmonica is with a gun.Jill goes to the laundry and asks Wobbles to tell Frank she knows everything and wants to negotiate with Frank personally. Wobbles denies knowing anyone named Frank, but Jill repeats her demand and leaves. Wobbles heads out to Morton's private train, unaware that Harmonica is following him. Morton scolds him for coming there, but Wobbles says he wasn't followed, and he thought Morton and Frank would want to know about Mrs. McBain. When Frank sees Harmonica's shadow on the ground, he knows someone is on the roof, and he signals the train to start moving.Stopping in open country, Frank captures Harmonica. A blurry flashback appears of an indistinct man walking through a desert landscape, but no explanation is given). Frank has Harmonica brought on board and bound. He kicks Wobbles off the train (literally) and shoots him down just as Wobbles is about to reveal the presence of Cheyenne hiding in the train's undercarriage. Harmonica lets Frank know that the two men he sent to kill Jill are themselves dead. Realizing this is the man who wanted to meet with him, Frank asks Harmonica who he is. Harmonica answers with the names of two men Frank has killed. Morton interrupts the interrogation to remind Frank he has more urgent business: the woman. Taking to horseback, Frank rides away with three of his men to do away with Mrs. McBain himself. He leaves three men behind on the train to guard Harmonica and keep an eye on Morton, whom he doesn't trust. Frank tells the men to meet him at the Navajo cliff, and the train gets under way again. Over the next few minutes, Cheyenne craftily disposes of the three gunmen one by one and sets Harmonica free. They now have Morton in their power, but they will deal with him later, choosing to stop the train and ride to Jill's aid.At Sweetwater, Jill is puzzled by the arrival of a large amount of lumber and building supplies that McBain ordered. Since he paid cash, it all belongs to her. Neither the lumberman nor Sam can say what it's for, but there are enough materials to build at least eight buildings. When the lumberman shows her a blank sign and asks if she knows what should go on it, she recognizes its outline from the miniature train station and tells him it should say ""STATION."" Inside the house, she looks through the trunk again for the model train station. Just then, Frank captures her.At the Navajo cliff, Morton offers to buy Sweetwater to avoid more killing--he's had enough of Frank's butcher tactics. He doesn't have time to compete with Frank. But away from his train, Morton looks weak and pathetic, no competition at all as far as Frank is concerned. Frank kicks one of his crutches out from under him, sending Morton sprawling face first: ""I could squash you like a wormy apple."" Frank tells some of his men to take Morton back to his train and watch him.At Sweetwater, Cheyenne and his men are just as puzzled by the building supplies as Jill was. Harmonica paces off the dimensions of a train station while explaining to Cheyenne what he has seen in a document: McBain was planning to build a town at Sweetwater, which has the only water supply for fifty miles west of Flagstone. Since trains need lots of water to make steam, the railroad must inevitably come through Sweetwater. McBain contracted for the rights to operate the depot himself, provided it was built by the time the tracks reached it. Knowing that the rail gangs are just over the hill, Cheyenne puts his men to work building the station.Inside a ruin at the Navajo cliff, Frank enjoys an intimate interlude with his captive Jill. He remarks that she will do anything to stay alive and that it seems she can't resist a man's touch, even the touch of the man who killed her husband. Frank knows from inquiries sent over the telegraph that Jill was one of the most popular prostitutes in New Orleans until she married McBain. As he undresses her, he thinks of marrying her himself to take over the land. Realizing he would make a bad husband, he comes up with a quicker, simpler solution.Jill sits in quiet resignation in the saloon at Flagstone, where people have gathered for a land auction. One of Frank's men hovers over her, and several more are scattered through the crowd, ready to intimidate anyone who even starts to make a bid. It's Frank's way of getting the property for himself cheaply. The sheriff (Keenan Wynn) reluctantly gets the auction under way.Meanwhile Morton, aboard his train, senses that his dream of seeing the Pacific is growing remote. He joins a game of poker with four of Frank's men who are now his captors. Instead of dealing out cards, he deals out five hundred dollars to each of the men to buy their allegiance to him.Back at the land auction, one of Frank's still-loyal men bids five hundred dollars for the farm. Just as the sheriff is about to close the sale, Harmonica calls out a bid of five thousand dollars. In what is most likely a scheme devised by both men, Harmonica brings in an indignant Cheyenne at gunpoint and turns him in for the reward money to cover his bid. The sheriff puts Cheyenne under guard on the train bound to Yuma, where there is a new, strong, modern prison that is much more secure than the local jail. But two of Cheyenne's men follow him onto the train after buying one-way tickets to the next station. Meanwhile, one of the men on Morton's train rides into town to tell the others what transpired in the poker game.Jill is grateful that Harmonica has saved the farm for her, and she begins to look at him more warmly. Frank enters the saloon and offers Harmonica five thousand dollars for the farm, plus one silver dollar profit. Again he asks Harmonica's name, and Harmonica answers with the names of two more dead men: ""They were all alive until they met you, Frank."" Again the blurred flashback appears, but the image of Frank walking through the desert becomes clearer than before. Harmonica rejects the offer but uses Frank's silver dollar to pay for his drink. Having noticed suspicious activity outside, Harmonica goes to watch from the upstairs windows and balcony, breaking into the room where Jill is taking a steamy bath. Frank steps out of the saloon onto the street--and into a deadly cat-and-mouse game. His former men, now Morton's men, try to gun him down. But with some timely assistance from Harmonica, Frank manages to kill them instead and rides out. Jill is furious at Harmonica for saving Frank's life. He tells her, ""I didn't let them kill him and that's not the same thing.""Frank discovers the aftermath of a gun battle at Morton's train. Bodies of Frank's men and Cheyenne's men lie strewn along the tracks and in Morton's private car. He finds Morton crawling desperately to a nearby mud puddle. Frank draws and cocks his gun to finish him off but then decides to let him suffer. Morton dies with the sound of ocean waves crashing in his mind.The track laying crew is reaching Sweetwater at last, and construction crew are busily turning the stacks of lumber into the beginnings of a town. Harmonica sits at the farmyard gate as Cheyenne comes riding awkwardly in and goes inside. Not quite his usual self, he again asks for coffee, which Jill has ready this time. They both sense that outside something important is about to happen with Harmonica. Cheyenne: ""He's whittlin' on a piece of wood. I got a feelin' when he stops whittlin', somethin's gonna happen.""Frank rides up to the gate, and Harmonica stops whittling. They exchange a few words. Frank admits he'll never be a businessman: ""Just a man."" They acknowledge they're of an ancient race being killed off by the coming of the modern age--arriving right next to them as they speak. Then Frank gets to the business between them: ""The future don't matter to us. Nothin' matters now--not the land, not the money, not the woman. I came here to see you. 'Cause I know that now you'll tell me what you're after.""""Only at the point of dyin',"" Harmonica tells him. Frank says, ""I know,"" and they stride out into the farmyard to face off for the final showdown.Inside, Cheyenne begins to clean up and shave while he watches the railroad move up. He tells Jill she should take water out to the workers at the tracks, letting them enjoy the sight of a beautiful woman. And if one of them should pat her behind, she should just make believe it's nothing. They earned it.As Frank and Harmonica square up a few feet apart, preparing to duel, Harmonica remembers his history with Frank, in the flashback, a young Frank strides out of the desert to the isolated ruin of a Spanish mission--a lone arch with a bell hanging at the top. He places a brand-new harmonica into a young man's mouth, telling him to keep his lovin' brother happy. The youth's hands are bound behind him, and his older brother, also bound, is standing on his shoulders with a noose around his neck. Frank and his men wait for the inevitable moment when the boy's legs will give way and complete the hanging. The doomed man curses Frank and kicks his younger brother away. The harmonica drops out of the young man's mouth as he falls into the dust.Frank and Harmonica draw and shoot. Frank turns around and staggers a few steps before he falls to the his knees. He asks Harmonica again, ""Who ... who are you?"" In answer, Harmonica places the old, beaten-up harmonica into Frank's mouth. Frank's remembers--he sees the image of the boy falling into the dust and the harmonica dropping out of his mouth. Frank falls lifelessly into the dust and the harmonica drops out of his mouth.Cheyenne tells Jill he's not the right man for her, but neither is Harmonica. There's something inside a man like that, he tells her, something to do with death. Once Harmonica has dealt with Frank, he will come inside, pick up his things and move on.Harmonica comes in and, true to Cheyenne's prediction, picks up his belongings and tells Jill he has to go. Jill is wearing a dress whose top reveals her cleavage. They share a lingering look, and then he opens the front door and surveys the developing street scene outside. ""It's going to be a beautiful town, Sweetwater,"" he says. Jill hopes he will come back someday. With a doubtful ""Someday,"" Harmonica leaves. Cheyenne too says goodbye and pats Jill on the behind, telling her to make believe it's nothing.As the two men ride away, Cheyenne pauses and gets off his horse before dropping to the ground. Harmonica discovers that Cheyenne has been gut-shot, the work of Morton himself during the gun battle at the train. Cheyenne asks Harmonica to go away--he doesn't want Harmonica to see him die. Harmonica turns away and soon hears Cheyenne fall over dead. Just then, the work train rolls into Sweetwater and stops at the station, which has its ""STATION"" sign in place. Harmonica takes Cheyenne's body away as Jill carries water out to the newly arrived railroad workers.","

    Synopsis
    In the desert Southwest of America during the waning days of the Old West, three gunmen (Jack Elam, Woody Strode, Al Mulock) approach an isolated train depot; two are wearing duster overcoats. The men take over the station and settle in to wait for the train. When the train finally comes, a nameless harmonica-playing stranger (Charles Bronson) gets off and asks for someone named Frank. They tell him Frank sent them in his place. In the ensuing showdown, all four men go down. Only the man with the harmonica gets up again.The soundtrack to the opening scene is a creative orchestration of ordinary sounds in the style of John Cage. Composer Ennio Morricone uses dripping water, the clicking of a telegraph, a buzzing fly, and over all the persistent, annoying squeak of a windmill-powered pump to build tension, punctuate visual jokes, and emphasize the tedium of waiting for the train. The scant dialog allows the soundtrack to consume much more of our attention than a score usually does.On a remote farm called Sweetwater, Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his children are preparing an outdoor wedding feast. McBain tells his son Patrick to drive into town to pick up his new mother, who is arriving by train from New Orleans. Suddenly shots ring out from the desert, and McBain's daughter Maureen, son Patrick, and McBain himself are slain. The youngest McBain, Timmy, runs out of the house to find that his entire family has been destroyed. He watches in terrified silence as a group of five gunmen in duster overcoats emerge from the scrub brush. When one of the men calls their leader Frank by name, asking what to do with the child, Frank (Henry Fonda) draws his pistol and slowly takes aim at the last remaining witness. With a self-satisfied grin, he pulls the trigger.In the town of Flagstone, McBain's bride Jill (Claudia Cardinale) steps down from the train to find that no one is there to meet her. Giving up hope, she steps through the train station into the bustling new town still being built. She hires a carriage to drive her to Sweetwater. The farm's name draws laughter from the driver, Sam (Paolo Stoppa), who informs her that ""Sweetwater"" is a worthless piece of ground, and McBain is crazy for trying to farm it.Along the way, Sam speeds through a group of railroad workers busily laying their ""damn rails."" Then he stops at a wayside inn/tavern/trading post, and Jill follows him inside. Her beauty draws the unwelcome attentions of the barman (Lionel Stander). After a noisy off-screen gun battle, the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) enters wearing shackles on his wrists. The sounds of a harmonica again reveals the presence of the nameless stranger, who has been watching from a dark corner of the tavern. Cheyenne dubs him ""Harmonica,"" and he uses Harmonica's gun to force another patron to shoot apart the chain between his wrists. Cheyenne's men soon arrive, too late to help him escape the prison guards who now lie dead outside. Harmonica notes that the three men he killed earlier were wearing the same duster overcoats as Cheyenne's men, and Cheyenne is annoyed that rivals may be copying his trademark dusters.Jill and Sam arrive at Sweetwater to find a crowd of somber wedding guests standing around the outdoor tables, now put to use as funeral biers. Jill is horrified at the carnage. When one of the women bemoans that this should happen to the ""poor little miss"" on her wedding day, Jill informs the guests that she and Brett McBain were married a month earlier in New Orleans. As the burial comes to an end, the crowd discovers that the torn-off collar of a duster overcoat was found on a nail by the door. This marks the massacre as Cheyenne's work. The men form a posse and ride off to track down the outlaw and hang him. Sam offers to drive Jill back to Flagstone, but she says she will stay at Sweetwater. That evening, she ransacks the McBain household, looking for anything of value that might have been hidden away.At the town laundry in Flagstone that night, Harmonica puts the laundry man Wobbles through a violent interrogation, wanting to know why Frank didn't show up at the train. Wobbles doesn't know; he only arranged the meeting. Harmonica suspects Frank was occupied at McBain's farm just then, but Wobbles insists otherwise: ""Cheyenne did that job--everyone knows that. We got proof."" Harmonica doesn't believe it: ""That was always one of Frank's tricks--fakin' evidence.""Jill finds a group of miniature buildings stored away in a trunk, including a model train station with a fancy swinging sign that says ""STATION."" She hears the sound of a harmonica outside and fires a shotgun into the darkness. The sound of the harmonica moves farther away. In the morning as she is about to leave for good, she finds Cheyenne on her doorstep. While his men wait outside, he barges in and asks for coffee. He tells of being chased by the posse all night and helps make the fire for the coffee. He says he would never kill a kid: ""I ain't the mean bastard people make out."" He decided to come take a look at the scene of his supposed crime. Not only is he annoyed that someone is trying to blame him, but neither he nor Jill can understand why the killings happened at all. The place looks so worthless, he imagines that McBain must have hidden a treasure away somewhere. Jill tells him that if so, she couldn't find it. Aware that she is vulnerable to any sort of mistreatment Cheyenne and his men might deal out, she serves the coffee.In a private railroad car, Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti), a crippled and dying railroad tycoon, berates Frank for killing the McBains. He only wanted Frank to scare McBain, not kill him. And now a Mrs. McBain has shown up, making the killings pointless. Morton began building his railroad in sight of the Atlantic Ocean, and he means to build his way to the Pacific before he dies. He hired Frank to ""remove small obstacles from the tracks,"" but Frank intends to become a wealthy businessman himself. Morton tells Frank he will never be like Morton, because Frank doesn't understand that money is more powerful than guns.After sharing a congenial interlude with Jill, Cheyenne finishes his coffee and rides away with his men. Jill takes her traveling bags out to the wagon. But Harmonica is there and demands that she stay. As he throws her down roughly and begins ripping at her clothes, Jill becomes alarmed. Instead of harming her, he simply removes the white trimmings from her black dress, leaving her in full mourning. They go to the well for a drink of water, only to be attacked by two more of Frank's men. Harmonica kills them, and from a nearby vantage point Cheyenne sees how handy Harmonica is with a gun.Jill goes to the laundry and asks Wobbles to tell Frank she knows everything and wants to negotiate with Frank personally. Wobbles denies knowing anyone named Frank, but Jill repeats her demand and leaves. Wobbles heads out to Morton's private train, unaware that Harmonica is following him. Morton scolds him for coming there, but Wobbles says he wasn't followed, and he thought Morton and Frank would want to know about Mrs. McBain. When Frank sees Harmonica's shadow on the ground, he knows someone is on the roof, and he signals the train to start moving.Stopping in open country, Frank captures Harmonica. A blurry flashback appears of an indistinct man walking through a desert landscape, but no explanation is given). Frank has Harmonica brought on board and bound. He kicks Wobbles off the train (literally) and shoots him down just as Wobbles is about to reveal the presence of Cheyenne hiding in the train's undercarriage. Harmonica lets Frank know that the two men he sent to kill Jill are themselves dead. Realizing this is the man who wanted to meet with him, Frank asks Harmonica who he is. Harmonica answers with the names of two men Frank has killed. Morton interrupts the interrogation to remind Frank he has more urgent business: the woman. Taking to horseback, Frank rides away with three of his men to do away with Mrs. McBain himself. He leaves three men behind on the train to guard Harmonica and keep an eye on Morton, whom he doesn't trust. Frank tells the men to meet him at the Navajo cliff, and the train gets under way again. Over the next few minutes, Cheyenne craftily disposes of the three gunmen one by one and sets Harmonica free.

Frank kicks one of his crutches out from under him, sending Morton sprawling face first: ""I could squash you like a wormy apple.""

"8","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062765/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","It is a Friday night in April 1968 in Chicago. Johnny Ross works with his brother Pete; both are involved with organized crime, and the mob is after Johnny Ross because he siphoned off $2 million of their money. Johnny escapes a mass of gunmen outside his office, then greets Pete in the garage of their office building. The two exchange brotherly greetings and go on their way - Johnny drives past yet another attempt on his life while Pete telephones his higher-up and tells them that Johnny escaped.Saturday afternoon in San Francisco. A man goes to a hotel and asks the desk clerk for a message for ""Johnny Ross"", and seems surprised that no message is there. The man takes a cab and has the driver stop by a phone booth, where the man makes a pair of calls, one of them long-distance. At that point, Sgt. Don Delgetti of the SFPD awakens his partner, Detective Lt. Frank Bullitt, at his apartment. Bullitt has been trying to get some sleep after a case that stretched to 5 AM that morning and grumpily chats with his partner.After showering and getting dressed, Frank Bullitt is driven by Delgetti and another policeman, Sgt. Carl Stanton, to the plush mansion of politician Walter Chalmers, who is entertaining a vast pool of guests at a function. Chalmers tells Frank of a star witness who will testify against the mob - Johnny Ross - and who needs protection through his appearance to testify on Monday morning. Chalmers clearly hopes to use Ross as well as Bullitt to the benefit of his political career, and leaves Frank and his two partners to guard Ross at the Hotel Daniels, a flophouse near an passing highway.Frank, Delgetti, and Stanton meet the man who had inquired about a Johnny Ross letter, and the man is puzzled about Chalmers putting him up in such a cheap hotel. After phoning his boss, Captain Samuel Bennett, Frank arranges three shifts to guard Ross, with Delgetti going first, then Stanton, then Bullitt.Around 1am the following morning Stanton gets a call from the Hotel Daniels front desk claiming that Chalmers and a friend want to see them. Stanton has the two men wait, then calls Frank, who realizes something is wrong and rushes to the Hotel Daniels. Stanton then notices the door to their room is unlocked, just as the two men - a 5' 10"" white-haired shotgun killer and his back-up man - kick the door open and shoot both he and Ross.Delgetti and ambulances arrive before Frank does, and Frank accompanies Stanton in the ambulance ride to the hospital, where the injured officer describes the gunman, identifies the gun brand (a Winchester pump-action shotgun), and relates that Ross unlocked the door, to the puzzlement of Frank.Captain Bennett arrives at the hospital after getting a report on the hotel from the SFPD crime lab, and after getting what he can from Frank warns him that Chalmers is livid upon learning of this fiasco and will try to lay the blame on the department in general and Bullitt in particular. For his part, Bullitt is ready when Chalmers arrives and questions him; Chalmers demands to know how Bullitt fouled up the protection detail and Frank pointedly asks Chalmers about Chalmers' deal with Ross, but the oily politician vows to ruin Frank's career if Ross dies - even to the point of requesting a different doctor be assigned to Ross.A white-haired man - the shotgun killer - appears at the hospital and asks a doctor about a friend of his with a gunshot wound; the doctor tells him that it might be the man on the second floor (Ross), then phones Bullitt. Frank has a policeman guard Ross' room, and when a nurse catches the shotgun killer untaping an icepick from his leg, Frank chases him through the hospital. Bullitt nearly corners the man in the physical therapy wing in the basement, but the killer eludes him and escapes.More bad news arrives when Ross suddenly goes into respiratory failure and dies. Frank tells the doctor not to confirm Ross' death, as Chalmers will ruin them both. Bullitt also believes that the killers, upon knowing they've succeeded, will disappear; the doctor agrees to misplace Ross' files and Frank has Delgetti take Ross' body under the name John Doe to the coroner's office.While Frank goes home to shower and get some rest, Chalmers, accompanied by a posse of assistants and police Captain Baker, arrives at the hospital and immediately demands to know Ross' location. The supervising nurse tells Chalmers that Ross' file has been misplaced. He telephones Bullitt and gets the runaround, and tells Baker to punish Bullitt for the mishap.Frank and Delgetti, meanwhile, question the Hotel Daniels desk clerk -- he'd been hit & knocked unconscious by the killers. They get a description of the cab Ross arrived in as well as a description of the driver; Frank deduces who drove Ross and rides with the cabbie in question and learns about Ross' phone calls -- the cabbie has a sharp recollection of Ross' stops during the ride & is able to point out that Ross had made a long distance phone call at a phone booth. Frank telephones Eddy, an informant, and they arrange a meeting near Enrico's restaurant, where Eddy tells Frank about the mob's pursuit of Ross and what they're after him for.Chalmers, meanwhile, intercepts Captain Bennett while he and his family are going to mass and serves him with a legal writ, duly witnessed by two of Chalmers' aides-de-camp, requiring Bennett to turn in Ross by Monday morning.After being dropped off at his own car at the cabbie's garage - a Ford Mustang - Frank notices that a black Dodge Charger has been following him around the city. He drives around some of the hilly side streets and eludes his pursuers enough to become the pursuer himself. The two mob assassins, realizing they've been outmaneuvered, make a break and a mad high-speed pursuit ensues through the hills of the city and eventually spilling onto a two-lane freeway. The shotgun man finally opens fire on Frank but Frank rams his Mustang into the Charger as they approach a gas station/repair shop; the Charger flies off the road, plows through the gas station, and explodes as pumps are sheared off, killing both gunmen.Frank and Delgetti are now angrily questioned by Bennett and Baker and Frank reveals Ross' death, and that a check of phone records shows that Ross called a woman, Dorothy Simmons, staying in a San Mateo hotel hours before his death. Bennett holds the legal writ until Monday morning, giving Frank one day to prove the two men killed in the gas station were Ross' killers. He is driven to the San Mateo hotel, but he finds the woman dead, and later a search of their luggage reveals that she had a man with her and that both of them had books of travelers checks worth tens of thousands of dollars; moreover, the woman is not Dorothy Simmons but Dorothy Renick, and the man she is with is her husband Albert.Delgetti calls Chicago to fax passport information to the SFPD while Frank gets a fingerprint check on Ross at the coroner's office. The fax printout comes through and Bullitt shows that Chalmers had the wrong man the whole time. Frank and Delgetti now must comb the San Francisco Airport to find the real Ross while Chalmers, determined to take in the real Ross himself, follows. Renick was originally booked on a flight to Rome, however, after he arrives at the airport, he switches to a flight to London. Frank, going on a hunch when Renick doesn't show at the Rome check-in, manages to stop the plane Ross is on before departing, and identifies Ross by his expression and actions. Ross jumps off the plane and runs across the runway, with Frank pursuing. Ross runs back into the terminal as Delgetti arrives with a security guard. Trapped between two automatic doors, Ross tries to shoot his way out, but Frank kills him. Chalmers leaves, disgusted that he's lost his star witness.Frank returns home, where his girlfriend is sleeping, and starts to wash his hands. She had earlier expressed fear that he was becoming as inhuman in his own way as the criminals he pursues - and now he wonders if she may be right.","
    
                    High profile San Francisco Police Lieutenant Frank Bullitt is asked personally by ambitious Walter Chalmers, who is in town to hold a US Senate subcommittee hearing on organized crime, to guard Johnny Ross, a Chicago based mobster who is about to turn evidence against the organization at the hearing. Chalmers wants Ross' safety at all cost, or else Bullitt will pay the consequences. Bullitt and his team of Sergeant Delgetti and Detective Carl Stanton have Ross in protective custody for 48 hours over the weekend until Ross provides his testimony that upcoming Monday. Bullitt's immediate superior, Captain Samuel Bennet, gives Bullitt full authority to lead the case, no questions asked for any move Bullitt makes. When an incident occurs early during their watch, Bullitt is certain that Ross and/or Chalmers are not telling them the full story to protect Ross properly. Without telling Bennet or an incensed Chalmers, Bullitt clandestinely moves Ross while he tries to find out who is after Ross, and why Ross has seemingly made it so easy for ""them"" to find him. As Bullitt enlists the help of his live-in artist girlfriend Cathy over the weekend and as she sees for the first time with what he deals every day, she wonders if he is indeed the man with whom she should be.

"10","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062861/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In a nameless European country, Inspector Ginco (Michel Piccoli) takes every precaution to ensure that a $1,000,000 shipment of money reaches a local bank. Despite having decoy armored trucks, the real one containing the money is sidetracked to a marina where a masked career thief, known only as Diabolik (John Phillip Law) steals the whole truck by lifting up by an electric magnet and dropping it into the water, where he dives in and retrieves the money. In a long chase, Diabolik eludes the police by switching cars with his mistress and partner-in-crime, Eva Kant (Marisa Mell) who drives Diabolik back to his hideout, a remote cave in a mountain side which has miles of underground passageways, and their living quarters is a mod of various expensive designed bought with their ill gotten money.Having heard of the latest robbery by the masked thief, the Minister of the Interior (Terry Thomas) arranges for a press conference. But Diabolik and Eva sneak into the conference disgused as reporters where, using their flash bulbs on their camera, they set off some 'exhilarating gas'. When the Minister informs the press of this latest theft and preaching to the reporters that he is not to be made a fool of, the Minister is reduced to just that when the gas reduces everyone in the room to hysterical laughter, while Diabolik and Eva quietly leave unnoticed.Following the press conference, Inspector Ginco attempts to resign. But his boss (Claudio Gora) refuses to accept his resignation. Ginco reluctantly agrees to stay on the police force, and is subsequently put in charge of the current plan to put all criminals behind bars. With tireless precision, Ginco and his men clean up the city. Mobsters are put behind bars, and then executed. When a drug den is raided, the jaded hippies and drug addicted are carted off.Ralph Valmont (Adolfo Celi), the head of a large crime syndicate which is responsible for most of the murders and drug trafficking in the country, learns about the raid on one of his establishments, and makes contact with Inspector Ginco. In exchange for his life, Valmont promises to help Ginco capture Diabolik.When the visiting British finance minister and his wife are honored at a gala party in a large castle by the beach, the press, encouraged by Ginco, play up the wifes recent acquisition of a rare emerald necklace, which is to be unveiled at the celebration. Ginco knows that Diabolik will not pass up the chance to steal the valuable jewelry, so he and his men lay in wait all around the castle for Diabolik to show up. Diabolik does show up, by scaling the seaside wall of the castle to the living quarters of the finance minister's wife where he steals the necklace, and makes another clever escape by constructing a makeshift catapult, but tricks Gino and the police into thinking he used it to eject himself to safety, when he really hides underneath it and simply walks out of the castle dressed as a policeman.Meanwhile, Valmont and henchmen recognize Eva at an Esso filling station, and they kidnap her. After making contact with Diabolik though a local newspaper, he promises to hand over the emerald necklace in exchange for Eva. Valmont wants to meet Diabolik aboard his private airplane. The following evening, Diabolik meets with Valmont's henchmen who herd him aboard Valmont's plane which takes off. But it is revealed that this is all part of Ginco's plan for once the plane reaches a destined spot, Valmont is to release a trap door on his plane which will literally drop Diabolik into the inspector's lap. But the plan backfires greatly when Diabolik figures out what is going on and in the subsequent shoot-out aboard the plane, Diabolik frees Eva, and he and Valmont stuggle in which they fall through the trapdoor, but Diabolik leaves behind a bomb which explodes, killing all of Valmont's henchmen. The three of them parachute to safely on the ground near the police rendezvous spot where in a continuation shoot-out, Diabolik kills Valmont by shooting him before apparently committing suicide when Ginco and the police close in on him.Ginco is saddened by Diabolik's death for he never got the chance to really arrest him. But Diabolik is not dead. During the shoot-out he took a drug which slowed down his heart and matabolsim to the point where he appeared dead. At the mourge, Eva, disguised as a nurse, arrives and administrates the antidote. Diabolik awakens, and kills the coroner before making his escape.Unaware of Diabolik's most recent escape, Gino is puzzled over the missing emeralds. Upon reading Valmont's death certificate, an idea puzzles him. All totaled, there are eleven emeralds missing. Valmont died form eleven bullet wounds. Ginco realizes that Diabolik is clever enough to use the jewels as bullets, therby proving a very safe hiding place for them. Ginco runs over to the crematorium to inspect Valmont's ashes. Diabolik, disguised as Valmont's elderly brother, has already arrived to lay claim to his brother's ashes. When the morgue attendant begins to scoop the ashes into a urn, he is shocked to find the emeralds. But before he can do anything, Diabolik knocks him out, and makes his escape with the emeralds. As usual, Ginco arrives at the morgue missing Diabolik by a matter of seconds.With no other alternatives open, the police offer a $1 million rewards to anybody to is able to lead them to Diabolik, Ginco realizes the foolishness of this plan, but his superiors refuse to listen him because of his string of bad luck in trying to catch Diabolik. Soon after, Diabolik sends a note to the government saying: ""in view of the bad use of the government is making of the public's money, I shall take steps to remove it from circulation."" In a matter of days, he blows up all tax offices, federal banks, and treasury buildings to smithereens. The former Minister of the Interior, now working as the Minister of Finance, makes another comic appearance on television where he reveals that with the destruction of the tax offices, the tax records of all citizens have been destroyed. He employs everybody to come forward voluntarily and pay the tax they think they owe. His speech elicts nothing but more laughter from the TV viewers.With the government now strapped for money, Ginco decides to put one last plan into action. He has the entire gold reserve melted down into a 20-ton ingot so that it can make up for the lost taxes. Yet he realizes that Diabolik is going to attempt to steal it too. Rather than be outwitted again, Ginco has the container of the gold partially 'radio activated'. In this way, once it is stolen, he will he able to use radioactive detectors to lead them to Diabolik's hideout, and leading him to all of Diabolik's stolen goods.The next day, the ingot is duly stolen by Diabolik who sabatoges the train carrying it by blowing up a railroad bridge, in which the railroad car containing the large ingot falls into the river. Diabolik and Eve, donning wet suites, then use inflatable underwater balloons to transport the large container though an underwater passage to their hideout.At Diabolik's hideout, he dons a protective heat suit and plans to melt down the gold into gold bricks.

For the first time, Diabolik is caught off-guard by the advancing police, but not entirely unprepared as he decides to flood the entire cavern therby destroying himself and everyone in it. But unaware that the ingot container is partly radioactive, Diabolik leaves his electric drill on the container in which the extreme heat from the drill makes the container glow red hot. Just as Diabolik is about to pull a lever to flood the cavern, the container explodes, showering him in molten gold.The police are finally delighted to have finally disposed of Diabolik, and allow reporters and the public into Diabolik's cave to put on display Diabolik. But Ginco is not at all pleased by the decision to display the body, which now is a picturesque gold statue for the general public.

                    In psychedelic swinging 60s style, the dreaded thief (and killer) Diabolik wreaks havoc on a generic European country for his own financial gain and amusement. He shares an extravagant underground lair (and a giant bed of money) with his curvaceous, superficial girlfriend...who uses her awesome powers of wig-wearing to help Diabolik kill innocent people and steal billions from the government. Nonetheless, Diabolik is the ""hero"" of the film because he must face off against bumbling cops and revenge-seeking mafiosos.

    Synopsis
    In a nameless European country, Inspector Ginco (Michel Piccoli) takes every precaution to ensure that a $1,000,000 shipment of money reaches a local bank. Despite having decoy armored trucks, the real one containing the money is sidetracked to a marina where a masked career thief, known only as Diabolik (John Phillip Law) steals the whole truck by lifting up by an electric magnet and dropping it into the water, where he dives in and retrieves the money. In a long chase, Diabolik eludes the police by switching cars with his mistress and partner-in-crime, Eva Kant (Marisa Mell) who drives Diabolik back to his hideout, a remote cave in a mountain side which has miles of underground passageways, and their living quarters is a mod of various expensive designed bought with their ill gotten money.Having heard of the latest robbery by the masked thief, the Minister of the Interior (Terry Thomas) arranges for a press conference. But Diabolik and Eva sneak into the conference disgused as reporters where, using their flash bulbs on their camera, they set off some 'exhilarating gas'. When the Minister informs the press of this latest theft and preaching to the reporters that he is not to be made a fool of, the Minister is reduced to just that when the gas reduces everyone in the room to hysterical laughter, while Diabolik and Eva quietly leave unnoticed.Following the press conference, Inspector Ginco attempts to resign. But his boss (Claudio Gora) refuses to accept his resignation. Ginco reluctantly agrees to stay on the police force, and is subsequently put in charge of the current plan to put all criminals behind bars. With tireless precision, Ginco and his men clean up the city. Mobsters are put behind bars, and then executed. When a drug den is raided, the jaded hippies and drug addicted are carted off.Ralph Valmont (Adolfo Celi), the head of a large crime syndicate which is responsible for most of the murders and drug trafficking in the country, learns about the raid on one of his establishments, and makes contact with Inspector Ginco. In exchange for his life, Valmont promises to help Ginco capture Diabolik.When the visiting British finance minister and his wife are honored at a gala party in a large castle by the beach, the press, encouraged by Ginco, play up the wifes recent acquisition of a rare emerald necklace, which is to be unveiled at the celebration. Ginco knows that Diabolik will not pass up the chance to steal the valuable jewelry, so he and his men lay in wait all around the castle for Diabolik to show up. Diabolik does show up, by scaling the seaside wall of the castle to the living quarters of the finance minister's wife where he steals the necklace, and makes another clever escape by constructing a makeshift catapult, but tricks Gino and the police into thinking he used it to eject himself to safety, when he really hides underneath it and simply walks out of the castle dressed as a policeman.Meanwhile, Valmont and henchmen recognize Eva at an Esso filling station, and they kidnap her. After making contact with Diabolik though a local newspaper, he promises to hand over the emerald necklace in exchange for Eva. Valmont wants to meet Diabolik aboard his private airplane. The following evening, Diabolik meets with Valmont's henchmen who herd him aboard Valmont's plane which takes off. But it is revealed that this is all part of Ginco's plan for once the plane reaches a destined spot, Valmont is to release a trap door on his plane which will literally drop Diabolik into the inspector's lap. But the plan backfires greatly when Diabolik figures out what is going on and in the subsequent shoot-out aboard the plane, Diabolik frees Eva, and he and Valmont stuggle in which they fall through the trapdoor, but Diabolik leaves behind a bomb which explodes, killing all of Valmont's henchmen. The three of them parachute to safely on the ground near the police rendezvous spot where in a continuation shoot-out, Diabolik kills Valmont by shooting him before apparently committing suicide when Ginco and the police close in on him.Ginco is saddened by Diabolik's death for he never got the chance to really arrest him. But Diabolik is not dead. During the shoot-out he took a drug which slowed down his heart and matabolsim to the point where he appeared dead. At the mourge, Eva, disguised as a nurse, arrives and administrates the antidote. Diabolik awakens, and kills the coroner before making his escape.Unaware of Diabolik's most recent escape, Gino is puzzled over the missing emeralds. Upon reading Valmont's death certificate, an idea puzzles him. All totaled, there are eleven emeralds missing. Valmont died form eleven bullet wounds. Ginco realizes that Diabolik is clever enough to use the jewels as bullets, therby proving a very safe hiding place for them. Ginco runs over to the crematorium to inspect Valmont's ashes. Diabolik, disguised as Valmont's elderly brother, has already arrived to lay claim to his brother's ashes. When the morgue attendant begins to scoop the ashes into a urn, he is shocked to find the emeralds. But before he can do anything, Diabolik knocks him out, and makes his escape with the emeralds. As usual, Ginco arrives at the morgue missing Diabolik by a matter of seconds.With no other alternatives open, the police offer a $1 million rewards to anybody to is able to lead them to Diabolik, Ginco realizes the foolishness of this plan, but his superiors refuse to listen him because of his string of bad luck in trying to catch Diabolik. Soon after, Diabolik sends a note to the government saying: ""in view of the bad use of the government is making of the public's money, I shall take steps to remove it from circulation."" In a matter of days, he blows up all tax offices, federal banks, and treasury buildings to smithereens. The former Minister of the Interior, now working as the Minister of Finance, makes another comic appearance on television where he reveals that with the destruction of the tax offices, the tax records of all citizens have been destroyed. He employs everybody to come forward voluntarily and pay the tax they think they owe. His speech elicts nothing but more laughter from the TV viewers.With the government now strapped for money, Ginco decides to put one last plan into action. He has the entire gold reserve melted down into a 20-ton ingot so that it can make up for the lost taxes. Yet he realizes that Diabolik is going to attempt to steal it too. Rather than be outwitted again, Ginco has the container of the gold partially 'radio activated'. In this way, once it is stolen, he will he able to use radioactive detectors to lead them to Diabolik's hideout, and leading him to all of Diabolik's stolen goods.The next day, the ingot is duly stolen by Diabolik who sabatoges the train carrying it by blowing up a railroad bridge, in which the railroad car containing the large ingot falls into the river. Diabolik and Eve, donning wet suites, then use inflatable underwater balloons to transport the large container though an underwater passage to their hideout.At Diabolik's hideout, he dons a protective heat suit and plans to melt down the gold into gold bricks.

A lone transport plane, in German Luftwaffe insignia, picks its way through the peaks of the Bavarian Alps by night. Inside, seven paratroopers, in German Fallschirmjaeger uniform, wait in grim silence for the jump signal. Among them is their leader, Major Smith (Richard Burton) and his junior officer, Lieutenant Schaeffer (Clint Eastwood). The others: Christiansen (Donald Houston), Barkely (Peter Barkworth), Thomas (William Squire), Mac Pherson (Neil Mc Carthy) and Harrod (Brook Williams) are enlisted men. In the silent tension, Major Smith ponders his mission briefing.Flashing back to headquarters in London, the Fallschirjaeger paratroops turn out to be a team of highly trained British MI6 agents (except for Shaeffer, who is on loan from the American OSS). Briefed by intelligence chief, Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern), and his executive officer, Colonel Turner (Patrick Wymark), the team's mission is to rescue a captured American, General Carnaby (Robert Beatty), an Allied planner for Operation Overlord (D-Day). The General's plane has been shot down, and he is being held prisoner at the Schloss Adler (Castle of Eagles), an impregnable mountain-top fortress that also serves as headquarters for the German Alpine Korps. The prisoner must be rescued before he can divulge any information about Operation Overlord.Back in the present, the plane reaches its drop zone and the seven commandos parachute into a snow-covered mountain wilderness. Unseen by any of the men, a mysterious woman, also in Fallschirmjaeger gear, emerges from the planes cargo compartment and jumps after them. Smith's team gathers on their landing zone, only to find that their radioman, Harrod, is missing. After a quick search, he is found dead, his neck apparently broken in the drop. However, Major Smith is suspicious. Though the radioman's neck is bruised, there are no logs or large rocks buried beneath the snow to account for such an injury. He keeps silent, however, about his misgivings, and the group carries on to shelter in a high Alpine farmhouse that remains unoccupied in winter.Once there, Smith claims he's forgotten the code books carried by the dead radioman and goes back out into the night to get them, but instead detours around to the barn where he meets the mystery woman from the plane, Mary (Mary Ure). They obviously know each other very well, and after an hour of her company, Smith returns to the farmhouse. A skeptical Lt. Schaffer sits there patiently waiting, cleaning his gun, He obviously doesn't believe a word of Smith's story, but says nothing.The next day, the team climbs over the next ridge in the mountains, and see the Schloss-Adler castle on a peak across the valley. Waiting until dusk, they descend and sneak into the village at the base of the mountain. Changing into Wermacht uniforms, they bluff their way into the village and enter an inn, listening for information on Gen. Carnaby. Smith has a coded exchange with the barmaid (who turns out to be a British agent as well), and shortly thereafter meets both her and Mary in the woodshed behind the inn. He explains that he's in a hurry to get into the castle above because the Germans don't really have an American General, but instead have an impersonator named Cartright Jones who knows nothing about the second front. Astonished, Mary can't believe they've gone to all this trouble to rescue an imposter, but Smith has no time for further explanations, and produces forged papers that will get Mary into the castle that night with a new job as a servant.Exiting the woodshed, Smith finds another member of his team murdered, laying in the snow behind a scout car. He rejoins Schaffer in the inn, who has had enough of Smith's deceptions, and demands to be told the real story behind this mission, or he's out. As Smith starts to explain, the SS bursts in, capturing Smith, Schaffer and the other three agents. Smith and Schaffer are driven away in a staff car, while the other three men are taken away for questioning. Mary meanwhile rides the cable car up to the castle and begins to make her preparations.A mile from the village, Schaffer and Smith manage to start a fight in the car and to kill the German soldiers. They hike back to the village, pick up their hidden gear, blow up a warehouse as a diversion, steal a motorcycle and drive back out of the village along the road to the airport. They install small bombs on the telephone poles along the road, and rig trip wires to snow-poles along the road edge. Returning once more to the village, they find their three fellow agents being led into the cable car for a trip up to the castle, and make their way quickly up onto the roof of the terminal. As the car pulls out, Smith and Schaffer climb onto its roof, riding unseen up to the castle.After a harrowing ride on top of the cable car, they leap to the ledge above the terminal and claw their way up. Far above, Mary lowers a rope from a castle window, and they climb up the cliff face. Laying their final plans, Smith and Schaffer quietly make their way to the castle's great hall, where the Germans are talking to ""Carnaby"" over brandy and cigars. Since he politely but firmly refuses to tell them anything, they must regrettably resort to Scopolamine to get the information they want. The three captured members of Smith's rescue team are also brought in, and it is revealed that they are really double agents, posing as British but working for the Germans. As they are about to inject the fake General with truth serum, Smith quietly walks up out of the shadows surprising everyone, and declares that the double agents are still lying. Smith himself is tracking them, and he is really working for SS Military Intelligence. Pointing his gun at an astonished Schaffer, Smith tells him to sit down and shut up.Smith goes on to prove his true loyalties to the German High Command, and manages to convince the three traitors that they have been trapped. Desperate to prove they are really on the same side, they write down all the info they have on Nazi agents working in England. Smith gathers this up and asks German Col. Kramer (Anton Diffring) to review it, then quietly signals Schaffer to get ready. ""Compare their notes with my original,"" he tells Kramer, handing him another notebook. Leafing through it, Kramer finds all the pages are blank, and is stunned by the realization that Smith had duped them all. He really is a British agent, and has tricked the Nazis into revealing their entire spy network in England.In the ensuing confusion, Smith and Schaffer (who tells Smith that he's ""about as confused as I ever hope to be"") battle their way back out of the castle and onto the cable car. Escaping back down to the village, they highjack a large bus and speed out of town with the Germans in hot pursuit. Tripping the bombs they'd laid ealier as they drive by, the telephone poles are blasted in half and fall to block the road. The Germans are slowed but not stopped, and use dynamite of their own to blast through the obstacles. The team manages to beat them to the airport, where the same plane that had flown them in now swoops down and lands, allowing them to clamber in and escape through a hail of gunfire.Taking a long sigh of relief, they sit back as they're met in the plane by the man who'd sent them on this mission, Col. Turner (Patrick Wymark), second in command of British Intelligence. As he reviews the list of agents in disbelief, as Smith calmly tells Turner that there's one name that isn't on the list: that of the top German agent in England, confirmed by Colonel Kramer back at the castle. He shows the note to Turner, who shoots an alarmed look back at Smith.""It's your own name Colonel,"" he says. ""Don't look so surprised.""Pointing a gun at Smith, Turner calmly tries to talk his way out, but cannot. When in desperation he pulls the trigger to shoot Smith, the gun doesn't fire; Smith had removed to firing pin before the mission. With no cards left to play and facing certain hanging, Turner, sweat beading on his forehead, calmly asks if there is an alternative.""Do you want it?"" asks Smith.Turner nods. He slowly gets up, walks to the door in the rear of the plane and opens it. Taking a last bitter look at Smith, he jumps to his death.""Is that it Major?"" asks Schaffer tiredly as he replaces the door.""Yes, that's it,"" replies Smith. He leans back in his seat and closes his eyes. The plane lumbers on through the night, returning to England.","
    
                    During WW2 a British aircraft is shot down and crashes in Nazi held territory. The Germans capture the only survivor, an American General, and take him to the nearest SS headquarters. Unknown to the Germans the General has full knowledge of the D-Day operation. The British decide that the General must not be allowed to divulge any details of the Normandy landing at all cost and order Major John Smith to lead a crack commando team to rescue him. Amongst the team is an American Ranger, Lieutenant Schaffer, who is puzzled by his inclusion in an all British operation. When one of the team dies after the parachute drop, Schaffer suspects that Smith's mission has a much more secret objective.

When in desperation he pulls the trigger to shoot Smith, the gun doesn't fire; Smith had removed to firing pin before the mission. With no cards left to play and facing certain hanging, Turner, sweat beading on his forehead, calmly asks if there is an alternative.""Do you want it?"" asks Smith.Turner nods. He slowly gets up, walks to the door in the rear of the plane and opens it. Taking a last bitter look at Smith, he jumps to his death.""Is that it Major?"" asks Schaffer tiredly as he replaces the door.""Yes, that's it,"" replies Smith. He leans back in his seat and closes his eyes. The plane lumbers on through the night, returning to England.

                    A band of vigilantes catch Jed Cooper and, incorrectly believing him guilty of cattle rustling and murder, hang him and leave him for dead. But he doesn't die. He returns to his former profession of lawman to hunt down his lynchers and bring them to justice.

                    Jed Cooper is accused by nine men of killing one of their neighbors and stealing his cattle. When he fails to convince them of his innocence, they hang him. Fortunately, there is a U.S. Marshal in the area and he saves Cooper, who is then brought to Fort Grant for trial. Eventually, it is discovered that the man Cooper bought the cattle from was, in fact, the killer. Cooper is released, but still wants to get the nine men who hung him. The judge warns Cooper about taking the law into his own hands, who responds by saying that he knows the law, being a former lawman. The judge then offers Cooper a job as a Marshal. Cooper, while in a town picking up a prisoner, discovers one of the nine men and kills him after he draws on Cooper. When he returns to Fort Grant, Cooper learns that another member of the mob has turned himself in after learning of Cooper's innocence. He provides Cooper with the names of the rest and Cooper leaves to round them up. On his way to bring in the lynchers, Cooper is sidetracked by a report of another rustling and murder. Upon finding the rustlers, one of whom was in the posse that lynched Cooper, the posse wants to lynch them, but Cooper insists that they need to be tried and is left to bring them in on his own. Following a difficult road back to Fort Grant, the remaining members of the posse that hung him try to buy him off, then decide that the only way they can live free is to finish the job and kill him.

                    While crossing a river with his cattle, the former marshal Jed Cooper is surrounded by nine men and accused of killing the rancher that owned the cattle. They leave Cooper hanging on a tree, but he is rescued by Marshal Dave Bliss and brought to Fort Smith to the court of Judge Adam Fenton. His innocence is proven and Judge Fenton invites Cooper to the position of deputy marshal to help him to implement the law in the large area. Cooper accepts the position and chases the vigilantes with the warrants of Judge Fenton. Meanwhile the leader of the lynchers, Captain Wilson, realizes that they have committed three mistakes: they returned the money Jed Cooper had paid for the cattle expecting to get rid off him; they hung an innocent man; and they did not complete their task.

                    In Victorian England, Oliver Twist is the name given by a workhouse warden to a boy born in the workhouse orphanage, Oliver's mother who died in childbirth and whose identity is unknown. Now an adolescent, Oliver, who has never felt loved or accepted, manages to escape from both the harsh workhouse and his equally harsh placements ""for sale"". Managing to make his way to London, Oliver, feeling accepted for the first time in his life, is welcomed into a group of other young boys, headed by the Artful Dodger, who ""make wallets"" under the direction of Fagin. What Oliver is initially unaware of is that they are really a band of pickpockets, Fagin who hides away whatever riches he is able to obtain for his own personal benefit. One of Fagin's associates is the violent Bill Sikes, whose girlfriend, Nancy, is devoted to him despite his abuse of her. Oliver looks to Nancy as his one true friend, especially needed when he discovers what Fagin and the boys actually do. Oliver also comes to the attention of the wealthy Mr. Brownlow. Out of circumstance, Bill sees Oliver as both an asset and a liability, but one that needs to be kept enslaved under his direction. Nancy has to decide whether to be loyal to Bill to help him keep Oliver, or do what is best for Oliver by helping him escape, especially as she knows that Brownlow is looking for Oliver when he learns of Oliver's true heritage.

Bakshi continues about the party where he is mistakenly found, and explores the gadgets and gimmicks while making friends with several wonderful (albeit stereotyped) characters.Notably, he alienates the director from his earlier acting attempt when he rescues a lady from the director's unwanted amorous approaches. Our unsung hero also makes allies with the children and the household pets while continuing to ""tear down the house.""The film starts slowly, almost yawningly, but bulids towards the climax at the end with the following ingredients: Soap, Russians, a swimming pool and an elephant. Throw in a little peace, love and plenty of booze and you get the picture!A riotous film, one of my all time favorites. It brought Sellers and Edwards together for their best (IMHO) collaboration.PS watch out for the classic 3 wheeler Morgan sports car at the end - fits Peter Sellers' persona perfectly.

                    It's Christmas 1183, and King Henry II is planning to announce his successor to the throne. The jockeying for the crown, though, is complex.

                    Christmas 1183--an aging and conniving King Henry II plans a reunion where he hopes to name his successor. He summons the following people for the holiday: his scheming but imprisoned wife, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine; his mistress, Princess Alais, whom he wishes to marry; his three sons (Richard, Geoffrey, and John), all of whom desire the throne; and the young but crafty King Philip of France (who is also Alais' brother). With the fate of Henry's empire at stake, everybody engages in their own brand of deception and treachery to stake their claim.

                    Henry the II and Eleanor meet with their three surviving sons at Christmas to decide which of them should become the new king after Henry's death. Originally a stage play, the action is mostly in the speeches the people make. Each of the sons has some flaw that makes the decision difficult, but the pair have spent their lives fighting for position and even at the end can't possibly stop.

Philip is insisting Alais now marries John as agreed years before else he wants her dowry, the lands of the Vexen, back. As Eleanor has already given the province of Aquitaine to Richard, the outcome of this may decide the very future of England. Everyone present except perhaps Alais are masters of double-dealing and deceit, so it could be a lively Yuletide.

He softly knocks on the door of a room, but waits with the jitterbug in his stomach when one of the cleaning ladies appears, and he won't do anything else until she has gone away to her duties. When he finally enters the room, a strong light hits his face, so he can't look who he's talking to. The man tells him to give a piece of information some time down the line in exchange of 50,000 dollars due in small installments. The man throws him a pocket full of money in order to buy a new car, which he can't use until he's told so. It's a specific kind of car, with wood and red-coloured.Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) is a banker who deals with bonus portfolios. He's successful. However, under the name of Charlie, he phones to the public phone booths at a train station, checking that all his men (Richard Bull and Yaphet Kotto) are on their places. Suddenly, he decides it's time to move on. A black man kidnaps a lift full of people, including the bellboy (Charles Lampkin and Paul Verdier). An executive family including the talkative executive woman (Patty Regan) is waiting for the lift. A man who says that his name is Michael Holland points his gun to the booth guard (James Rawley). More people appear are they are told to step into the lift and stay there. One of the criminals shoots one of the people, a man who has started to get nervous because of the situation. Another accomplicce is told to dress as a policeman and create a traffic jam outside the bank. The objective consists on several money bags which are being transported from the hotel via the lift to somewhere else at a fixed time.The detective-looking man takes the car to a cemetery, where he has to leave a message - in a particular rubbish bin. He's sweating like a pig, and taking the sweat off with a huge white handkerchief. Right after the detective-looking man leaves, Thomas Crown appears in another car, a black Rolls Royce. He puts on some gloves, takes a funeral garland from the car and puts it at some random tomb. He gets next to the rubbish bin and takes the sacks - supposedly full of money - from it. He gets frantic when the bells start to ring, but then leaves off.Back home, his butler, John (John Orchard), asks him whether he's had a good day, and Thomas says it's been a really good day. He gives John a day off.Back at the police station, Eddy Malone (Paul Burke) is questioning the people at the bank. They are all talking at the same time. The bank didn't write the numbers of the notes because they were notes of small quantity. The police artist (Nikita Knatz) produces a sketch of one of the men, but it could be almost any male in the universe. The wounded man is OK, there are not fingertips at all, and the red duster the criminals used used to belong to the Army. Thomas phones a woman called Gwen (Astrid Heeren) to invite her to dine out at a restaurant.The detective-looking man has his car registered with a random search by a Boston police officer (Ed T. McDonnell) but he's not really a suspect. He pretends to be a door-to-door salesman who is going to sell his products in Portland and is going to stay at the Portland Motel. Meanwhile, Thomas Crown flies to Geneva, with nothing to declare at customs. Once there, Thomas opens up a bank account full of money. In a Swiss bank, the banker (Michael Shillo) opens up the account even though he realizes that there's something fishy with that account.Thomas Crown wants his money operations to be dated always on a 19th day. Jamie (Gordon Pinsent) is frustrated because the bank he works for has absolutely been jeopardized by such a loss, as his insurance company had to give 2,000,000 dollars to the bank to compensate them for such a loss. Jamie decides to call on Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway). Eddy and Jamie pick her up at the airport. Vicki is an independent insurance investigator, which makes her living collecting a huge fee after returning the money back to its legitimate owners. She's supposed to be ruthless and excellent at her job.Meanwhile, Thomas Crown is playing golf - a game at which he excels. People there respect him and call him Tommy. He likes important bets.Eddy checks the backgrounds of the customers and workers in the back and the hotel, but nothing is found. Vicki says that it's important to understand the personality of the crime, which reflects the personality of the criminal. She also says that she'll earn 10% of the money she recovers. The total amount stolen was 2,600,000. Thomas Crown is chilling out and flying his own airplane. His girlfriend worries about his careless manouvers.Vicki realises that the accomplices didn't know each other before, so that they didn't know their boss as well. She wants to place an ad asking for somebody to come forward and claim the money. Checking all high-earning bank workers, Vicki pays attention to Thomas Crown, who only worked for six months - years ago- at the bank. His luxiurious appearance calls her attention. She records him playing polo, and she feels that he's her man.Tommy and his friend Sandy (Biff McGuire) go to an auction. Thomas buys some lithographs which Vicki wanted, and then he gives them to Vicki. She tells him that she is investigating the bank robbery. In spite of that, he invites her to have dinner with him. Eddy doesn't understand why a man who has earned 4 million dollars is so eager to steal two more millions. Vicki thinks that the reason is emotion, a purpose.The wife of a Long Island salesman denounces her husband because of the 25,000 reward. Erwin Weaver (Jack Weston), the detective-looking man, uses 5,000 dollars paid by Thomas Crown to pay off the ransom of his son Jimmy Weaver (Leonard Caron). It was just a trick by Vicki and a disapproving Eddy, to make sure that Erwin has some unexplained extra money. Erwin talks, but he doesn't know much. Anyway, Vicki is not interested in him, but in Crown, as she will only collect her fee if she returns the money.Crown wonders at the announcement that the carpet at his exquisite mansion is being renovated. At that very moment, he was saying to Sandy that he's bored, so he may take off for a sabbatical year travelling around the world. He picks Vicki up, and Erwin is there. Eddy and Vicki ask Erwin if he recognises Crown. Vicki admits that Thomas Crown has won this fight. Vicki goes with him to his ""deserted old"" home. She makes a mental note of everything. While having some brandy, she wonders that it'd be a pity that he have to abandon it all. Vicki moves around as a lioness around her prey, and she stares at a chess game. When he asks her whether she can play, she dares him to play. So they play a game of chess. It's difficult for me to describe the faces of these two characters, their looks at each other, and the sexual tension which hovers over this game of chess. She is about to win, so he pulls her close and they kiss each other, suggesting that they play at ""something else"". They french kiss and it's implied that they make love.Vicki tells Eddy that she's caught Thomas. She is exultant thinking that he's about to fall on her trap. She goes on dating him. Eddy is outraged that she's using herself as a bait. Vicki wants to keep on investigating like that. She gives him a birthday present, a sign which says ""Think dirty"".Thomas Crown points to Vicki the men she's paying to follow him. She says that, lately, following him means also following her, and that she doesn't like it. Thomas gets rid of one of his followers, making him look like a drunk driver. That man was Danny (Patrick Horgan), from the Criminal Department.Vicki and Thomas keep on watching each other. She's getting nervous, because it's difficult to catch him. It looks like they are falling in love with each other. They even visit the tomb of the relative of Thomas. In the sauna, she tries to convince him that neither the insurance company nor the government will let him spend his money; he will have to run away for life. She convinces him to reach a deal with the government, but Eddy refuses, point blank. He says that he's got everything that he needs. Another day, in bed, he says that he can rob another bank, and tells her to stay clear, as a witness, while he tries to beat the system at its own game.Eddy complains that public funds are being used by Vicki to join the high life. That night, at a beach barbecue, he tells her that he's going to rob another night. He just wants her to wait for him at the meeting point. He tells her that he needs to know what side she's in. Vicki cries because he's testing her and she realises that.Cut to another bank which is also moving a lot of money from its headquarters. The method used is similar to the first robbery, although this time the powder used to create confusion is yellow. Vicki has told Eddy the meeting point. Somebody has left something at the rubbish bin in the cemetery. Vicki is nervous through their wait for Thomas Crown to appear. Eddy is getting impatient but Vicki reassures him. The same bell rings. A funeral car appears, at exactly the same time that Thomas' Rolls also drives on. The police jump at the Rolls. A telegram boy gives a note to Vicki.

Upon meeting, Anderson knows that Crown is the thief. Crown knows what Anderson believes as she tells him as much. Despite their positions, they are immediately attracted to each other and begin a relationship. But this does not stop their cat and mouse chase. However, the role of the cat and the role of the mouse are not always clear cut.

Beyond stage success, Fanny also wants a happy personal life, most specifically with the suave Nicky Arnstein, a gambler in every respect of the word. Fanny loves him and loves that he loves her despite her lack of traditional beauty, but she does not love that he comes in and goes out of her life based on his financial standing at any given time and his need to earn that quick buck by the next poker game or high stakes business deal as he feels he needs to play the traditional role of money maker in their relationship on his own terms.

The briefing at Gabriel Demonstration Area (named for SGT Jimmy Gabriel, the first ""Green Beret"" soldier killed in Vietnam), includes a demonstration and explanation of the whys and wherefores of participating in the Vietnam War.Skeptical civilians and journalists are told that multinational Communism is what the U.S. is fighting in Vietnam; proof: weapons and equipment, captured from North Vietnamese soldiers and Vietcong guerrillas, manufactured in the Soviet Union, Communist Czechoslovakia, and Communist China. Despite that, Beckworth remains skeptical about the value of intervening in Vietnam's civil war. When asked by Green Beret Colonel Mike Kirby (John Wayne) if he had ever been to Southeast Asia, reporter Beckworth replies that he had not, prompting a discourteous acknowledgement of his opinion. Realizing his ignorance, Beckworth decides to go in-country to report on what he finds there so he may better his argument that America needs to stop participating in this unwinnable war.Colonel Kirby is posted to South Vietnam with two handpicked A-Teams of Special Forces troopers. One A-Team is to replace a team at a basecamp working with South Vietnamese and Montagnard soldiers while the other A-Team is to form a counter guerrilla Mike force. While selecting his teams, Kirby intercepts a Spc. Petersen (Jim Hutton) from another unit who is scrounging supplies from Kirby's supply depot. Realizing Petersen's skills, Kirby promotes him and brings him onto his SF team. The A team includes Captain MacDaniel (Edward Faulkner), a replacement for Captain Coleman (Jason Evers), Lieutenant Sachs (Frank Koomen), a Savoy 8 team leader, Master Sergeant Muldoon (Aldo Ray), the senior NCO, Sergeant First Class ""Doc"" McGee (Raymond St. Jacques), the teams medical Sergeant, Sergeant First Class Kowalski (Mike Henry), the teams communications specialist, Sergeant Provo (Luke Askew), the team's heavy weapons specialist, Sergeant Watson (Eddy Donno), the teams Mortar crewman, and Sergeant Parks (Rudy Robbins), a man from the Southern United States.Arriving in South Vietnam, they meet Beckworth whom Kirby allows to join them at the base camp where he witnesses the humanitarian aspect (irrigation ditches, bandages, candy for children) of the Special Forces mission. Still, he remains skeptical of the U.S.'s need to be there.Meanwhile, Petersen befriends a young native boy named Ham Chuck (Craig Jue), a war orphan residing at the Special Forces camp who has no family other than his pet dog and the soldiers at the base camp.One night on Coleman's final night of his tour, he spends some time in the Team House, writing a letter, announcing of his return, Beckworth, and several of the A detachments, Sergeant's Provo, Watson, and Lark are playing cards, one member Parks cannot play in the game as his reputation for cons, and luck-playing was well known, Coleman instructs the men to check their guard duty rosters before they turn in to rest, he bids everyone good night and Coleman returns to his own sleeping quarters, not long afterwards, the camp begins to get hit with Viet Cong mortars in a harassment action, the mortar fire strikes the dispensary, ""communication bunker"" and the team house, however the team house is in flames when other soldiers hastened to check on Coleman whom was known to be inside at the time of the attack. However, MacDaniel dispersed nearby soldiers on various assignments to check if they're is any damage done with the communication bunker as well forming a reconnaissance patrol, however Coleman is found dead by Sergeant Provo and a soldier amidst the flaming debris, after Coleman's death MacDaniel informs Colonel Kirby of his demise, Provo observed the fact that Captain Coleman was due to return home the following day,Also introduced is the ARVN base camp strike force leader Captain Nim (George Takei), who was a former Viet Minh officer from Hanoi during the previous war and is now fighting for the anti-communist South Vietnamese government. He obsesses with having to ""kill all the stinking Viet Cong"" to win this war. He also claims that there is a spy network within the camp and ARVN strike force.One day, Sergeant Muldoon, while supervising a group of U.S. Seabees clearing part of the jungle around the base camp and evacuating the civilians in preparation for a potential Viet Cong attack, notices an ARVN soldier pacing unusually outside the team house and mess hall and slugs him out. Upon interrogation by Captain Nim, the ARVN soldier denies being a Viet Cong spy, until Nim discovers a silver cigarette lighter in the ARVN soldier's possession, which belonged to a Green Beret medical specialist, a friend of Kirby's, recently murdered by the VC. After Beckworth sees Nim beat and torture the Viet Cong suspect to get a confession from him, he confronts Kirby about it. The Colonel justifies the interrogation by telling Beckworth about the cigarette lighter the Viet Cong suspect had and how the VC are ruthless killers who deserve no protection of any kind in this new kind of war.Another few days later, Beckworth accompanies Kirby and his team on a patrol to a local village in the nearby mountains. It is here that Beckworth changes his mind about the American involvement in the Vietnam war after witnessing the aftermath of a Viet Cong terror attack on a nearby Montagnard village in which the young grand-daughter of the village Chief he had befriended earlier, as well as the Chief and most of the male villagers, are tortured and executed by the VC for cooperating with the Americans.Another evening or two later, the Special Forces camp is attacked in a massed nighttime attack by thousands of enemy Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops. Kirby and Muldoon fly out to assess the situation. Their helicopter is shot down by enemy fire, but they are soon rescued by a patrol where they secure a field as a LZ for US and ARVN reinforcements as a 'Mike Force' to aid the besieged camp.Meanwhile, the ferocious North Vietnamese Army attack upon the SF camp continues relentlessly. Beckworth is forced to take a rifle from a fallen ARVN sergeant and fights alongside the Green Berets as well as helping move the local villagers into the camp to protect them from the enemy onslaught.As the battle rages, Ham Chunk's pet dog is killed and the young boy tearfully buries his faithful companion. Symbolically, the boy uses the stick he had used to dig the dog's grave as the tombstone. He is found by Petersen who takes him to safety with the other refugees. As ARVN soldiers rush to their defensive positions, the stick is knocked away, leaving an unmarked grave.At this time, the perimeter of the camp is breached by enemy sappers who blow up holes in the barbed wire fences around the camp, and the Green Berets and ARVN soldiers are forced to fall back to the inner perimeter however though the battle costs the lives of Lieutenant Sachs, Sergeant Sooby, and many Americans and South Vietnamese troops and civilians are killed in the battle. Captain MacDaniel, (Seabee) Lieutenant Jamison, (Patrick Wayne), Sergeant Griffin (Chuck Roberson) are wounded. Provo, however, is mortally gunned down by double agents posing as South Vietnamese soldiers. Nim however sets off the hidden explosives which kill the double agents, Parks however finds Provo hit pretty bad but still alive. Just then, Kirby and Muldoon arrive with the Mike Force reinforcements, supported by a US airstrike in which A-1 Skyraiders drop napalm on the attacking enemy troops with little success. Nim is killed by enemy artillery as he is detonating claymore mines to kill more attacking enemy soldiers within the camp's lines.By dawn, with the enemy attack still continuing, Kirby orders the troops to fall back and withdraw from the camp which is then taken by the enemy. At a nearby LZ, more US Army helicopters arrive to evacuate the refugees and Petersen puts Ham Chuck on one of the helicopters and promises to return for him in Da Nang. With the base in VC/NVA hands, Kirby orders an airstrike of a C-47 on the camp, which kills more enemy troops forcing them to withdraw later that day. When the enemy departs, Kirby and his team re-occupy the destroyed camp.Afterwords, Kirby has a talk with Beckworth where the reporter admits that he probably will be fired from the newspaper where he works for filing a story supporting the American war. He then thanks Kirby for the experience and returns to Da Nang with the Mike Force reinforcements. Jamison tells that Provo is requesting Colonel Kirby's presence, however Provo starts to almost die of his wounds but tells Kirby to request for his memorial sign name to the public to be known as 'Provo Privy'.After that battle, Beckworth temporarily disappears from the story, while Kirby meets with his superior officer Colonel Morgan (Bruce Cabot) as well as Kirby's ARVN counterpart, Colonel Cai (Jack Soo), where he is told about a top-secret mission they have been planning to kidnap a very important North Vietnamese field commander named General Pha Son Ti who is currently living in North Vietnam. The capture of General Ti is seen as a bargaining chip to ending the war on South Vietnam's terms as well as disrupt the leadership of the Viet Cong. Colonel Cai uses his sister-in-law, a top Vietnamese fashion model named Lin (Irene Tsu), as a honey trap to lure General Ti to a guarded former French colonial mansion located in a well guarded valley deep in North Vietnam.Kirby, Muldoon, Peterson, and a handful of Green Berets, Montagnards (Degar), and ARVN soldiers are selected for this secret mission by Cai, who will be accompanying them. At nightfall, they are airlifted in a C-130 transport and parachuted into the North Vietnam jungle. After Kirby's point man, Kowalski, is killed by a patrol of local enemy militia, all of whom he kills single-highhandedly, the group continues on. Muldoon, the medical specialist Doc McGee, and two of Cai's men are to stay behind at a local bridge over a river to set explosives to blow it up to prevent the team from being chased by the NVA forces.At nightfall, Kirby and the group arrive outside the guarded plantation where they witness the enemy general arrive at his plantation with Lin. After Kirby and Cai and their men kill all the sentries around the mansion, they quietly enter, subdue the enemy general with Lin's help and hoist him outside, where they put him in the trunk of his car. Kirby, Cai, Petersen, and Lin pack into the car and drive off, but Watson and the rest of the team is killed in a hail of bullets by the North Vietnamese guards while attempting to escape.The next morning, the survivors drive over the bridge which is now fully rigged with explosives. Muldoon, Doc McGee, and the other two ARVN soldiers assisting them escape on motorcycles, but Doc McGee is seriously wounded after being shot in the back by a NVA guard during the escape. The bridge is blown up and the group is reunited in the nearby woods where they dispose of the General's car and successfully airlift the captured General out of the area by a Skyhook device.While Kirby and the group advance through the woods to the LZ for the helicopters to pick them up, Petersen is killed by an enemy booby-trap when he is gorily impaled to a trap of punji sticks. Kirby and his team are forced to leave his dead body behind.Back at Da Nang Air Force base, Beckworth watches as Ham Chuck awaits the return of the helicopters carrying the survivors of the raid. He realizes the toll of the war as Ham Chuck runs crying from helicopter to helicopter, searching for Petersen who is not there. Beckworth then accompanies a group of US soldiers whom have arrived in the country and are sent to the war zone area. Kirby, in a touching moment, walks over to the boy and tells him the sad news. Ham Chuck asks plaintively, ""What will happen to me now?"" Kirby places Petersen's green beret on him and says, ""You let me worry about that, Green Beret. You're what this thing's all about."" The two walk holding hands along the beach into the sunset.","

Matthew Hopkins (Vincent Price), an opportunist and witchhunter, takes advantage of the breakdown in social order to impose a reign of terror on East Anglia. Hopkins and his assistant, John Stearne (Robert Russell), visit village after village, brutally torturing confessions out of suspected witches. They charge the local magistrates for the work they carry out.Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy) is a young Roundhead. After surviving a brief skirmish and killing his first enemy soldier (and thus saving the life of his Captain), he rides home to Brandeston, Suffolk, to visit his lover Sara (Hilary Dwyer). Sara is the niece of the village priest, John Lowes (Rupert Davies). Lowes gives his permission to Marshall to marry Sara, telling him there is trouble coming to the village and he wants Sara far away before it arrives. Marshall asks Sara why the old man is frightened. She tells him they have been threatened and become outcasts in their own village. Marshall vows to Sara, ""rest easy and no-one shall harm you. I put my oath to that."" At the end of his army leave, Marshall rides back to join his regiment, and chances upon Hopkins and Stearne on the path. Marshall gives the two men directions to Brandeston, then rides on.In Brandeston, Hopkins and Stearne immediately begin rounding up suspects. Lowes is thrown into a cell and tortured. He has needles stuck into his back (in an attempt to locate the so-called ""Devil's Mark""), and is about to be killed, when Sara stops Hopkins by offering him sexual favors in exchange for her uncle's safety. However, soon Hopkins is called away to another village. Stearne takes advantage of Hopkins' absence by raping Sara. When Hopkins returns and finds out what Stearne has done, Hopkins will have nothing further to do with the young woman. He instructs Stearne to begin torturing Lowes again. Shortly before departing the village, Hopkins and Stearne execute Lowes and two women.Marshall returns to Brandeston and is horrified by what has happened to Sara. He vows to kill both Hopkins and Stearne. After ""marrying"" Sara in a ceremony of his own devising and instructing her to flee to Lavenham, he rides off by himself. In the meantime, Hopkins and Stearne have become separated after a Roundhead patrol attempts to commandeer their horses. Marshall locates Stearne, but after a brutal fight, Stearne is able to escape. He reunites with Hopkins and informs him of Marshall's desire for revenge.Hopkins and Stearne enter the village of Lavenham. Marshall, on a patrol to locate the King, learns they are there and quickly rides to the village with a group of his soldier friends. Hopkins, however, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, has set a trap to capture Marshall. Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and take them to the castle to be interrogated. Marshall watches as needles are repeatedly jabbed into Sara's back, but he refuses to confess to witchcraft, instead vowing again to kill Hopkins. He breaks free from his bonds at the same time that his army compatriots approach their place of confinement. Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly strikes Hopkins. The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done. One of them puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him dead. Marshalls mind snaps and he shouts, ""You took him from me! You took him from me!"" Sara, also apparently on the brink of insanity, screams uncontrollably over and over again.","

    Synopsis
    The year is 1645 - the middle of the English Civil War. Matthew Hopkins (Vincent Price), an opportunist and witchhunter, takes advantage of the breakdown in social order to impose a reign of terror on East Anglia. Hopkins and his assistant, John Stearne (Robert Russell), visit village after village, brutally torturing confessions out of suspected witches. They charge the local magistrates for the work they carry out.Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy) is a young Roundhead. After surviving a brief skirmish and killing his first enemy soldier (and thus saving the life of his Captain), he rides home to Brandeston, Suffolk, to visit his lover Sara (Hilary Dwyer). Sara is the niece of the village priest, John Lowes (Rupert Davies). Lowes gives his permission to Marshall to marry Sara, telling him there is trouble coming to the village and he wants Sara far away before it arrives. Marshall asks Sara why the old man is frightened. She tells him they have been threatened and become outcasts in their own village. Marshall vows to Sara, ""rest easy and no-one shall harm you. I put my oath to that."" At the end of his army leave, Marshall rides back to join his regiment, and chances upon Hopkins and Stearne on the path. Marshall gives the two men directions to Brandeston, then rides on.In Brandeston, Hopkins and Stearne immediately begin rounding up suspects. Lowes is thrown into a cell and tortured. He has needles stuck into his back (in an attempt to locate the so-called ""Devil's Mark""), and is about to be killed, when Sara stops Hopkins by offering him sexual favors in exchange for her uncle's safety. However, soon Hopkins is called away to another village. Stearne takes advantage of Hopkins' absence by raping Sara. When Hopkins returns and finds out what Stearne has done, Hopkins will have nothing further to do with the young woman. He instructs Stearne to begin torturing Lowes again. Shortly before departing the village, Hopkins and Stearne execute Lowes and two women.Marshall returns to Brandeston and is horrified by what has happened to Sara. He vows to kill both Hopkins and Stearne. After ""marrying"" Sara in a ceremony of his own devising and instructing her to flee to Lavenham, he rides off by himself. In the meantime, Hopkins and Stearne have become separated after a Roundhead patrol attempts to commandeer their horses. Marshall locates Stearne, but after a brutal fight, Stearne is able to escape. He reunites with Hopkins and informs him of Marshall's desire for revenge.Hopkins and Stearne enter the village of Lavenham. Marshall, on a patrol to locate the King, learns they are there and quickly rides to the village with a group of his soldier friends. Hopkins, however, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, has set a trap to capture Marshall. Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and take them to the castle to be interrogated. Marshall watches as needles are repeatedly jabbed into Sara's back, but he refuses to confess to witchcraft, instead vowing again to kill Hopkins. He breaks free from his bonds at the same time that his army compatriots approach their place of confinement. Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly strikes Hopkins. The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done. One of them puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him dead. Marshalls mind snaps and he shouts, ""You took him from me! You took him from me!"" Sara, also apparently on the brink of insanity, screams uncontrollably over and over again.

Pepperland is inhabited by a group of music lovers who dwell in peace and harmony. The peace of Pepperland is threatened by an attack of the Blue Meanies, who hate all music and beauty. Their attack freezes the inhabitants of Pepperland and destroys all of their art and natural beauty. One inhabitant of Pepperland is the uniformed Fred, who is named Admiral by the Lord Mayor and sent off in Pepperland's Yellow Submarine to seek help in the surface world. Young Fred, as he is called by the ancient Lord Mayor, escapes just in time as the mayor is Bonked by the attacking Blue Meanies.(Song:Yellow Submarine) over creditsFred arrives in Liverpool, England and spies upon a lonely Ringo (Song: Elanor Rigby) and follows him home in the submarine. Ringo is made confused and nervous by the sneaky sub and fails to find help from a Bobby (policeman). Fred knocks on Ringo's door, explains the plight of Pepperland and asks him for help. Fred enters the cavernous, weird mansion labled The Pier then is picked up in Ringo's car. Ringo is sympathetic but wants to ask the others, so they start to look for Ringo's mates. They first meet the Frankenstein Monster who turns into John, the leader of the Beatles. They find George meditating atop a mountain in the next room, yet also driving in Ringo's car. ""its all in the mind"" explains George helpfully. Finally, Paul appears from one of the mansion's many doors from an adoring crowd. The Beatles decide to help Old Fred as they have christened him. They depart immediately aboard the Yellow Submarine.Non-animated montage of various scenes of London and the English countryside speed by, giving the illusion of flying as the submarine takes off. (The creshendo of music is from the song ""A Day in the Life"". )The Beatles learn the workings of the submarine from Old Fred (Song: All Together Now) as they go beneath the waves. They sail into the Sea of Time and become very young and then very old Senile Delinquents (Song: When Im Sixty Four). They leave the Sea of Time and enter the Sea of Science. (Song: Only a Northern Song).Finally they arrive in the Sea of Monsters, where a throng of bizarre creatures dwell, some of whom threaten the submarine. But disaster is always averted by the pressing of a random button. That is, until Ringo hits the Panic Button and is hurled onto the back of a galloping monster. The rest of the Beatles manage to rescue him, but soon after they are swallowed by the dreaded Vacuum Thrask. The Thrask then swallows the entire sea of monsters. The Thrask has nothing left to suck up until it notices its own tail. It sucks up the tail and disappears up its own existence. Luckily, this causes the Yellow Submarine to be thrown clear.The Submarine motor has malfunctioned and they come to rest in the blank nothingness that is Nowhere Land. The Beatles notice that there is an inhabitant here, the tiny, poetry spouting Nowhere Man. He introduces himself as Jeremy Hillary Boob, Phd. Jeremy fixes the motor and goes back to his meaningless activities. (Song: Nowhere Man) Ringo feels sorry for Jeremy and invites him aboard.They sail for a while, but the submarine conks out again. The Beatles and Jeremy get out to try and repair the ship. Jeremy fixes the screw with bubble gum, but this causes the Yellow Submarine to take off with Old Fred and leaves the rest stranded. They realize that they are in the Foothills of the Headlands. John questions the heads and meets a lady friend. (Song: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds). They realize that they must be near Pepperland since the ground is covered with pepper. The pepper causes the heads to sneeze, blowing our friends all the way to the Sea of Holes. They remember Old Fred told them that the way to Pepperland was via the Sea of Holes to the Sea of Green. They search the holes and Ringo puts a hole in his pocket. Jeremy is kidnapped by a lurking Blue Meanie while the others are searching for a way out. Finally, they find the Sea of Green and end up in Pepperland just as Old Fred arrives in the Yellow Submarine.Old Fred suggests that the Lord Mayor can be revived by music, and the Beatles hum a tune and the Lord Mayor is UnBonked. The mayor notices that the Beatles strongly resemble Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He suggests that they disguise themselves as the band and rally the land to rebellion. Since their instruments were lost in the Sea of Monsters, they sneak past the sleeping Blue Meanies to the Bandstand where all of the musical instruments are being held.They find instruments, and band uniforms belonging to Sgt.

                    The Beatles are spirited away in the eponymous yellow submarine to save Pepperland from the dreaded Blue Meanies. Along the way, the singing saviors encounter a surreal feast for both the eyes and ears: phantasmagorical creatures, outrageous landscapes, and colors that throb and vibrate to each and every Beatle song on the soundtrack. It's a drug-free, hallucinogenic journey for the armchair tripper, the peak of which is undoubtedly (and not surprisingly) the ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" sequence. An incredible film experience at all levels, ""Yellow Submarine"" manages to capture exquisitely and in visual form the beauty and madness of the incomparable Beatles. And to think 1968 also included Kubrick's ""2001!""

    Synopsis
    Once upon a time or maybe twice there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland, 80,000 leagues under the sea. Pepperland is inhabited by a group of music lovers who dwell in peace and harmony. The peace of Pepperland is threatened by an attack of the Blue Meanies, who hate all music and beauty. Their attack freezes the inhabitants of Pepperland and destroys all of their art and natural beauty. One inhabitant of Pepperland is the uniformed Fred, who is named Admiral by the Lord Mayor and sent off in Pepperland's Yellow Submarine to seek help in the surface world. Young Fred, as he is called by the ancient Lord Mayor, escapes just in time as the mayor is Bonked by the attacking Blue Meanies.(Song:Yellow Submarine) over creditsFred arrives in Liverpool, England and spies upon a lonely Ringo (Song: Elanor Rigby) and follows him home in the submarine. Ringo is made confused and nervous by the sneaky sub and fails to find help from a Bobby (policeman). Fred knocks on Ringo's door, explains the plight of Pepperland and asks him for help. Fred enters the cavernous, weird mansion labled The Pier then is picked up in Ringo's car. Ringo is sympathetic but wants to ask the others, so they start to look for Ringo's mates. They first meet the Frankenstein Monster who turns into John, the leader of the Beatles. They find George meditating atop a mountain in the next room, yet also driving in Ringo's car. ""its all in the mind"" explains George helpfully. Finally, Paul appears from one of the mansion's many doors from an adoring crowd. The Beatles decide to help Old Fred as they have christened him. They depart immediately aboard the Yellow Submarine.Non-animated montage of various scenes of London and the English countryside speed by, giving the illusion of flying as the submarine takes off. (The creshendo of music is from the song ""A Day in the Life"". )The Beatles learn the workings of the submarine from Old Fred (Song: All Together Now) as they go beneath the waves. They sail into the Sea of Time and become very young and then very old Senile Delinquents (Song: When Im Sixty Four). They leave the Sea of Time and enter the Sea of Science. (Song: Only a Northern Song).Finally they arrive in the Sea of Monsters, where a throng of bizarre creatures dwell, some of whom threaten the submarine. But disaster is always averted by the pressing of a random button. That is, until Ringo hits the Panic Button and is hurled onto the back of a galloping monster. The rest of the Beatles manage to rescue him, but soon after they are swallowed by the dreaded Vacuum Thrask. The Thrask then swallows the entire sea of monsters. The Thrask has nothing left to suck up until it notices its own tail. It sucks up the tail and disappears up its own existence. Luckily, this causes the Yellow Submarine to be thrown clear.The Submarine motor has malfunctioned and they come to rest in the blank nothingness that is Nowhere Land. The Beatles notice that there is an inhabitant here, the tiny, poetry spouting Nowhere Man. He introduces himself as Jeremy Hillary Boob, Phd. Jeremy fixes the motor and goes back to his meaningless activities. (Song: Nowhere Man) Ringo feels sorry for Jeremy and invites him aboard.They sail for a while, but the submarine conks out again. The Beatles and Jeremy get out to try and repair the ship. Jeremy fixes the screw with bubble gum, but this causes the Yellow Submarine to take off with Old Fred and leaves the rest stranded. They realize that they are in the Foothills of the Headlands. John questions the heads and meets a lady friend. (Song: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds). They realize that they must be near Pepperland since the ground is covered with pepper. The pepper causes the heads to sneeze, blowing our friends all the way to the Sea of Holes. They remember Old Fred told them that the way to Pepperland was via the Sea of Holes to the Sea of Green. They search the holes and Ringo puts a hole in his pocket. Jeremy is kidnapped by a lurking Blue Meanie while the others are searching for a way out. Finally, they find the Sea of Green and end up in Pepperland just as Old Fred arrives in the Yellow Submarine.Old Fred suggests that the Lord Mayor can be revived by music, and the Beatles hum a tune and the Lord Mayor is UnBonked. The mayor notices that the Beatles strongly resemble Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He suggests that they disguise themselves as the band and rally the land to rebellion. Since their instruments were lost in the Sea of Monsters, they sneak past the sleeping Blue Meanies to the Bandstand where all of the musical instruments are being held.They find instruments, and band uniforms belonging to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. They hide until dawn and make their escape. They are almost caught when George steps on a bagpipe, but they escape and begin to rally and unfreeze the people of Pepperland. (Songs: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and part of A Little Help From My Friends).The Beatles then dispatch a group of giant Blue Meanies called Apple Bonkers by standing on each other's shoulders and bonking the giants and their Blue Meanie Sergeant with a huge Baldwin Apple.The Chief Blue Meanie and his henchman Max notice what is going on and dispatch the Dreadful Flying Glove to stop the Beatles.

"31","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063121/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The time is the late '60's, deep in the chill of the Cold War. As observers in both Russia and the USA watch closely, an orbiting spy satellite re-enters the atmosphere, parachuting down to a soft landing in the desolate Arctic wastes. Soon, a hooded figure fights his way through the ice-storm and retrieves the capsule, unaware that, hidden nearby, another figure is watching his every move.Not long afterwards, the world is shocked to learn that Drift Ice Staton Zebra, a scientific weather station at the North Pole, has met with disaster. The weak distress calls first issued have fallen silent, and the nuclear sub Tigerfish, commanded by James Ferraday (Rock Hudson) is being sent to attempt a rescue. Oddly, the mission also includes a platoon of Marines, as well as a mysterious British agent known only as Mr. Jones (Patrick McGoohan), and a boisterous Russian defector, Boris Vaslov (Ernest Borgnine). Ferraday's orders are to get Mr. Jones to Zebra as swiftly as possible, but without any explanation as to why, a situation he is none too pleased with.Submerging, the submarine travels under the Polar ice cap, hoping to break through the thin ice near Zebra. As they near their destination, a torpedo is readied in order to blow a hole through the ice. Checking the torpedo tube, a slight trickle of seawater is noted draining from it, but all indicators show clear. The hatch is hard to open, and as the crewman thrusts against the handle, it suddenly slams open, ice-cold seawater flooding the torpedo room.Fighting for their lives, the men struggle to close the outer hatch while Ferraday orders engines full astern, hoping to prevent the crippled boat from heading for the bottom. Pumping pressurized air into the flooded forward rooms and red-lining the engines does little, and the Tigerfish plummets deeper and deeper into the darkness. Passing far below their dive limit, the outer torpedo door finally begins to close, and once sealed the boat slows its deadly descent. At extreme depth, and withstanding incredible pressures, they manage to halt the dive, and slowly head back up. Badly shaken, they are further stunned at Jones' claim that this was no accident. Someone very capable had sabotaged the tube controls, and tried to murder them all.Ferraday has had enough of Jones and Vaslov's cloak-and-dagger tactics and demands to know what the hell they are really doing here. ""You seem to know an awful lot about the business of operating a submarine"", snarls Ferraday.""I know how to wreck them,"" replies Jones, shivering under a blanket. The situation begins to turn ugly, but the sonar man breaks in to report they are now under Zebra's position. Disgusted, Ferraday leaves for the control room.With consummate skill, the crew locate and surface through a relatively thin layer of ice, exposing the submarine's conning tower to the blast of an Arctic ice storm. Quickly taking a fix in Zebra's weak signal, a rescue team sets out across the rugged ice pack, led by Jones, Vaslov and Ferraday. Only a few miles need to be covered, but the way is filled with danger, and several men are nearly lost when an unseen crevasse opens up at their feet. Tied together for safety, the other manage to pull the trapped men out, but back at the Tigerfish, the ice pack is shifting, squeezing the submarine. Unable to contact Zebra or the rescue party, they are forced to submerge once more.As they near the station, Jones can smell burned rubber in the tearing wind. Finally stumbling into the camp, they see through the storm that the station is in a shambles. Several of the huts are wrecked or burned, and there seem to be no survivors. Cautiously searching the huts they find one is still intact and sheltering a few numbed, barely alive scientists, and these are quickly warmed and revived. Jones and Vaslov both find familiar faces and begin to probe for answers as to what happened, but the frozen men are still too much in shock to provide any information. Leaving the scientists to the rescue team, Jones begins to hunt through the rest of the camp, desperately searching for something. In what's left of the laboratory, he turns to find Ferraday watching him.""What size is the film?"" Ferraday asks.Surprised, Jones replies that it's a standard film canister, ""And all of a sudden, you know a whole damn lot about my business."" Ferraday confesses that he has been briefed on the real nature of their mission, despite all the precautions taken by Jones, so he continues to elaborate. The film he's searching for came from a Russian spy satellite, equipped with a special camera stolen from the British, and using a new type of film developed by the Americans, ""all very hush-hush,"" says Jones. Launched by the Russians, it was capable of taking pictures of incredible detail, and it had photos of all missile bases in North America. Unfortunately for the Russians, something went wrong, ""and that darling little satellite just kept on taking pictures of Soviet missile bases, even when it wasn't supposed to, making it the most valuable piece of film in the world."" Attempting a recovery, the satellite merely shifted to a new polar orbit, meaning that the only choice the Russians had to bring it down was over the North Pole. The British sent an agent up to Zebra, as did the Russians, and the satellite was brought down. ""Then disaster, fire, silence,"" mused Jones, ""and here we are. No agents, no clues, and no film."" As they think about their next move, a deathly silence settles over the camp: the storm is finally dying down.Ferraday uses an ice drill from the tool shed, and has his men drill a small hole in the ice a short distance from the camp. Dropping a transponder down the hole, they are quickly located by the Tigerfish which surfaces through the ice a few minutes later. ""I want a hundred men out here on the double,"" orders Ferraday. The entire crew is sent out through the camp and across the ice, looking for the hidden film. Meanwhile Jones has discovered a homing device hidden in the fuel tank of the camp's tractor, and he turns to leave the hut.A crowbar strikes him across the chest, flinging him back across the room and knocking him out. The attacker cautiously approaches and pulls his hood back; it is Vaslov, the Russian defector, and Jones' supposed friend. Now revealed as a double-agent, he takes the homing device to search for the hidden film but is caught by the Captain of the marine platoon, and they fight to the death. Just as the marine gains the advantage, shots ring out and he falls to the floor, dead. Jones had come to and shot the marine, thinking he was the traitor. Ferraday and the others hear the shots and come running in before Vaslov can regain the homing device, and he quickly re-assumes his old character. As the others take the homer out to search, Ferraday looks over the fight scene with suspicion. Re-checking the tractor fuel tank, he finds another device wrapped in plastic.The homer quickly finds the film canister, buried in the ice a few yards from the camp. Torches are brought out to melt the ice away, but another problem looms. The clearing storm has allowed the Russians to fly over the camp and drop a squadron of paratroops to take the camp and the film by force. As the Russians approach the camp, Ferraday orders most of the men back into the submarine. The Russian Captain steps quietly up to the edge of the camp, and calmly asks for Ferraday by name, claiming the satellite is Soviet property and stating that they wish only to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. A tense situation ensues, and Ferraday stalls for time while the canister is melted out of the ice. A tricky self-destruct device had been attached to the canister, making things even more difficult. The Russian captain gives Ferraday two minutes to turn over the canister.Vaslov, still playing the double agent, disarms the small bomb and opens the canister removing the priceless film. Still shaky, Jones walks up behind and observes. Ferraday calmly re-arms the bomb and carries the canister to the Russian captain, tossing it lightly to him. But the captain is no fool, he too disarms the bomb and checks the canister and when he finds it is empty, an order is barked and the Russians open fire.Smoke bombs are fired into the camp, filling the air with dense fog and hiding everything. Vaslov sees his chance in the confusion, and runs for the Russian troops outside the camp. Another man looms up in his path: Jones. Smiling grimly at each other, they both realize the charade is over, and they begin a fight to the death as machine gun fire whistles all around them. As the smoke clears and everyone is ordered to hold their fire, Vaslov is lying on the ice and Jones is holding the film.Covered by the Russians, Jones cannot escape. Ferraday takes control of the situation and orders Jones to drop the film. Shooting a venomous look at Ferraday, Jones is forced to toss the film at the Russians in defeat. The film is quickly returned to the canister, still attached to its self-destruct unit, and run up a thin line attached to a weather balloon for collection by a circling Russian plane. As the aircraft approaches, Ferraday turns his hand and reveals the object he'd found hidden in the fuel tank: a remote trigger for the self-destruct unit on the canister. Jones looks at the device and then at Ferraday, understanding dawning on his face.Just as the Soviet plane swoops down to snare the canister, Ferraday triggers the bomb. In a brilliant flash, the capsule and its film are destroyed, startling everyone. The Russian captain looks across to Ferraday, also beginning to understand. Stepping back across the ice, they contemplate each other for a moment.""Our mission here is completed"" he says, ""at least in part.""""Agreed"", replies Ferraday. With the precious film now gone, both sides realize it is time to leave. The Americans move to pick up their wounded, and Ferraday tells the Russian that ""you sir, may pick up your man"", indicating Vaslov, still laying on the ice. They separate, and make ready to depart.The Tigerfish, carrying the Zebra survivors and wounded marines, submerges once more and begins its long voyage back home.","
    
                    Commander James Ferraday, USN, has new orders: get David Jones, a British civilian, Captain Anders, a tough Marine with a platoon of troops, Boris Vasilov, a friendly Russian, and the crew of the nuclear sub USS Tigerfish to the North Pole to rescue the crew of Drift Ice Station Zebra, a weather station at the top of the world. The mission takes on new and dangerous twists as the crew finds out that all is not as it seems at Zebra, and that someone will stop at nothing to prevent the mission from being completed.

                    US naval Commander Jim Ferrady's next mission is to sail his nuclear submarine, the USS Tigerfish, to the multi-nation polar located weather station Zebra. He is told that the mission, which is concurrently being conducted by the Soviets as well, is under the pretense of saving its crew from something that has killed or is killing them. This situation is true, but the real mission is something else related to the ice station. A civilian Brit with a code name Jones, who will be sailing with him and who he doesn't fully trust, knows the real reason of the mission, but refuses to disclose it, but promises to do so if it risks the lives of the sub's crew. Another on board the sub is anti-Soviet Soviet Boris Vaslov, one of the designers of the station. As Vaslov is a friend of Jones, Ferraday also doesn't fully trust him. Jones, in turn, doesn't fully trust everyone on board, most specifically Captain Leslie Anders, who is leading the command of the marines for the mission. It soon becomes apparent that one of these mistrusts is founded as someone on board is sabotaging the mission, that person who is willing to die and kill everyone aboard the sub. The new concurrent mission is to find the saboteur, and discover for who he is working and their motives.

Along the way, they collect two additional passengers, a Russian named Boris Vaslov, likely also a spy, and U.S. Marine Capt. Leslie Anders who will takes command of the Marines traveling as passengers. It soon becomes apparent that the mission is more that just a simple rescue operation. It also becomes apparent that there is a traitor on board the submarine who is out to sabotage the entire mission.

Launched by the Russians, it was capable of taking pictures of incredible detail, and it had photos of all missile bases in North America. Unfortunately for the Russians, something went wrong, ""and that darling little satellite just kept on taking pictures of Soviet missile bases, even when it wasn't supposed to, making it the most valuable piece of film in the world."" Attempting a recovery, the satellite merely shifted to a new polar orbit, meaning that the only choice the Russians had to bring it down was over the North Pole. The British sent an agent up to Zebra, as did the Russians, and the satellite was brought down. ""Then disaster, fire, silence,"" mused Jones, ""and here we are. No agents, no clues, and no film."" As they think about their next move, a deathly silence settles over the camp: the storm is finally dying down.Ferraday uses an ice drill from the tool shed, and has his men drill a small hole in the ice a short distance from the camp. Dropping a transponder down the hole, they are quickly located by the Tigerfish which surfaces through the ice a few minutes later. ""I want a hundred men out here on the double,"" orders Ferraday. The entire crew is sent out through the camp and across the ice, looking for the hidden film. Meanwhile Jones has discovered a homing device hidden in the fuel tank of the camp's tractor, and he turns to leave the hut.A crowbar strikes him across the chest, flinging him back across the room and knocking him out. The attacker cautiously approaches and pulls his hood back; it is Vaslov, the Russian defector, and Jones' supposed friend. Now revealed as a double-agent, he takes the homing device to search for the hidden film but is caught by the Captain of the marine platoon, and they fight to the death. Just as the marine gains the advantage, shots ring out and he falls to the floor, dead. Jones had come to and shot the marine, thinking he was the traitor. Ferraday and the others hear the shots and come running in before Vaslov can regain the homing device, and he quickly re-assumes his old character. As the others take the homer out to search, Ferraday looks over the fight scene with suspicion. Re-checking the tractor fuel tank, he finds another device wrapped in plastic.The homer quickly finds the film canister, buried in the ice a few yards from the camp. Torches are brought out to melt the ice away, but another problem looms. The clearing storm has allowed the Russians to fly over the camp and drop a squadron of paratroops to take the camp and the film by force. As the Russians approach the camp, Ferraday orders most of the men back into the submarine. The Russian Captain steps quietly up to the edge of the camp, and calmly asks for Ferraday by name, claiming the satellite is Soviet property and stating that they wish only to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. A tense situation ensues, and Ferraday stalls for time while the canister is melted out of the ice. A tricky self-destruct device had been attached to the canister, making things even more difficult. The Russian captain gives Ferraday two minutes to turn over the canister.Vaslov, still playing the double agent, disarms the small bomb and opens the canister removing the priceless film. Still shaky, Jones walks up behind and observes. Ferraday calmly re-arms the bomb and carries the canister to the Russian captain, tossing it lightly to him. But the captain is no fool, he too disarms the bomb and checks the canister and when he finds it is empty, an order is barked and the Russians open fire.Smoke bombs are fired into the camp, filling the air with dense fog and hiding everything. Vaslov sees his chance in the confusion, and runs for the Russian troops outside the camp. Another man looms up in his path: Jones. Smiling grimly at each other, they both realize the charade is over, and they begin a fight to the death as machine gun fire whistles all around them. As the smoke clears and everyone is ordered to hold their fire, Vaslov is lying on the ice and Jones is holding the film.Covered by the Russians, Jones cannot escape. Ferraday takes control of the situation and orders Jones to drop the film. Shooting a venomous look at Ferraday, Jones is forced to toss the film at the Russians in defeat. The film is quickly returned to the canister, still attached to its self-destruct unit, and run up a thin line attached to a weather balloon for collection by a circling Russian plane. As the aircraft approaches, Ferraday turns his hand and reveals the object he'd found hidden in the fuel tank: a remote trigger for the self-destruct unit on the canister. Jones looks at the device and then at Ferraday, understanding dawning on his face.Just as the Soviet plane swoops down to snare the canister, Ferraday triggers the bomb. In a brilliant flash, the capsule and its film are destroyed, startling everyone. The Russian captain looks across to Ferraday, also beginning to understand. Stepping back across the ice, they contemplate each other for a moment.""Our mission here is completed"" he says, ""at least in part.""""Agreed"", replies Ferraday. With the precious film now gone, both sides realize it is time to leave. The Americans move to pick up their wounded, and Ferraday tells the Russian that ""you sir, may pick up your man"", indicating Vaslov, still laying on the ice. They separate, and make ready to depart.The Tigerfish, carrying the Zebra survivors and wounded marines, submerges once more and begins its long voyage back home.

                    Three directors each adapt a Poe short story to the screen: ""Toby Dammit"" features a disheveled drugged and drunk English movie star who nods acceptance in the Italian press and his producers fawn over him. ""Metzengerstein"" features a Mediveal countess who has a love-hate relationship with a black stallion - who, it turns out is really her dead lover. ""William Wilson"" tells the story of a sadistic Austrian student with an exact double whom he later kills.

                    Three short stories by Edgar Allan Poe are adapted for the screen, each under the helm of a different filmmaker. In ""Metzengerstein"", the Contessa Frederique de Metzengerstein is a wealthy, depraved and cruel young woman, whose actions are for her own amusement regardless of the affect they have on other people. Her cousin, Baron Wilhelm Berlifitzing, is her closest neighbor, although the two do not really know each other. Unlike Frederique, Wilhelm is a content and happy person. Upon first sighting, Frederique becomes obsessed with her cousin. An incident initiated by Frederique that affects Wilhelm directly has a profound effect on her psyche, which is only strengthened with the arrival of a wild black stallion into her life, from where the stallion came no one knows. In ""William Wilson"", a young non-Cathloic man named William Wilson feels the need to confess to a Catholic priest of a murder he just committed. His story starts as a boy when he was a cadet in a military school, he a sadistic person who tormented those classmates with who he had issue, with many of his other classmates mindlessly following him in not wanting to face his wrath. He brings his sadistic behavior into adulthood, first as a medical student, then as a military man in the Austrian army. But it is someone from his childhood who follows him, in body and/or spirit, that may ultimately be William's match. In ""Toby Dammit"", the title character, a British Shakespearean actor, has just landed in Rome where he is scheduled to film a movie, in the role of Christ in the first ever Catholic western. He is unabashedly self-indulgent and has open contempt for the business, even for his fans. He is also neurotic and tormented, he who copes with excessive alcohol. It is a Ferrari which he asked and received as a bonus for the film that he uses as his ultimate weapon to deal with his pain.

The island is owned by Baron von Merkens, who lives in the big castle on the island with his wife, Corinne. Although the von Merkens don't know the Borgs personally, they know of him and his art. Johan and Alma love each other, but their relationship is somewhat clinical - they rarely, if ever, kiss - unlike the passion that he shared with a former love, Veronica Vogler, about who Alma knows. Johan suffers both from insomnia and nyctophobia, both in combination which are causing problems for him. Rather than confide in Alma those problems, Johan instead writes them all down in his diary. What happens to Johan and what Johan does in light of these problems is affected by Alma getting a hold of his diary and wanting to help him through these issues, and their joint and individual encounters with the von Merkens and their social circle, which includes a person from Johan's past.

                    A fictionalized account of the First Special Service Force, the joint Canadian-American World War II commando group under the command of Col. Robert T. Frederick. The Canadians are the best that the Canadian Army has to offer: spit and polish, multiskilled, experienced soldiers. The Americans are the dregs of the U.S. Army: misfits and troublemakers lacking any kind of discipline. Over time, Frederick forges a unified, highly competent fighting force. Initially trained for a commando operation in Norway, Frederick has to move quickly to keep the unit together after the operation was canceled. They are sent to Italy where they distinguish themselves in battle.

The night of his arrival coincides with a charity bazaar at the hotel where he will be boarding: Blackbeard's Inn, named after the notorious English pirate Captain Edward Teach, and now run by the elderly descendants of the pirate's crew. The owners are attempting to pay off their mortgage in order to keep the inn from being bought by the local crime boss, Silky Seymour (Joby Baker), who wants to build a casino on the land. In quick succession, Steve discovers his track team's shortcomings and runs afoul of the stiff dean of Godolphin College, its football coach, and Seymour; but he also makes the acquaintance of an attractive Godolphin professor, Jo Anne Baker (Suzanne Pleshette), who is anxious to help the elderly ladies save the Inn.A bidding war with the football coach at the charity auction nets Steve an antique bed warmer, once owned by Blackbeard's wife, Aldetha Teach, who - in addition to being a witch - is also the spitting image of Jo Anne. Inside this bed warmer is hidden a book of magic spells, that had once been the property of Aldetha. Steve recites one on a lark, unintentionally conjuring up the ghost of Captain Blackbeard (Peter Ustinov), who appears as a socially-inappropriate drunkard whose wife cursed him to an existence in limbo since his death in 1718 for all eternity unless he can perform one good deed.Steve and Captain Blackbeard soon learn that the two of them are bound to one another by the power of the spell and only the very reluctant and somewhat eccentric Steve can see or hear the ghost (whom is also coporial and can physically moves things with nobody seeing his physical image). As a result, the increasingly frustrated Steve must deal with the antics of the wayward pirate while attempting to revive Godolphin's track team and form a relationship with Jo Anne.The next evening, Steve gets arrested falsely for drunk driving in his automobile, which was in the control of Blackbeard, who was steering the steering wheel like a pirate ship. As a result of this, as well as causing the cop's motorcycle to crash into a tree, he spends a night in jail, while Blackbeard goes in and out of the cell creating havoc for Steve who begins to lose his sanity among all of this (Steve keeps forgeting that no one, except him, can see or hear Blackbeard and begins to increasingly talk to him in public with everyone around him thinking that Steve has finally lost his sanity... which is only half-true).While in jail, Steve tells Blackbeard what Mrs. Stowcroft mentioned that if Blackbeard did a good deed, the curse would be broken. However, when Steve asks for the treasure that would help save the Daughters of the Buccaneers, in keeping the inn, Blackbeard admits that his hidden treasure no longer exists for he had spent all of the money years before his death, therefore causing Steve to no longer trust Blackbeard.Steve gets released from jail the next day, but he's placed on probation with the college due to this mistaken drunk driving incident and rumors of mental incapacity. The hostile Dean tells Steve that his team has to win the Broxton relays, or he will be finished.

Panic starts to ensue not only in the general population, but also within the police forces in the Boston area, they who start to apprehend and question every known sexual criminal. Things for the police departments start to get out of control when the victimology is extended to younger women with subsequent stranglings. To show the public that the commonwealth is taking the matter seriously, the state attorney general appoints law professor John S. Bottomly to lead a multi-jurisdictional task force to apprehend the perpetrator. Bottomly feels ill equipped to do so. But he and his team come across two leads: one being a victim, Dianne Cluny, who survives her strangling, and two being a man named Albert DeSalvo being detained for a seemingly unrelated crime. Bottomly notices that DeSalvo, who is institutionalized as he is diagnosed with a possible case of dissociative identity disorder, has an injury matching one that Cluny inflicted on the strangler. Beyond his mental disorder, DeSalvo seems like a decent man. Regardless, Bottomly wants to find out conclusively if DeSalvo is indeed the strangler, even if he will never be tried for the crimes, and even if it causes DeSalvo possible permanent injury to his psyche.

"46","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063049/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","This movie 'Head' is about the nature of free will, conceived and edited in a stream of consciousness style with no plot at all.'Head' begins at the dedication of a bridge. As a local politician struggles with his microphone during the dedication speech, the ""wacky, fun-loving"" Monkees (Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork, and Michael Nesmith), suddenly interrupt the ceremony by running through the assembled officials, to the sound of various horns and sirens....The rest of the film shows what happened that led up to that.Earlier... the four have just all kissed the same groupie, who tells them that they were indistinguishable. Throughout the film, they make their way both together and seperately through a series of unrelated vignettes, each being a different type of movie (a mystery, a war movie, a western, a desert adventure, etc...).One memorable segment shows Micky trecking alone through a vast desert until he finds a soft drink vending machine standing on top of a sand dune. He is overjoyed to find that it is not a mirage, and happy that he has spare change, but infurated when the machine takes his money and gives him nothing back, for the machine is out of order. Then a small group of heavily armed soldiers, complete with a tank and all, arrive to fight Micky for control of the vending machine until Micky subdues the commanding officer, the entire unit surrenders to the lone Micky, who then takes advantage of this to commandeer the tank and blows up the broken down vending machine.In each one segment, the Monkees try to deal with the fact that they're four real people in a real band that makes records for real people, but are also scripted characters in a fake TV band doing nothing except exactly what the director wants them to.They continually try to prove to themselves that they're free and can make any choice they want. But no matter what they try deliberately flubbing their lines in scenes from their TV show, pointing out to other characters that they're really just actors making a movie, complaining to producers Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson... who are on the set but not part of the film, smashing through the painted paper walls, walking off the set and into the street, physically attacking other actors for no reason, and making everyone they encounter mad at them they discover that their every word and deed was predetermined to the finest detail by the script of the movie they're in and the director directing it.For example, they forget their worries at a party where girls are go-go dancing. But a mirror on the wall reveals the movie camera shooting directly into it, recording the scene we are watching while Rafelson sits next to the camera in the mirror.At one point, Peter actually discovers the answer to the free will contradiction in their reality. The four frequently find themselves inside a large black box from which they cannot escape. The box represents the constraints of being fictional characters unable to make any real choices.

                    Running in from seemingly nowhere, Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith & Peter Tork - better known collectively as The Monkees - disrupt a bridge opening ceremony. From where and why did they come to disrupt the proceedings? They were filming a series of vignettes in several different genres, including a wild west sequence, a desert war sequence, a Confederate war sequence, and a science fiction sequence. They disagree with much of what is happening around them, and try to figure out how to escape the oppression they feel - symbolized by a big black box in which they are seemingly imprisoned - by the forces around. That oppression is often shown in the form of ""The Big Victor Mature"".

                    In this 1968 film, the Monkees valiantly attempted to deflate their own myth. The plot is, essentially, about demystification. Mickey Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork, and Mike Nesmith - with the aid of writer Jack Nicholson (the only credited author due to legalities)- tackle such topics as filmmaking, the media treatment and madness of the Vietnam War, Davy Jones' ""way with the ladies"", and, most importantly, commercialization. Each group member is presented in a unique light - in every case shattering the image that had been produced by the ""media machine"". The Monkees went out on a limb with this film by creating an almost surreal work with a loosely bound ""plot"". Their younger fans, unfortunately, simply missed the point. Because of the poor publicity of the film at the time of its release, older teenagers had no clue what ""Head"" was trying to say. As a result, its box office showing was disastrous. ""Head"" is more for the film enthusiast than the casual Monkees fan in some respects. The soundtrack does, however, feature some of the finest and most sophisticated music of the group's career. And yes, they DO play their own instruments on the tunes, but receive assistance in composing and performing from the likes of Neil Young, Stephen Stills, and Carole King.

    Synopsis
    This movie 'Head' is about the nature of free will, conceived and edited in a stream of consciousness style with no plot at all.'Head' begins at the dedication of a bridge. As a local politician struggles with his microphone during the dedication speech, the ""wacky, fun-loving"" Monkees (Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork, and Michael Nesmith), suddenly interrupt the ceremony by running through the assembled officials, to the sound of various horns and sirens....The rest of the film shows what happened that led up to that.Earlier... the four have just all kissed the same groupie, who tells them that they were indistinguishable. Throughout the film, they make their way both together and seperately through a series of unrelated vignettes, each being a different type of movie (a mystery, a war movie, a western, a desert adventure, etc...).One memorable segment shows Micky trecking alone through a vast desert until he finds a soft drink vending machine standing on top of a sand dune. He is overjoyed to find that it is not a mirage, and happy that he has spare change, but infurated when the machine takes his money and gives him nothing back, for the machine is out of order. Then a small group of heavily armed soldiers, complete with a tank and all, arrive to fight Micky for control of the vending machine until Micky subdues the commanding officer, the entire unit surrenders to the lone Micky, who then takes advantage of this to commandeer the tank and blows up the broken down vending machine.In each one segment, the Monkees try to deal with the fact that they're four real people in a real band that makes records for real people, but are also scripted characters in a fake TV band doing nothing except exactly what the director wants them to.They continually try to prove to themselves that they're free and can make any choice they want. But no matter what they try deliberately flubbing their lines in scenes from their TV show, pointing out to other characters that they're really just actors making a movie, complaining to producers Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson... who are on the set but not part of the film, smashing through the painted paper walls, walking off the set and into the street, physically attacking other actors for no reason, and making everyone they encounter mad at them they discover that their every word and deed was predetermined to the finest detail by the script of the movie they're in and the director directing it.For example, they forget their worries at a party where girls are go-go dancing. But a mirror on the wall reveals the movie camera shooting directly into it, recording the scene we are watching while Rafelson sits next to the camera in the mirror.At one point, Peter actually discovers the answer to the free will contradiction in their reality. The four frequently find themselves inside a large black box from which they cannot escape. The box represents the constraints of being fictional characters unable to make any real choices. Peter announces that he will talk about the nature of conceptual reality, then informs the others that ""it doesn't matter if we're in the box"". He realizes that the difference between free will and pre-scripted action is illusory. As long as you can do anything you want, 'it doesn't matter' if your choices were known in advance by some powerful entity in a higher level of context outside the universe, because the situation in which you find yourself is identical to one in which there is no outer context and you really are free.Unfortunately, the other three pay no attention to Pete's liberating revelation, which they characterize as navel-contemplating nonsense, and soon, even Pete forgets about it.While being chased by everyone they've encountered (and disrupted) in the various vignettes, they run onto a bridge, shoving people out of the way.

The clip ends with the final fade out and it is being shown in a small screening room somewhere in Hollywood. The elderly star of the film, Byron Orlock (Boris Karloff), tells the producer Marshall Smith (Monty Landis) that he has decided to retire from acting because he considers his performance no longer frightening in mainstream society. Marshall and the film's director Sammy Michaels (director Peter Bogdanovich) try to convince him to appear in their next film, but Orlok refuses and plans to return to his native England to live out the rest of his days, and refuses to even read the new script that Sammy gives to him. Orlok walks out with his young secretary Jenny (Nancy Hsueh), whom is Sammy's current girlfriend. Sammy follows him outside to persuade him to stay in Hollywood, but Orlok tells Sammy that he considers himself to be an anachronism because people are no longer frightened by horror pictures. ""The world belongs to the young. Let them have it"", says Orlock.Across the street, a young man named Bobby Thompson (Tim O'Kelly) is seen buying a high-powered semi-automatic .303 caliber hunting rifle and pays with it by check. He goes out to the parking lot to his white convertible and places the newly purchased rifle in his car truck which has more then a dozen firearms of various calibers. Bobby drives along a freeway listening to the car radio and munching on Baby Ruth candy bars. He arrives home in a suburb of the San Fernando Valley where he lives with his wife Ilene (Tanya Morgan) and his parents and has dinner with them.Across town, Orlok is dining with Jenny at a local restaurant when his manager Ed Laughlin (Arthur Peterson) arrives and tries to persuade him to stay in town at least for a few days to attend the premier of 'The Terror' at a local Racine drive-in theater the following evening. But Orlok refuses and even refuses to speak to Marshall over a phone that Ed tries to set up.After dinner, Bobby and his father go out to a shooting range where they shoot at tin can targets. Bobby has a keen talent from shooting guns apparently due to his recent military service. Since Bobby still lives with his parents, its convenient for him and his father, Robert Thompson Sr., to go out shooting together. While his father is setting up more tin targets, Bobby, for some odd reason points his rifle at his father seemingly intent on shooting him. Robert Thompson sees Bobby aiming the rifle at him and orders him to put the rifle down, because pointing a gun a people goes against everything he has taught his son.That evening, Orlok is in his hotel suite with Jenny who is setting up his schedule for his return to England the following day. Jenny also tries to persuade Orlok to stay at least for the premier of his latest film, but Orlok tells her that he is through with the movie business and still refuses to read Sammy's script. Orlok then sends her home while he stays alone in his room to watch TV.At the Thompson house that evening, the whole family is watching TV together when Ilene says that she has to go to her night job as a switchboard operator. Bobby follows her to the bedroom and wants to talk to her saying that he has not been feeling well lately and has been getting ""funny ideas"". But since she is late for her job, she tells him that she doesn't have time to talk and leaves. He asks her not to take his car but take her mother's to work and she agrees. After Ilene leaves and his parents go to bed for the night, Bobby goes to his car and takes out one of his guns, a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol before returning to the house.At Orlok's hotel room, he orders room service and watches himself on one of his old movies 'The Criminal Code' that is playing as a late-night movie. Sammy arrives and demands that Orlok hand over his script and they both watch the movie together. Over drinks, Sammy again tries to convince Orlok to appear in his latest film because the script that he wrote will cast Orlok as a real-life person rather then a bogeyman. But the bitter Orlok announces that he is still fed up with the film business and shows Sammy that people are more frighted by the latest newspaper headings about crimes committed by random people then horror films. Sammy gets so drunk that he attempts to leave, but collapses and Orlok puts him in his own bed and soon afterwords also collapses drunk next to Sammy.Meanwhile at the Thompson house, Bobby is sitting alone in his bedroom chain smoking when Ilene returns home. His tone of voice is now very cold and he asks her not to turn on the lights because he has a headache. When she asks him what he wanted to talk to her about and why he is perplexed, he no longer wants to talk and asks her to go to bed.The next morning, after his father has apparently left for work, Bobby types out a note and when Ilene walks in the room, he suddenly takes out his .45 caliber gun and violently shoots her dead. When Bobby's mother runs into the room, he shoots her dead too. He then shoots an unfortunate grocery delivery man who enters the house. Bobby hides the bodies in rooms through the house, hides the bloodstains and leaves, leaving behind a note saying that he has killed his wife and mother and will continue killing until he is caught or killed.In Orlok's hotel suite, a hung-over Sammy wakes up and sees a sleeping Orlok next to him and jumps, waking him up. Sammy says that he was having a nightmare and woke up to see Byron Orlok. As Orlok gets up to answer a knock on his front door, he passes a mirror and he too jumps from his own reflection. Jenny has arrived with Orlok's internary with his airline tickets to New York as well as his tickets for the ship to take him back to England. However, Orlok finally agrees to make the final promotional appearance at the Racine Drive-In that evening for the premier of his latest film.Across town, Bobby arrives at another gun store and asks for 300 rounds of ammunition for his new rifle as well as box of 12-gauge buckshot for his double-barreled shotgun. Despite the fact that Bobby looks a little jittery and of the unusually large quantity of ammunition requested, the clerk sells him the ammunition. When the clerk asks Bobby about the order, Bobby tells him that he is going out to ""shoot some pigs.""In Orlok's hotel suite, he, Jenny, Sammy along with a brash radio disk jockey named Kip Larkin (Sandy Baron) discuss his appearance at the drive-in theater for that night and Orlok decides to reherse to them a ghost story that he plans to tell after the movie premier.Meanwhile, Bobby drives to an industrial center and after parking his car, pulls out of the trunk all of his guns in a large pouch and enters an abandoned amusement park that sits next to an oil storage tank facility where he scales a cynderblock wall and climbs up the stairs of one of the oil tanks that sits alongside a busy freeway. Bobby lays out all of his rifles and pistols that he brought with him as if displaying them for himself and then eats a sandwich and drinks soda pop that he also brought before taking am with his new high-powered rifle at motorists traveling along the road and opens fire, killing and/or wounding many in which some cars veer off the road. An oil company worker investigates the shooting, but Bobby kills him too with a blast from his shotgun as he is reloading. When Bobby hears police sirens and sees police cars approaching on the freeway, he grabs most of his guns and runs down the stairs and back to his car, but drops several of his weapons including his .45 pistol, an unused .44 magnum revolver, as well as his shotgun and a rifle and some boxes of ammunition. As Bobby drives away, a police car appears and give chase, but he eludes it by driving into the very same drive-in theater that is showing Orlok's 'The Terror' for that night. After reloading and having a meal from the concession stand, Bobby carries his remaining guns in his US Army pouch and walks through a door leading to the big screen.When it gets dark and the movie finally goes on, Bobby climbs up the structure and begins to shoot the viewers through a small hole in the screen. He first shoots a man in a telephone booth and then shoots people in their cars, on by one. He even shoots and kills the projectionist. Orlok arrives for his special appearance and the limo parks close to the screen. Meanwhile, many viewers start to leave because they realize that there is a sniper present. A traffic jam ensues. When Bobby pauses to reload, he accidentally knocks over his last few boxes of ammunition. Panicking, Bobby climbs down the screen and tries to retrieve the ammo from a drainage but without success.Some male viewers take guns from the trunks of their cars and charge towards the screen. Seeing the vigilante mob approach, Bobby runs to an area to the side of the screen and opens fire randomly. One of his shots seriously injures Jenny as she gets out of the limo. The police soon arrive as does Sammy and they try to find both Orlok and the sniper. Orlok angrily walks towards the screen as Bobby finally runs out of ammunition for his rifle and opens fire with one of his smaller pistols. He gets confused when he sees the Orlok character on the drive-in screen walking towards him and sees the real Orlok walking to him as well. Bobby first shoots Orlok, but misses and only gazes his forehead with the bullet. Bobby takes aim and shoots at the Orlok on the big screen. Blinded by police searchlights zeroing in on him, Bobby fires widely until he runs out of ammo. When Bobby takes out another one of his pistols, Orlok rushes up and knocks the gun out of Bobby's hand with his walking cane and beats Bobby with it as well as literally slapping him into submission. Bobby then cowers in fear as Orlok says, ""Is that what I was afraid of?"" Two policemen run up to the screen and arrest Bobby. As he is being led away, Bobby says to his police captors, ""I hardly ever missed, did I?"" Bobby is taken away in a police car while Sammy tends to Orlok and takes him away in his limo as the crowd of people and cars file out of the drive in theater.The final shot shows the deserted drive in theater the morning after which is now empty, except for Bobby's white car sitting alone in the empty lot as the end credits silently roll.","

After Ilene leaves and his parents go to bed for the night, Bobby goes to his car and takes out one of his guns, a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol before returning to the house.At Orlok's hotel room, he orders room service and watches himself on one of his old movies 'The Criminal Code' that is playing as a late-night movie. Sammy arrives and demands that Orlok hand over his script and they both watch the movie together. Over drinks, Sammy again tries to convince Orlok to appear in his latest film because the script that he wrote will cast Orlok as a real-life person rather then a bogeyman. But the bitter Orlok announces that he is still fed up with the film business and shows Sammy that people are more frighted by the latest newspaper headings about crimes committed by random people then horror films. Sammy gets so drunk that he attempts to leave, but collapses and Orlok puts him in his own bed and soon afterwords also collapses drunk next to Sammy.Meanwhile at the Thompson house, Bobby is sitting alone in his bedroom chain smoking when Ilene returns home. His tone of voice is now very cold and he asks her not to turn on the lights because he has a headache. When she asks him what he wanted to talk to her about and why he is perplexed, he no longer wants to talk and asks her to go to bed.The next morning, after his father has apparently left for work, Bobby types out a note and when Ilene walks in the room, he suddenly takes out his .45 caliber gun and violently shoots her dead. When Bobby's mother runs into the room, he shoots her dead too. He then shoots an unfortunate grocery delivery man who enters the house. Bobby hides the bodies in rooms through the house, hides the bloodstains and leaves, leaving behind a note saying that he has killed his wife and mother and will continue killing until he is caught or killed.In Orlok's hotel suite, a hung-over Sammy wakes up and sees a sleeping Orlok next to him and jumps, waking him up. Sammy says that he was having a nightmare and woke up to see Byron Orlok. As Orlok gets up to answer a knock on his front door, he passes a mirror and he too jumps from his own reflection. Jenny has arrived with Orlok's internary with his airline tickets to New York as well as his tickets for the ship to take him back to England. However, Orlok finally agrees to make the final promotional appearance at the Racine Drive-In that evening for the premier of his latest film.Across town, Bobby arrives at another gun store and asks for 300 rounds of ammunition for his new rifle as well as box of 12-gauge buckshot for his double-barreled shotgun. Despite the fact that Bobby looks a little jittery and of the unusually large quantity of ammunition requested, the clerk sells him the ammunition. When the clerk asks Bobby about the order, Bobby tells him that he is going out to ""shoot some pigs.""In Orlok's hotel suite, he, Jenny, Sammy along with a brash radio disk jockey named Kip Larkin (Sandy Baron) discuss his appearance at the drive-in theater for that night and Orlok decides to reherse to them a ghost story that he plans to tell after the movie premier.Meanwhile, Bobby drives to an industrial center and after parking his car, pulls out of the trunk all of his guns in a large pouch and enters an abandoned amusement park that sits next to an oil storage tank facility where he scales a cynderblock wall and climbs up the stairs of one of the oil tanks that sits alongside a busy freeway. Bobby lays out all of his rifles and pistols that he brought with him as if displaying them for himself and then eats a sandwich and drinks soda pop that he also brought before taking am with his new high-powered rifle at motorists traveling along the road and opens fire, killing and/or wounding many in which some cars veer off the road. An oil company worker investigates the shooting, but Bobby kills him too with a blast from his shotgun as he is reloading. When Bobby hears police sirens and sees police cars approaching on the freeway, he grabs most of his guns and runs down the stairs and back to his car, but drops several of his weapons including his .45 pistol, an unused .44 magnum revolver, as well as his shotgun and a rifle and some boxes of ammunition. As Bobby drives away, a police car appears and give chase, but he eludes it by driving into the very same drive-in theater that is showing Orlok's 'The Terror' for that night. After reloading and having a meal from the concession stand, Bobby carries his remaining guns in his US Army pouch and walks through a door leading to the big screen.When it gets dark and the movie finally goes on, Bobby climbs up the structure and begins to shoot the viewers through a small hole in the screen. He first shoots a man in a telephone booth and then shoots people in their cars, on by one. He even shoots and kills the projectionist. Orlok arrives for his special appearance and the limo parks close to the screen. Meanwhile, many viewers start to leave because they realize that there is a sniper present. A traffic jam ensues. When Bobby pauses to reload, he accidentally knocks over his last few boxes of ammunition. Panicking, Bobby climbs down the screen and tries to retrieve the ammo from a drainage but without success.Some male viewers take guns from the trunks of their cars and charge towards the screen. Seeing the vigilante mob approach, Bobby runs to an area to the side of the screen and opens fire randomly. One of his shots seriously injures Jenny as she gets out of the limo. The police soon arrive as does Sammy and they try to find both Orlok and the sniper. Orlok angrily walks towards the screen as Bobby finally runs out of ammunition for his rifle and opens fire with one of his smaller pistols. He gets confused when he sees the Orlok character on the drive-in screen walking towards him and sees the real Orlok walking to him as well. Bobby first shoots Orlok, but misses and only gazes his forehead with the bullet. Bobby takes aim and shoots at the Orlok on the big screen. Blinded by police searchlights zeroing in on him, Bobby fires widely until he runs out of ammo. When Bobby takes out another one of his pistols, Orlok rushes up and knocks the gun out of Bobby's hand with his walking cane and beats Bobby with it as well as literally slapping him into submission. Bobby then cowers in fear as Orlok says, ""Is that what I was afraid of?"" Two policemen run up to the screen and arrest Bobby. As he is being led away, Bobby says to his police captors, ""I hardly ever missed, did I?"" Bobby is taken away in a police car while Sammy tends to Orlok and takes him away in his limo as the crowd of people and cars file out of the drive in theater.The final shot shows the deserted drive in theater the morning after which is now empty, except for Bobby's white car sitting alone in the empty lot as the end credits silently roll.

Following war logic, each time the crafty Japanese devises something useful, he guards it to deny its use to the Yank, who then steals it, its proceeds or the idea and/or ruins it. Yet each gets his chance to kill and/or capture the other, but neither pushes this to the end. After a while of this pointless pestering, they end up joining forces to build and man a raft...

    This taut, very very exciting adventure, takes place in the Congo, where buddy mercenaries Curry (Rod Taylor) and Ruffo (James Brown) are hired by a shaky government president, to go deep into the jungle and retrieve uncut diamonds from a diamond mine that the president needs, to sustain his government!Selection of a crack troop of soldiers, and reluctantly -- a pro-Nazi officer to lead them under Curry's command, heighten the adventure by train into the jungles, threatened and under siege by Simbas...The exciting train ride into forbidden territory under scrutiny by NATO, eventually finds them at the mining site, to find the diamonds safely in a timed vault - not set to open for several hours yet - with the Simbas due at the perimeter - at about the same time!!!Tensions rise as they wait out the hours for the vault to time out. As the Simbas begin their attack, the vault clicks open, and all scamper to the waiting train with the diamonds.As they leave the site, a mortar explodes, hits the train, and separates a train car full of mine employees. The train car glides back into the hands of the Simbas... with the diamonds!!! Another mortar hits the tracks and the train engine capsizes...Now it's up to Curry and Ruffo to infiltrate the Simba encampment, and retrieve the diamonds! They do so successfully and begin their journey back to civilization, in vehicles with a short supply of gasoline. But the mean, vengeful Henlien (Peter Carsten) - has other ideas. He wants the diamonds for himself!!!From the jacket for the film:The year: 1964. The place: the blood-soaked Congo during the struggle for its independence from Belgium. The job: take a train 300 miles through dangerous Simba rebel territory to rescue 62 refugees and retrieve $50 million in uncut diamonds. Time allowed: 3 days. Chances for survival: slim...To soldier of fortune Bruce Curry (Rod Taylor), the assignment means a chance for a handsome $50,000 payday! To his partner, Ruffo (Jim Brown), it means returning to his homeland to help his people. But no matter what the motive, the result is one heck of a tough, raw action-adventure spectacle!With nary a moment free from anbushes, air attacks, and torture scenes -- there's even a chain saw duel -- director Jack Cardiff ""keeps the action ablaze by setting off the most gawd-awful explosions of violence in many a moon"" (Playboy).Brimming with cataclysmic intensity and well-orchestrated mayhem, Dark Of The Sun - like kindred film The Dirty Dozen -- achieves its particular potency by revealing depths of characeter and touches of humanity -- even nobility -- which enhance the spectacularly photographed roughneck action!
--------A rare film if you can get it -- was photographed in CinemaScope -- but only available in full screen on VHS...If you know where I can get in in Cinemascope, contact me at sekjr@juno.com

                    Of Glocca Morra, Ireland, Finian McLongeran, who has his own unique belief system of Irish legends, uproots himself and his adult daughter, Sharon McLonergan, and heads for the mythical land of Rainbow Valley, Missitucky, USA where he believes he will become rich. One of those beliefs is that burying a crock of gold in Rainbow Valley will make it multiply, due to the power of rainbows and the Valley's close proximity to Fort Knox. Finian considers that he ""borrowed"" the crock of gold he has from the leprechauns of Glocca Morra, which he plans to return once he makes his fortune. Little does he know that in taking the gold, the leprechauns can no longer make wishes come true and are slowly turning mortal. One of those leprechauns, Og, has come to retrieve the crock of gold to save himself and his fellow leprechauns. Finian and Sharon's arrival in Rainbow Valley coincides with the return of the Valley's prodigal son, Woody Mahoney, who has come to repay back taxes before his land is auctioned off. Woody's sister, Susan Mahoney, is referred to by most Susan the Silent, as she has never spoken and communicates primarily through dance. In helping the Mahoneys repay those taxes, Finian only asks for a small parcel of that land for him and Sharon, and mostly for a place to bury the crock of gold. With the rest of the land, Woody and his friend, Howard, a research botanist, plan to revolutionize the tobacco industry by growing the first ever mentholated tobacco plants, which is a little more difficult to accomplish than they initially believe. Much like Finian, Woody plans on getting rich the easy way, in Woody's case off the hard work of Howard. Regardless of Sharon's dislike of what Woody is doing by being what she considers a schemer, the two fall in love. Finian's assistance of Woody in keeping the land irks bigoted Senator Billboard Rawkins, who has been trying to buy up as much land in the Valley as possible. Complications ensue for all involved because of the crock of gold, even though most have not seen it or even know it exists for real.

The town has its own resident dreamer, Woody Mahoney, who thinks that he might be able to put the town on the map by crossing mint with tobacco so that it'll grow already mentholated. Finian's come to the town because he's stolen a leprechaun's crock of gold and plans to plant it in the ground so it'll grow faster (or else why would the Americans have rushed to dig the gold out of California only to plant it back in the ground at Fort Knox?). But trouble arrives in the form of Og the leprechaun, who has followed Finian to America and is bent on retrieving his gold. Meanwhile, the bigoted Senator Billboard Rawkins, in an effort to stop progress in his state in the form of a new dam and hydroelectric system, plans to take the remaining parcel of land needed to stop the project - Woody's, which Finian has purchased to save from the auctioneer's gavel. But then the government's geologists reveal to the Senator that gold has been detected on the property! Rawkins and his men confront the sharecroppers to seize their land using as an excuse an obscure law making it a felony for blacks and whites to live together, but when Sharon, outraged at this bigotry, cries out while standing right over the pot of gold, ""I wish to God you were black ..."" all hell breaks loose as wishes come true.

"68","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063452/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Dr. Jim Tanner has always been an expert on human endurance. As the film opens, he is the chairman of a committee of scientists, based at the laboratory of the Space Research Commission in San Marino, CA, tasked to find the limits of human endurance, and those factors that could best enable a human being, say a prospective space pilot, to survive extreme stress and to make instant decisions that could save his life in an emergency. But never before has Tanner found himself pushed to the limits of his own endurance.On a day like any other, Mr. Arthur Nordlund, US Naval liaison, visits his laboratory and observes some of Tanner's work, as four test subjects are undergoing endurance tests of direct neural stimulation, immersion in freezing-cold water, extreme heat, and high acceleration in a centrifuge. Though impressed, Nordlund is skeptical of the expense, though Tanner seeks to assure him that the work is necessary to the continued viability of the US space program. Biologist Talbot Scott interrupts Tanner, asks to talk with him privately, and warns him that another of their colleagues, anthropologist Henry Hallston, is scheduled to present his report on his human-intelligence survey, and is somehow convinced that all the committee members are ""being watched."" Scott is afraid that Hallston will embarrass the Committee in front of Nordlund, who is scheduled to attend.Tanner cannot put off Nordlund, so when the Committee sits, Tanner tries to put off Hallston instead. But Hallston will not be put off. His survey, in which the Committee members participated, reveals that one member--unidentified because the questionnaires were coded--is an unmeasurable genius, so much so that his genius might reward him with preternatural powers that others would be helpless to resist. The other members are openly skeptical, and Tanner despairs of the impression that Hallston is making in front of Nordlund, but Nordlund wants to hear more--and the laboratory's chief administrator, Norman E. Van Zandt, insists on allowing Hallston to have his say, if only to falsify his seemingly outrageous theories. But when physicist Carl Melniker sets up a test of telekinesis by placing a sheet of notepaper on an improvised spindle, and Hallston insists that everyone in the room try together to make the paper spin without touching it, the incredible happens: the paper does spin, slowly at first, then faster and faster.Tanner is inclined to ignore the whole thing, but his colleague and paramour, geneticist Margery Lansing, is not so sure. She asserts that such a genius could be born today. Then the telephone interrupts them, and at the other end is a frantic Sally Hallston who tells Tanner that her husband had gone to the lab to pick up his questionnaires and had not returned home.(In fact, Hallston has gone to his office, but never made it out. Someone--presumably the unidentified genius--has impressed on Hallston's mind that the knee-level swinging door has become a gate taller than he, and then a solid wall. After that, Hallston has suffered a heart attack and collapsed at his desk.)Reluctantly, Tanner drives back to the lab, with Marge in tow. Together they look over Hallston's office, which is unusual in appearance except for some signs that someone has fallen over the desk and spilled some papers. Among the papers, Tanner finds a memo sheet with the name ""Adam Hart"" scrawled on it. As he is trying to figure out who that person might be, they overhear the centrifuge starting up. Tanner and Marge rush to the centrifuge control room but cannot stop the centrifuge. Tanner rushes down the hallway to pull the main switch, and together he and Marge wait for the centrifuge to stop, and then open it. There they find Hallston, dead, his eyes and tongue still protruding from the high-acceleration forces he has suffered.The next day, a police detective oversees the removal of Hallston's body and interviews Tanner. That is when things begin to go seriously wrong for Tanner. First, the centrifuge's controls now work properly, contrary to Tanner's story (and experience). Then, the detective and Dr. Van Zandt both accuse Tanner of academic fraud, after Tanner's degree-granting colleges and graduate schools disavow any memory of his having ever enrolled, much less graduated. Then Talbot Scott abruptly refuses to have anything to say to Tanner, this although they had had a friendly conversation only five minutes before. Forced to resign his position, Tanner leaves the laboratory, but not before the detective hints to him that he is now a ""person of interest"" in what is now a murder investigation.Unable to figure out what to do next, Tanner wanders aimlessly in the tourist section of San Marino, only to have more weird experiences. A water-dipping bird on display abruptly straightens up, winks at him, then drinks from the water glass and spits at him. In another display window, a company of toy soldiers march smartly into formation, unlimber their muskets, aim at him, and fire! Then he tries to cross the street, but the pedestrian-traffic signal changes its message from DON'T WALK to DON'T RUN. He runs from the intersection and into a fun house, where he finds himself on an empty carousel (with a horse that winks at him) that begins to spin as fast as the centrifuge, and the carousel operator has to pull a main switch of his own to stop it and get Tanner off.By now, Tanner has had it. He realizes that someone who was at that Committee meeting has set him up. That person, presumably the mysterious Adam Hart, first murdered Hallston, then framed Tanner with the murder, somehow erased Tanner's academic record, and just now tried to kill him--but for a reason that escapes Tanner, failed. Tanner does not want to wait for another murder attempt, but decides to track Adam Hart down himself.He goes to Joshua Flats, CA, Hallston's hometown, and starts asking questions about Hart, first of a local cafe waitress (who seems unusually romantically interested in Tanner, a thing that also happened to him in the tourist section, but to which he paid no attention), and then of Hallston's parents. The witnesses variously describe Hart, who had been Hallston's schoolmate, as a genius and a sexual magnet. Then the local fill-up station operator offers to take Tanner to Hart's old hangout--but instead dumps Tanner in the middle of the desert next to an Air Force firing range. Tanner is nearly killed again when a squadron of Air Force jets starts strafing the range. He escapes only because he has the presence of mind to light a fire in the brush on the range, prompting the pilots to break off. Furious, he returns to the fill-up station, bursts into the operator's bedroom, and interrogates the operator, who confesses that Adam Hart gave him a standing order ten years earlier to kill any person who dared make inquiries about him. That this operator would blindly obey such a dangerous order after all these years only convinces Tanner further that he is dealing with an assassin with the very preternatural abilities that Hallston most feared. Now he knows the reason for Hallston's attitude: Hallston, having grown up with Hart, had felt instinctively that Hart was a very dangerous person. But Hallston is dead, and Tanner is now Hart's target.Tanner next goes to see Hallston's widow, who is no help. She now doesn't remember the name Adam Hart (though she had said that Hallston had mentioned him once), doesn't remember what her late husband looked like, and doesn't even remember Tanner, though for some weird reason she also seems romantically interested in him, though Tanner puts that down to her being drunk. Next he goes to the home of Margery Lansing, but is violently attacked by Carl Melniker, who earlier has invaded Marge's home, bound her, and lain in wait for Tanner, thinking him to be the unknown genius who had killed Hallston. Tanner manages to subdue Melniker long enough to convince him that he means him no harm, and unbinds Marge. The three scientists then try to have a rational discussion about what they're facing, and how to combat it--or survive it. The three decide that for now they don't dare fall asleep, so they drive to a hotel in nearby Santa Lisa, that his hosting a salesmen's convention, and in effect, crash the party. While there, Tanner sees a newspaper with several copies bearing a partial headline: DON'T RUN! This turns out to be part of a legitimate headline--but why the newspaper would run a banner headline about the city's mayor telling an opposing candidate not to run against him seems most strange. Later, despite their best efforts, Melniker winds up dead, and Tanner and Marge have to flee.Tanner and Marge next drive to the apartment complex where Arthur Nordlund lives. As they drive into the parking garage, they notice Nordlund abruptly suffering an apparent heart attack and then stumbling into an elevator. The elevator starts to go up, then starts back down, then gets stuck between floors. Tanner climbs to the top floor, enters the elevator shaft, and tries to climb down to the elevator by rapelling down the cable--but then the elevator starts to go up, threatening to crush Tanner. Tanner quickly lets himself down to the elevator cab, opens the trap door, enters the cab, and finds Nordlund, who is near death.Now that Hallston and Melniker are dead, Nordlund seems to have been attacked himself, and Tanner trusts Marge implicitly, Tanner now narrows his list of suspects to Van Zandt and Scott. Nordlund, who has now joined their group, urges a homicidal counterstrike against the unknown genius, but Tanner does not wish to kill a man indiscriminately, not without knowing which man is the right man. Tanner then visits Van Zandt's home, but succeeds only in speaking to Mrs. Van Zandt before realizing that Dr.Van Zandt suspects Tanner of murder. Then Tanner barely escapes alive when someone (not Norman Van Zandt) tries to run him down. He drives away, only to find himself in an out-of-control car with brakes that don't hold. He splashes into a river and escapes by unfastening the car's convertible top, and then is picked up by police. They take him to a hospital, where the detective first tells him that he is under arrest--for the murders of Dr. and Mrs. Van Zandt, who have died when their house burned down shortly after his visit to it. The detective also informs him that Nordlund has disappeared.Then comes word that Talbot Scott has locked himself in the auditorium at the laboratory, is armed, and has demanded to see Tanner. Tanner insists that he can talk to Scott and reason with him, and reluctantly the detective lets Tanner go to the laboratory. There he listens incredulously as Scott babbles disconnectedly about Tanner being the genius, and Scott's willingness to serve Tanner however he wishes if only Tanner will not kill him. In the end, the out-of-control Scott dies in a gun battle with police.At last Tanner realizes who is responsible for his set-up and the murders of his colleagues: Arthur Nordlund, otherwise known as Adam Hart. Instead of running, Tanner walks the corridor and looks at some notes that someone had left, concerning the effect of intense pain on the heart. Marge then reveals herself, telling Tanner that she is glad that he has stopped running and will now stand and fight--because she, too, realizes that Nordlund is responsible.Tanner confronts Nordlund directly in the corridor of the laboratory. Nordlund then unleashes his full telepathic fury against Tanner, seeking to hypnotize him into believing himself plunged into freezing cold, then searing heat, and finally into the unforgiving void of outer space.

    Synopsis
    Dr. Jim Tanner has always been an expert on human endurance. As the film opens, he is the chairman of a committee of scientists, based at the laboratory of the Space Research Commission in San Marino, CA, tasked to find the limits of human endurance, and those factors that could best enable a human being, say a prospective space pilot, to survive extreme stress and to make instant decisions that could save his life in an emergency. But never before has Tanner found himself pushed to the limits of his own endurance.On a day like any other, Mr. Arthur Nordlund, US Naval liaison, visits his laboratory and observes some of Tanner's work, as four test subjects are undergoing endurance tests of direct neural stimulation, immersion in freezing-cold water, extreme heat, and high acceleration in a centrifuge. Though impressed, Nordlund is skeptical of the expense, though Tanner seeks to assure him that the work is necessary to the continued viability of the US space program. Biologist Talbot Scott interrupts Tanner, asks to talk with him privately, and warns him that another of their colleagues, anthropologist Henry Hallston, is scheduled to present his report on his human-intelligence survey, and is somehow convinced that all the committee members are ""being watched."" Scott is afraid that Hallston will embarrass the Committee in front of Nordlund, who is scheduled to attend.Tanner cannot put off Nordlund, so when the Committee sits, Tanner tries to put off Hallston instead. But Hallston will not be put off. His survey, in which the Committee members participated, reveals that one member--unidentified because the questionnaires were coded--is an unmeasurable genius, so much so that his genius might reward him with preternatural powers that others would be helpless to resist. The other members are openly skeptical, and Tanner despairs of the impression that Hallston is making in front of Nordlund, but Nordlund wants to hear more--and the laboratory's chief administrator, Norman E. Van Zandt, insists on allowing Hallston to have his say, if only to falsify his seemingly outrageous theories. But when physicist Carl Melniker sets up a test of telekinesis by placing a sheet of notepaper on an improvised spindle, and Hallston insists that everyone in the room try together to make the paper spin without touching it, the incredible happens: the paper does spin, slowly at first, then faster and faster.Tanner is inclined to ignore the whole thing, but his colleague and paramour, geneticist Margery Lansing, is not so sure. She asserts that such a genius could be born today. Then the telephone interrupts them, and at the other end is a frantic Sally Hallston who tells Tanner that her husband had gone to the lab to pick up his questionnaires and had not returned home.(In fact, Hallston has gone to his office, but never made it out. Someone--presumably the unidentified genius--has impressed on Hallston's mind that the knee-level swinging door has become a gate taller than he, and then a solid wall. After that, Hallston has suffered a heart attack and collapsed at his desk.)Reluctantly, Tanner drives back to the lab, with Marge in tow. Together they look over Hallston's office, which is unusual in appearance except for some signs that someone has fallen over the desk and spilled some papers. Among the papers, Tanner finds a memo sheet with the name ""Adam Hart"" scrawled on it. As he is trying to figure out who that person might be, they overhear the centrifuge starting up. Tanner and Marge rush to the centrifuge control room but cannot stop the centrifuge. Tanner rushes down the hallway to pull the main switch, and together he and Marge wait for the centrifuge to stop, and then open it. There they find Hallston, dead, his eyes and tongue still protruding from the high-acceleration forces he has suffered.The next day, a police detective oversees the removal of Hallston's body and interviews Tanner. That is when things begin to go seriously wrong for Tanner. First, the centrifuge's controls now work properly, contrary to Tanner's story (and experience). Then, the detective and Dr. Van Zandt both accuse Tanner of academic fraud, after Tanner's degree-granting colleges and graduate schools disavow any memory of his having ever enrolled, much less graduated. Then Talbot Scott abruptly refuses to have anything to say to Tanner, this although they had had a friendly conversation only five minutes before. Forced to resign his position, Tanner leaves the laboratory, but not before the detective hints to him that he is now a ""person of interest"" in what is now a murder investigation.Unable to figure out what to do next, Tanner wanders aimlessly in the tourist section of San Marino, only to have more weird experiences. A water-dipping bird on display abruptly straightens up, winks at him, then drinks from the water glass and spits at him. In another display window, a company of toy soldiers march smartly into formation, unlimber their muskets, aim at him, and fire! Then he tries to cross the street, but the pedestrian-traffic signal changes its message from DON'T WALK to DON'T RUN. He runs from the intersection and into a fun house, where he finds himself on an empty carousel (with a horse that winks at him) that begins to spin as fast as the centrifuge, and the carousel operator has to pull a main switch of his own to stop it and get Tanner off.By now, Tanner has had it. He realizes that someone who was at that Committee meeting has set him up. That person, presumably the mysterious Adam Hart, first murdered Hallston, then framed Tanner with the murder, somehow erased Tanner's academic record, and just now tried to kill him--but for a reason that escapes Tanner, failed. Tanner does not want to wait for another murder attempt, but decides to track Adam Hart down himself.He goes to Joshua Flats, CA, Hallston's hometown, and starts asking questions about Hart, first of a local cafe waitress (who seems unusually romantically interested in Tanner, a thing that also happened to him in the tourist section, but to which he paid no attention), and then of Hallston's parents. The witnesses variously describe Hart, who had been Hallston's schoolmate, as a genius and a sexual magnet. Then the local fill-up station operator offers to take Tanner to Hart's old hangout--but instead dumps Tanner in the middle of the desert next to an Air Force firing range. Tanner is nearly killed again when a squadron of Air Force jets starts strafing the range. He escapes only because he has the presence of mind to light a fire in the brush on the range, prompting the pilots to break off. Furious, he returns to the fill-up station, bursts into the operator's bedroom, and interrogates the operator, who confesses that Adam Hart gave him a standing order ten years earlier to kill any person who dared make inquiries about him. That this operator would blindly obey such a dangerous order after all these years only convinces Tanner further that he is dealing with an assassin with the very preternatural abilities that Hallston most feared. Now he knows the reason for Hallston's attitude: Hallston, having grown up with Hart, had felt instinctively that Hart was a very dangerous person. But Hallston is dead, and Tanner is now Hart's target.Tanner next goes to see Hallston's widow, who is no help. She now doesn't remember the name Adam Hart (though she had said that Hallston had mentioned him once), doesn't remember what her late husband looked like, and doesn't even remember Tanner, though for some weird reason she also seems romantically interested in him, though Tanner puts that down to her being drunk. Next he goes to the home of Margery Lansing, but is violently attacked by Carl Melniker, who earlier has invaded Marge's home, bound her, and lain in wait for Tanner, thinking him to be the unknown genius who had killed Hallston. Tanner manages to subdue Melniker long enough to convince him that he means him no harm, and unbinds Marge. The three scientists then try to have a rational discussion about what they're facing, and how to combat it--or survive it. The three decide that for now they don't dare fall asleep, so they drive to a hotel in nearby Santa Lisa, that his hosting a salesmen's convention, and in effect, crash the party. While there, Tanner sees a newspaper with several copies bearing a partial headline: DON'T RUN! This turns out to be part of a legitimate headline--but why the newspaper would run a banner headline about the city's mayor telling an opposing candidate not to run against him seems most strange. Later, despite their best efforts, Melniker winds up dead, and Tanner and Marge have to flee.Tanner and Marge next drive to the apartment complex where Arthur Nordlund lives. As they drive into the parking garage, they notice Nordlund abruptly suffering an apparent heart attack and then stumbling into an elevator. The elevator starts to go up, then starts back down, then gets stuck between floors. Tanner climbs to the top floor, enters the elevator shaft, and tries to climb down to the elevator by rapelling down the cable--but then the elevator starts to go up, threatening to crush Tanner. Tanner quickly lets himself down to the elevator cab, opens the trap door, enters the cab, and finds Nordlund, who is near death.Now that Hallston and Melniker are dead, Nordlund seems to have been attacked himself, and Tanner trusts Marge implicitly, Tanner now narrows his list of suspects to Van Zandt and Scott. Nordlund, who has now joined their group, urges a homicidal counterstrike against the unknown genius, but Tanner does not wish to kill a man indiscriminately, not without knowing which man is the right man. Tanner then visits Van Zandt's home, but succeeds only in speaking to Mrs. Van Zandt before realizing that Dr.Van Zandt suspects Tanner of murder. Then Tanner barely escapes alive when someone (not Norman Van Zandt) tries to run him down. He drives away, only to find himself in an out-of-control car with brakes that don't hold. He splashes into a river and escapes by unfastening the car's convertible top, and then is picked up by police. They take him to a hospital, where the detective first tells him that he is under arrest--for the murders of Dr. and Mrs. Van Zandt, who have died when their house burned down shortly after his visit to it. The detective also informs him that Nordlund has disappeared.Then comes word that Talbot Scott has locked himself in the auditorium at the laboratory, is armed, and has demanded to see Tanner. Tanner insists that he can talk to Scott and reason with him, and reluctantly the detective lets Tanner go to the laboratory. There he listens incredulously as Scott babbles disconnectedly about Tanner being the genius, and Scott's willingness to serve Tanner however he wishes if only Tanner will not kill him. In the end, the out-of-control Scott dies in a gun battle with police.At last Tanner realizes who is responsible for his set-up and the murders of his colleagues: Arthur Nordlund, otherwise known as Adam Hart. Instead of running, Tanner walks the corridor and looks at some notes that someone had left, concerning the effect of intense pain on the heart. Marge then reveals herself, telling Tanner that she is glad that he has stopped running and will now stand and fight--because she, too, realizes that Nordlund is responsible.Tanner confronts Nordlund directly in the corridor of the laboratory. Nordlund then unleashes his full telepathic fury against Tanner, seeking to hypnotize him into believing himself plunged into freezing cold, then searing heat, and finally into the unforgiving void of outer space. Somehow Tanner survives, though he physically collapses--but does not black out. Now he knows why Nordlund/Hart wanted him dead: there are in fact not one genius, but two: Adam Hart and himself! Now he fights back directly, and kills Nordlund by telekinetically squeezing his heart and holding it compressed.Marge tells Tanner, in wonderment, that she ought to have suspected earlier: Adam Hart would never have revealed himself by making the paper spin at the original meeting, and everyone else (except Van Zandt) had tried individually to spin the paper and failed, so therefore Tanner had been the genius all along. Nordlund had tried to kill Tanner after deciding that the world wasn't big enough for two such geniuses, and had eliminated his colleagues to dispose of all possible witnesses (except for Marge, perhaps because he hadn't had a chance to eliminate her yet). Now that Tanner realizes the kind of genius that he is, he and Marge leave the laboratory, with Tanner speculating idly on whether his newfound power will corrupt him--and unable to answer his own question.

                    Thirty-five year old spinster and virgin Rachel Cameron is a sad, lonely woman. She lives in the small town of Japonica, Connecticut where she grew up. She teaches second grade at Japonica Elementary School and lives with her highly demanding widowed mother (her funeral director father passed away fourteen years ago) in the same apartment above a funeral home where she grew up, despite the home now not owned by them. Rachel often uses her mother as an excuse not to do things. Rachel represses her emotions, and is prone to daydreaming to envision alternate paths for herself in certain situations if she only had the nerve to do those things. Even when Nick Kazlik, a childhood acquaintance who has returned to Japonica for a summer visit with his family, makes it clear that he wants to have fun with her while he's in town, she can't act on his request out of fear of the unknown. But after a couple of incidents with her only real friend Calla Mackie, who is a fellow teacher at the school, Rachel begins to allow herself more freedom. But as Rachel's repressions slowly melt away, how her emotions will manifest themselves becomes the question.

Each month, Sara selects from her lodgers a new lover - but only on the condition that he will let their affair end when the month expires. When Charlie Blake, a box manufacturer and her lover-of-the-month, falls in love with her, he is unwilling to give her up. Sara insists, even though it is obvious that she too has fallen in love. As the month runs out, Charlie searches desperately for the key to Sara's persistence. What he discovers provides the haunting climax to this love story.

                    It's late October in New York City. Despite their inauspicious initial meeting (she made him have to rewrite his driver's examination) and the fact that he doesn't seem really to understand anything about which she is talking, Englishman Charlie Blake is attracted to seemingly eccentric twenty-two year old Sara Deever. After they get to know a little about each other, Sara suggests to him that he become her ""November"". She takes a different man - someone who she perceives has a problem that needs fixing - every calendar month to rehabilitate him. The man lives with her in her Brooklyn Heights apartment for that month and they do almost everything together, albeit with the understanding that at the stroke of midnight on the last day he is to leave without question. She feels that Charlie's business (he owns a box making company), the fact that he only wears three-piece suits and that he seems fixated on time are a manifestation of an unknown problem. Beyond subletting apartments for a profit, these rehabilitation sessions are Sara's main job. Despite not thinking he himself has a problem, Charlie agrees to be ""November"" if only to get to know her. As November proceeds, the two get to know each other - for him which includes meeting a few of his predecessors, learning about Sara's potential ""December"", and meeting her older vegetarian friend Alonzo who seems to be her protector - and truly fall for each other. But will Sara break her rule with Charlie of one month only, especially in light of the reason that she has taken on these rehabilitation tasks in the first place?

                    Poor Luci, she is a 15 year old English schoolgirl about to embark on a promising career as the high-school mattress when she comes home one day from school to find her Mum as dead as a door knob in the tub. You see her Mum has cut her wrists after a long unrewarding career as the town mattress. Fortunately for Luci, her Mum's childhood friend is now a very successful upper-middle class doctor who has decided to take Luci home to his family (on a trial basis). Luci's new family (The Quayles) has a few issues. The father's libedo is on the wane and he has a stick permanently stuck up his butt. The mother was ""convent schooled"" and misses the good old days of snuggling up with a pretty young girl. The son is an amateur peeper without the libedo problem but also with a stick up his butt. Luci arrives in the midst of all this with her one suitcase, a bit unbalanced from her mother's recent suicide, and does everything she can to fit in with her new family - more or less. There isn't a whole lot of nudity or explicit sex. I've read that the film was originally given an ""X"" rating but don't let that fool you. This was 1968. Many films which would barely make an ""R"" rating today got an X in those days. In any event, it was released on video in the 1980s with an ""R"" rating and the copyright was abandoned in the U.S. in the mid 1990's. The video is ""Deleted"" in England.

                    Wealthy twenty-two year old Max Frost - born Max Jacob Flatow, Jr. - is a rock music superstar, he a rock music franchise unto himself. He has cut ties with his parents, especially due to the control wielded by his overbearing mother, Daphne Flatow, that control against which he rebelled and is still rebelling in the form of having an entourage solely of young people, who he believes knows better than people even a few years older than them. Age-wise, the senior member of his entourage is his acid-dropping girlfriend, former child star Sally LeRoy, age twenty-four, the junior member being fifteen year old Yale law graduate Billy Cage, his business advisor and his band's guitarist. Max decides to endorse thirty-seven year old Congressman Johnny Fergus, running on the Democratic ticket for a California senate seat, as one of Johnny's platform policies is to lower the voting age to eighteen. Johnny happily accepts that endorsement because of Max's power over young people, whose votes Johnny is trying to court. But as Max sees that Johnny doesn't go far enough in his policies - Max believing the voting age should be fourteen so someone like Billy can vote - Max figures the best way to get what he wants is to start his own political machine, first within the current regulations of the land, then once ""in"", working from the inside to change the laws to transfer the power from the ""old"" - who he and his team see as anyone over thirty-four - to the young. The questions become how far Max and his team will go to ensure his vision of the world comes to fruition, and how far the establishment will go to try and stop him and his followers.

"80","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063348/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Included throughout the film are various dances and routines actually used in the days of burlesque and they play as an important part in the movie as the actual plot itself.The story opens in 1925 with a young Amish girl, Rachel Schpitendavel (Britt Ekland) arriving in New York City. Rachel has dreamed of being a dancer from the time she was a little girl much to the displeasure of her strict, religious father, Jacob Schpitendavel (Harry Andrews). Rachel has run off to New York from her home in Pennsylvania to join the Minsky Burlesque show at the National Winter Garden Theater.Upon arriving at the theater she meets Professor Spats (Bert Lahr) a retired performer. He takes her into the theater to see the show. Rachel is excited about the dancing she sees, but seems clueless about most of the sexual innuendo in the performance. Spats promises her that after the show he will introduce her to the cast and Mr. Minsky.Bill Minsky (Elliott Gould), however, is having his own problems. Secretary for the Society for Decency, Vance Fowler (Denholm Elliott) is writing letters complaining about the show's skimpy costumes, suggestive dancing and bawdy humor. So far, Fowler has not convinced the police department to shutdown the show, but the letters have been disturbing to Louis Minsky (Joseph Wiseman), Bill's father. Louis owns the theater and leases it to Bill. He tells him he will not renew the lease when it expires next week. To continue the show Bill will have to buy the theater for $190,000. Bill tries to convince small time gangster and speakeasy owner Trim Houlihan (Forrest Tucker) to become partners with him and give him the money. Though Trim is a big fan of burlesque, he declines to invest.Word of the situation soon reaches the cast including the comedy team of funnyman Chick Williams (Norman Wisdom) and straight man Raymond Paine (Jason Robards). Chick is a decent, dependable, short guy who can't get a girl to take a second look at him, while Raymond is a handsome, untrustworthy womanizer that every girl adores. When Spats introduces Rachel to them, Chick is immediately taken with her while Raymond is unimpressed with her dancing specialty: interpreting stories from the Bible.After returning to his dressing room, however, Raymond gets an idea to save the show. He proposes putting Rachel into the midnight performance billed as ""Madam Fifi"" from Paris and start a rumor that she is will be doing a daring new erotic dance. This should be enough for Fowler to convince the police to raid the place. However, when the police and press appear and find only Rachel dancing her innocent Bible stories, Fowler will be discredited and cease to be a problem.Bill Minsky approves of the plan, though Chick is concerned that Rachel will be humiliated. The cast takes Rachel, their newest member, to lunch where she meets Trim Houlihan. It is clear he is interested in her, so to distract him Chick and Raymond instigate an argument between Trim and the restaurant owner. While they fight, Chick, Raymond and Rachel slip out and go to a shop where they arrange for Rachel's costume. By this time Raymond is starting to get interested in Rachel himself, and slips out of the shop with her while Chick is bargaining with the owner over a fake snake for Rachel's Garden of Eden dance.Raymond takes Rachel back to his hotel room, but they are interrupted before much happens by Chick at the door pretending to deliver steamship tickets. When Raymond opens the door Chick sprays him with the hotel's fire hose. At the next performance Raymond gets his revenge by roughing Chick up.When Raymond gets back to his dressing room Trim is waiting for him and makes it clear he is to leave Rachel alone as Trim wants her for himself. Raymond reluctantly agrees and Trim leaves. When Chick gets back to the room Raymond makes up with him promising he will lay off Rachel, which is not much of a sacrifice given the threat from Trim.Between performances, however, Raymond breaks his promises to both and gets Rachel back to his room. This time, however, they are interrupted by Rachel's father who has come to take her home. When Rachel refuses he tells her he will be on the 1AM train back to Pennsylvania and if she is not with him he will disown her. He then leaves. Rachel is upset at first, but then brightens telling Raymond she will have a new life with him and be happy working as a dancer at Minsky's. Raymond is taken aback knowing that the dancing is all a sham and she will be losing her family for nothing.Raymond convinces Rachel to take a nap before her performance and leaves her at his room and heads for the theater. There he instructs Spats to get Rachel onto the 1AM train. Inside the theater Billy Minsky is concerned as the theater is packed and interest in Fifi's performance is at a fever pitch. He knows that he will need more than Rachel's Bible dancing to satisfy the crowd and talks dancer Mae Harris (Gloria LeRoy) into putting on Rachel's French costume, though Mae is a bit perplexed about how she is to dance. Meanwhile Fowler and the police arrive to watch the show and see if the law is broken.In the middle of Chick and Raymond's performance Spats signals from off-stage and Raymond walks off leaving Chick to finish the act alone. Spats tell Raymond that Trim picked up Rachel and took her to his speakeasy with the idea of delivering her to the theater in time for her performance. Raymond immediately heads to the speakeasy to rescue Rachel. Chick follows and the two fight until Chick realizes that Raymond is genuinely concerned for Rachel. By this time Trim has appeared and they try to force him to let Rachel go, but even together they are no match for the brawny gangster and return to the theater bruised and without her.Trim does deliver Rachel to the theater in time and she is surprised to see Mae wearing her costume. At this point Billy Minisky confesses to her and Trim that the whole thing was a sham to embarrass Fowler. Rachel's father also arrives and when he sees her in a low-cut, sparkling evening gown Trim has given her, he calls her a whore. Something snaps in Rachel at this and when Fifi's cue is called she heads out on stage against the wishes of both Minsky and her father.Once she gets on stage she is at a loss about what to do, but tries some of the bumping and grinding moves shes seen the other girls dance. With the help of a sympathetic drummer giving her rolls and shots to her movements, she begins to improvise a routine. When she gets close to the wings, however, her father makes a grab for her and tears her dress along the leg. The crowd goes wild at this and Rachel tears the seam on the other side herself.

                    Rachel arrives in New York from her Amish community intent on becoming a dancer. Unfortunately Billy Minsky's Burlesque is hardly the place for her Dances From The Bible. But the show's comedian Raymond sees a way of wrong-footing the local do-gooders by announcing the new Paris sensation ""Mme Fifi"" and putting on Rachel's performance as the place is raided. All too complicated, the more so since her father is scouring the town for her and both Raymond and his straight-man Chick are falling for Rachel.

                    1925. Not truly comprehending what she is doing, Rachel Schpitendavel leaves her Amish Pennsylvania home to head to the National Winter Garden Theater in New York City to become a dancer. The dances she wants to perform are reenactments of Bible stories. The National Wintergarden Theater she stumbles upon in the Lower East Side is owned by Louis Minsky, and houses his son Billy Minsky's revue, Minsky's Burlesque. She meets the show's headlining act, Raymond Paine and Chick Williams, both men who fall for her. While Chick wants to protect her both by showing her what burlesque really is and by getting her away from the show, Raymond believes she is the answer to one of Billy's biggest problems, namely Vance Fowler, who feels the show is amoral and wants it shut down. Without telling Rachel what it actually means, Raymond wants to advertise Rachel as Mlle. Fifi for the midnight show, her performance advertised as the stuff that has driven all of Paris wild by its lewdness. As Raymond anticipates that Fowler will call in the police to shut the show down, Fowler will be too embarrassed to ever step foot in the theater again when Rachel, as Mlle. Fifi, instead dances her straight-laced Bible dances. Raymond doesn't care that in the process Rachel may also get hurt. As midnight approaches, whether Rachel makes it to the stage will depend on the machinations of Raymond, Chick, Billy and Louis among others, but also includes Rachel's father, Jacob Schpitendavel, who has come to New York to find his daughter and take her home before she does anything against his Amish beliefs. If she does make it to the stage, Rachel herself may have some say in what she decides to do.

    Synopsis
    Included throughout the film are various dances and routines actually used in the days of burlesque and they play as an important part in the movie as the actual plot itself.The story opens in 1925 with a young Amish girl, Rachel Schpitendavel (Britt Ekland) arriving in New York City. Rachel has dreamed of being a dancer from the time she was a little girl much to the displeasure of her strict, religious father, Jacob Schpitendavel (Harry Andrews). Rachel has run off to New York from her home in Pennsylvania to join the Minsky Burlesque show at the National Winter Garden Theater.Upon arriving at the theater she meets Professor Spats (Bert Lahr) a retired performer. He takes her into the theater to see the show. Rachel is excited about the dancing she sees, but seems clueless about most of the sexual innuendo in the performance. Spats promises her that after the show he will introduce her to the cast and Mr. Minsky.Bill Minsky (Elliott Gould), however, is having his own problems. Secretary for the Society for Decency, Vance Fowler (Denholm Elliott) is writing letters complaining about the show's skimpy costumes, suggestive dancing and bawdy humor. So far, Fowler has not convinced the police department to shutdown the show, but the letters have been disturbing to Louis Minsky (Joseph Wiseman), Bill's father. Louis owns the theater and leases it to Bill. He tells him he will not renew the lease when it expires next week. To continue the show Bill will have to buy the theater for $190,000. Bill tries to convince small time gangster and speakeasy owner Trim Houlihan (Forrest Tucker) to become partners with him and give him the money. Though Trim is a big fan of burlesque, he declines to invest.Word of the situation soon reaches the cast including the comedy team of funnyman Chick Williams (Norman Wisdom) and straight man Raymond Paine (Jason Robards). Chick is a decent, dependable, short guy who can't get a girl to take a second look at him, while Raymond is a handsome, untrustworthy womanizer that every girl adores. When Spats introduces Rachel to them, Chick is immediately taken with her while Raymond is unimpressed with her dancing specialty: interpreting stories from the Bible.After returning to his dressing room, however, Raymond gets an idea to save the show. He proposes putting Rachel into the midnight performance billed as ""Madam Fifi"" from Paris and start a rumor that she is will be doing a daring new erotic dance. This should be enough for Fowler to convince the police to raid the place. However, when the police and press appear and find only Rachel dancing her innocent Bible stories, Fowler will be discredited and cease to be a problem.Bill Minsky approves of the plan, though Chick is concerned that Rachel will be humiliated. The cast takes Rachel, their newest member, to lunch where she meets Trim Houlihan. It is clear he is interested in her, so to distract him Chick and Raymond instigate an argument between Trim and the restaurant owner. While they fight, Chick, Raymond and Rachel slip out and go to a shop where they arrange for Rachel's costume. By this time Raymond is starting to get interested in Rachel himself, and slips out of the shop with her while Chick is bargaining with the owner over a fake snake for Rachel's Garden of Eden dance.Raymond takes Rachel back to his hotel room, but they are interrupted before much happens by Chick at the door pretending to deliver steamship tickets. When Raymond opens the door Chick sprays him with the hotel's fire hose. At the next performance Raymond gets his revenge by roughing Chick up.When Raymond gets back to his dressing room Trim is waiting for him and makes it clear he is to leave Rachel alone as Trim wants her for himself. Raymond reluctantly agrees and Trim leaves. When Chick gets back to the room Raymond makes up with him promising he will lay off Rachel, which is not much of a sacrifice given the threat from Trim.Between performances, however, Raymond breaks his promises to both and gets Rachel back to his room. This time, however, they are interrupted by Rachel's father who has come to take her home. When Rachel refuses he tells her he will be on the 1AM train back to Pennsylvania and if she is not with him he will disown her. He then leaves. Rachel is upset at first, but then brightens telling Raymond she will have a new life with him and be happy working as a dancer at Minsky's. Raymond is taken aback knowing that the dancing is all a sham and she will be losing her family for nothing.Raymond convinces Rachel to take a nap before her performance and leaves her at his room and heads for the theater. There he instructs Spats to get Rachel onto the 1AM train. Inside the theater Billy Minsky is concerned as the theater is packed and interest in Fifi's performance is at a fever pitch. He knows that he will need more than Rachel's Bible dancing to satisfy the crowd and talks dancer Mae Harris (Gloria LeRoy) into putting on Rachel's French costume, though Mae is a bit perplexed about how she is to dance. Meanwhile Fowler and the police arrive to watch the show and see if the law is broken.In the middle of Chick and Raymond's performance Spats signals from off-stage and Raymond walks off leaving Chick to finish the act alone. Spats tell Raymond that Trim picked up Rachel and took her to his speakeasy with the idea of delivering her to the theater in time for her performance. Raymond immediately heads to the speakeasy to rescue Rachel. Chick follows and the two fight until Chick realizes that Raymond is genuinely concerned for Rachel. By this time Trim has appeared and they try to force him to let Rachel go, but even together they are no match for the brawny gangster and return to the theater bruised and without her.Trim does deliver Rachel to the theater in time and she is surprised to see Mae wearing her costume. At this point Billy Minisky confesses to her and Trim that the whole thing was a sham to embarrass Fowler. Rachel's father also arrives and when he sees her in a low-cut, sparkling evening gown Trim has given her, he calls her a whore. Something snaps in Rachel at this and when Fifi's cue is called she heads out on stage against the wishes of both Minsky and her father.Once she gets on stage she is at a loss about what to do, but tries some of the bumping and grinding moves shes seen the other girls dance. With the help of a sympathetic drummer giving her rolls and shots to her movements, she begins to improvise a routine. When she gets close to the wings, however, her father makes a grab for her and tears her dress along the leg. The crowd goes wild at this and Rachel tears the seam on the other side herself. With the crowd cheering her on she invents the art of striptease.Rachel unzips her dress and slides the straps off her shoulders so that it is only being held up by her hands. At this point she notices Raymond in the wings. Raymond, disgusted with himself for having turned the innocent Rachel into a stripper, has packed his suitcase and is leaving her and the show. Rachel calls his name and reaches out to him accidently letting the dress fall to the floor. She is clad only in her panties. At this Fowler signals the raid and Billy Minsky and Rachel are arrested. When Chick stands up for them, demanding to know why he hasn't been arrested, Fowler replies that Chick has not broken the law. Chick responds by squirting Fowler with seltzer and a general melee breaks out. It ends with the whole cast (with the exception of Raymond who has left) being arrested along with Rachel's father and Trim. As they emerge from the Theater to the press and the flash of cameras, we get the feeling they are considered more folk heros than criminals.Back in the theater the stage is littered with the remains of the show. Spats walks across the stage, picks up the seltzer bottle and puts it on a ladder, then leaves, turning out the lights. The credits roll.

                    Semi-fictional account of the life of British actress/singer Gertrude Lawrence. It's 1940 and approximately two decades into Gertrude's so far highly successful stage career. Gertrude is watching a just completed newsreel of her life compiled by Jerry Paul, who has asked for her critique and input, which leads to her reminiscing about her life. It tells of Gertrude's humble beginnings in Clapham, and her early career working with her vaudeville performing father. At that time, she did whatever was required to stand out from the crowd. She worked in the chorus of stage revues for impresario André Charlot, with who she had a love/hate professional relationship. An opportunity eventually led to starring roles, fame in Britain and ultimately in the United States on Broadway. But the want always to be ""on"" and to have all the world be her stage led to issues in her personal life, including some financial difficulties, and being a largely absent mother to her only offspring, daughter Pamela. She had relationships with several men over her life including stage manager Jack Roper, nobleman Sir Anthony Spencer, actor Charles Fraser, financier Ben Mitchell, and banker Richard Aldrich, only one of who probably understood and thus could handle her temperamental nature. Arguably the most important symbiotic relationship she had was with writer/actor Noël Coward, a lifelong friend and the person who would ultimately create many of her professional opportunities.

Legend has it that vampire hunters ran a sword through Catherine's heart during the reign of Louis XV, and villagers raped Nicole and blinded Sylvie with a pitchfork. But they neglected to cut off their heads, and so the sisters survived. Today, they live on a manor, surrounded by crosses and protected from the villagers. Thomas, Marc, and Brigitte don't buy the legend. They think the sisters are simply humans who have been driven mad by years of persecution and villagers who think of them as monsters. Curing them will require only dispelling the sisters' belief that they are vampires. The first step is to burn all the crosses around the house. Catherine succumbs to Thomas' promise to cure her, but Marie feels that this is a betrayal and that Catherine must die to protect the other three. Catherine and Marie stage a sword fight, but it is Marie who gets stabbed. The next morning, Catherine goes off with Thomas to see if she can get over her fear of sunlight (she can't).With the crosses removed from around the house the sisters are free to roam. This causes fear among the villagers, and they gang up to search for and kill the sisters. When Nicole goes wandering in the village, the villagers get her. They also kill Brigitte, who happened to be standing nearby. The villagers then storm the manor. Sylvie is wounded. Thomas tells Catherine that he doesn't think she is a monster and asks for 'the kiss of the vampire.' Catherine obliges. When Thomas comes to, he has been turned into a vampire. So the legend was true! To escape the angry villagers, Catherine takes Thomas through a secret passage leading to the beach.

                    This low budget first film from director Jean Rollin is in reality two very loosely-connected, surreally erotic shorts about vampirism. In the first, three Parisians including a psychoanalyst try to convince four neurotic sisters living in a decaying country chateau that their belief that they are 200 year old vampires is false. The alluring young women are influenced and controlled by a enigmatic disembodied voice which turns out to be the an aging, aristocratic lord of the manor, whose motives are unclear but clearly perverse. Local rustics unite to hunt down and kill the sanguine siblings. In the second, the Queen of the Vampires and her acolytes arrive on the scene, resurrect the dead, and promulgate the cause of the Undead while a medical researcher works to find an antidote to vampirism.

One day, after twenty years, he is called to the commander of the prison's office, and he was taken somewhere. Then, he is surprised to be in front of the premier of the USSR, Piotr Ilyich Kamenev. We come to know that Kamenev was Kiril's torturer years ago. Both recognized that they came to know each other well. Kamenev tells Lakota that he will be released, no questions answered, on condition that he will never say who freed him. Kiril wants to reject the offer, but he is told that the conditions had been accepted for him. Kamanev shows Kiril some news reports about China being about to invade Korea, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and other wheat-producing Asian nations because, in only three months, the Communist leader will not be able to feed his people and millions and millions of people will starve to death. American submarines armed with heavy and nuclear weaponry have already been deployed the area of the China Sea. David Telemond (Oskar Werner) appears and gives Kiril a Vatican passport. Kiril will be subject to diplomatic immunity until he leaves the USRR. They talk in the plane out to the Vatican, and tells him that he's written a book which the Vatican officially has considered heresy, and the next day he has to defend his last book. He also tells Kiril that he has a deadly disease, so it won't take long for him to die. George Faber (David Janssen) is the first journalist who interviews him.The present Pope (Sir John Gielgud) insists on making him a cardinal. Kiril says that he kept a steadfast faith, but that he has only worked as a priest for his fellow prisoners, so is not prepared for the position. The Pope insists so Kiril has not option but to obey.George himself has a complex personal life, with a very jealous wife, Dr Ruth Faber (Barbara Jefford), who wants him to get rid of his lover Chiara (Rosemary Dexter). A tense moment happens when the nosy Marchesa (Isa Miranda) tells Chiara to settle down and get married during a high-class party.Kiril tells David that he didn't see much conventional faith in his book. However, David insists in his views: he wants to remain a priest, and is trying to fulfill his last years alive with purpose. David answers to the court who is judging him. During the interrogatory, he stresses that the design of God includes evil acts, according to him. However, there is no verdict, as news arrives that the Pope has collapsed. George is the first who gives live the news that the Pope has died. Everybody wonders who the next Pope will be. The two most thought-of candidates, Cardinal Rinaldi (Vittorio De Sica) and Cardinal Leone (Leo McKern) do not deem themselves worthy of the position, as they are too old and a bit old-fashioned. They need new blood and new ideas for the 20th Century. After the burial of the Pope in three coffins, one inside another, all the cardinals of the church move behind locked doors until they have chosen a new pope.Kiril insists on taking David as his secretary, although it's David himself who points to the fact of the ongoing court -the decision will be taken as soon as the new Pope is elected- and he believes the verdict will be against him, but Kiril insists. They joke that the only sure thing is that the next pope would be Italian.A crowd starts gathering around Saint Peter's while all the rituals before the votation are completed: the locking of doors, the gathering of all the cardinals. Neither Leone nor Rinaldi are able to get enough votes to be elected. As the 6th vote -at two votes per day that means three days later- still shows no decisive solution, George and other people wonder how long it may take to elect someone. Even Kamenev watches George on the news. They wonder also what Cardinal will be elected, as the right person could help them to their own ends. Kamenev admits that the situation in China could blow the world out. His assistant laughs because he is asking magic to solve his problems. Kamenev says that he has run out of maths and facts.In one of the meetings between votes, Kiril says that Communism has become really conservative. Some cardinals are afraid of revolutions, and Kiril is the only one who admits violence as a means to certain ends and social justice. Questioned further, he admits that he stole bread in the Siberian camp to feed a fellow prisoner with a broken jaw, and he almost killed the guard who attacked that prisoner. When questioned how he would have felt if he had killed that guard, he says that he doesn't know, but insists that sometimes violence may be the only way out.When nighttime arrives and everybody goes to sleep, Kiril keeps on praying, tormented by his memories.The next day, after the 7th vote having been void as well, Cardinal Rinaldi (Vittorio de Sica) takes a privilege of church law to openly proclaim Kiril Lakota as his choice. Lakota, Rinaldi says, has preached and suffered imprisonment because of his faith, and he has the strength of personality to adapt the doctrine of the Catholic faith to modern times. Although Lakota is reluctant, other cardinals join in the proclamation, and Cardinals stand up and finally Lakota accepts.Gelasio (Arnodo Foà) has set out three robes, as is the custom, to accommodate the newly elected pope, whatever his size. David feels completely shocked when he, with all the rest of secretaries, sees Kiril as the new Pope. Kiril chooses his own name to carry, as it was the name of the first preacher who ""carried the Gospel"" into Ukraine.All the public falls silent when they see it's Kiril. Then, the public cheers, and Faber says that, with the world on the verge of a crisis, it's impossible to know what the possible ramifications may be in the future.INTERMISSION - ENTR'ACTEKiril wants to keep David close to him, although the rest of the cardinals disagree. Kiril thinks he's an honest man in spite of his wrong opinions. He also wants time to act and pray, changing things. Igor Bounin (Frank Finlay) comes to talk to him, with a gift from Kamenev, some sunflower seeds. Kamenev still thinks that Kiril could see the right word at the right place. Bounin, under other name, was one of the torturers of Kiril under his interrogation. Bounin, on behalf of Kamenev, says that in two months' time there will be war, and that the only solution is that Kiril speaks to China on behalf of the Western countries, and to the Western countries in behalf of China. Kiril dictates his answer: it's a risky thing to do and needs more time to think about it.Chiara meets George at the zoo. His wife has followed them there, and sees them together.Kiril wants to talk with Gelasio, who's always busy with housekeeping. Gelasio says that Rome inhabitants will make jokes about the foreign pope, but in time they will get used to it.
