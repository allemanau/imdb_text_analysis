                    The poet Dante is lost in a dark and gloomy wood. At the summit of a mountain he sees the light of salvation. He endeavors to ascend to it, but his way is barred by three wild beasts, symbolizing Avarice, Pride and Lust. Beatrice sees his predicament and descends from Paradise into Limbo, where she asks the poet Virgil to rescue and guide Dante. Virgil knows another way to go, but this leads straight through the entire Inferno, before it continues towards Paradise. Virgil leads Dante to the portals of Inferno. Charon ferries them over the river Acheron, and then they start their journey downwards through the different circles of Inferno. Dante meets all kind of sinners and sees the never-ending punishments they have to undergo. The various punishments are adjusted to the different transgressions. Among the sinners Dante recognizes many persons he has met in Florence, when they were still alive. They tell him their sad stories and why they have ended here. At last Dante and Virgil meets the arch traitor Lucifer, who holds the bodies of Brutus and Cassius in his mouth. The two poets climb down the shaggy sides of Lucifer, to reach the subterranean way which leads out of Inferno.

                    We show Lord Nelson leaving the admiralty room where he makes his famous speech and then introduce him with his captains giving the details of that wonderful plan of attack which was carried out to the letter at Trafalgar, the inspirations of the captains and their enthusiastic toast. We are then carried along to the day before the battle when the men are writing their last letters home. Here a beautiful scenic and photographic effect is introduced as the vision of the sweetheart of one of the lieutenants fades into view. This gives an opportunity to introduce that famous episode of the letter in which Lord Nelson called back the mail ship for a single message and which is endeared to the hearts of all those who sail the sea. We are then carried along to the morning of October twenty-first, Eighteen Hundred and Five, when the fleet of the enemy is sighted. The decks are cleared for action and the hoisting of the colors is portrayed with all the solemnity of the occasion before entering the battle. The correct incident of the hoisting of the famous signal ""England expects every man to do his duty"" is splendidly portrayed and carried out in every detail, and we note the pathetic touch in Nelson's life in bidding farewell to his captains having at the time a presentiment of his own death. We now get to the little human touch in his life and learn the true character of the man, for, in his last entry in his diary before the battle, he makes peace with his maker. And now we come to that wonderful spectacular picture of the real battle of Trafalgar. We see the ships in action, the firing of the guns, the ships caught on fire and then the camera switches to a close view of the deck of the Victory where human life is sacrificed by the hundreds, the fighting top of the Redoubtable, the fatal shot and Nelson's fall. We then see that wonderful character in his death, the solemnity, the beauty and the pathos of it all being carried out by the Edison players in all its grandeur; his farewell to Captain Hardy, the last kiss, the news of the victory and finally his death.

                    (Reel 1) Beamish McCoul joined the Irish insurrection and had become a leader in the movement when he was arrested and placed in Wicklow Jail. His property was confiscated by the authorities. When his followers learned of his imprisonment, they perfected a plot for his escape, which involved a rope, a fast horse and a boat to carry him from the country. Arrah Meelish, the prisoner's foster sister, volunteered to carry the idea of their plot to him. She approached the armed sentinels and begged permission to kiss her brother farewell, as the next day would bring about his execution. While kissing him a note was slipped from her mouth to his without being detected by the wardens. Later the guards were seized and Beamish made his escape from the prison, hurried to his sweetheart, Fanny Powers, bid her farewell and left for France. Four years Beamish spent in reckless exile, and, unable to endure it longer, returned to Ireland. He learned that Fanny was still true to him, having refused Colonel O'Grady, the magistrate, and her legal guardian. Beamish, on his arrival, quickly gathers together his old friends. He robs Michael Feeney, collector of the Government Clerk's Office, of his gold and banknotes and of his free pass across the mountain, because they had confiscated his property. Arrah, who has promised her hand to Shaun, a postman, secretes her foster brother in her barn and informs him of her imminent marriage. Beamish gives her as a wedding present a number of banknotes, which he robbed the collector of. Feeney, who is also a suitor for Arrah's hand, tells her that he suspects Shaun is the man who had robbed him. She is surprised and tells him she has plenty of money, at the same time showing him the banknotes which her foster brother gave her. These are recognized by the collector, who says nothing. The following day Shaun and Arrah are wed in the old barn in which Beamish is secluded. Major Coffin, an English officer, brings Colonel O'Grady information that a rebel had made a bold robbery and was at present secreted in Arrah's barn. They set out at once for her house, in company with Feeney, the informer, Fanny and soldiers. The gaiety is stopped and the searching party begins its work. Beamish makes his escape through a window, and. grasping a branch of a tree nearby, lowers himself to the ground and hurries away. Arrah is accused of harboring the rebel as Feeney had found McCoul's coat, which contains the mountain pass. Her husband takes the blame of Beamish's robbery, and says the coat is his. He is arrested and taken to prison. (Reel 2) Beamish goes to the place where he is supposed to meet his sweetheart. He is greatly distressed at not finding her there. As he sits in solitude, a messenger arrives with a letter from Fanny, saying that she had been at Arrah's cottage and knew all. He replies, stating that he has left for Dublin to visit the Secretary of State and secure, if possible, a pardon for Shaun. Fanny returns home and announces to Colonel O'Grady that she is now prepared to become his wife, but before their marriage he must obtain a pardon for the release of Shaun, who is ignorant of the whole affair. The colonel consents to do his best. Arrah is now seen at the prison, hopefully awaiting a word from her husband. Feeney enters Shaun's cell, accompanied by Fanny. Feeney starts to heap insults upon Arrah, and although Shaun's hands are tied, he pounces upon him, causing him to cry out for help. The guards order Feeney from the place. Fanny tells Shaun that she is going to denounce her affianced husband in order to save the postman from unjust punishment. Arrah, at this time, comes to the door and falls into her husband's arms and confesses that it was Beamish she had concealed in her barn. Everybody is ordered out of the room as the guards conduct Shaun into the courtroom to await trial. The verdict handed down is to the effect that Shaun must die the following day. (Reel 3) Beamish McCoul arrives at the Secretary of State in Dublin and proclaims his identity with a written confession of the affair. Colonel O'Grady arrives a few minutes later and the secretary hides McCoul behind the curtains, while O'Grady makes a plea for Shaun's release. The third person to put in an appearance is Fanny Powers, and the secretary conceals the Colonel in another place about the room. During her interview, the two men, each unconscious of the presence of the other, finding it impossible to restrain themselves longer, slip from their hiding places and confront the young woman. The old secretary reunites Beamish and his sweetheart, writes a pardon for Shaun, which he hands to the colonel, and the three depart on their missions. Meanwhile Shaun's hour approaches. Arrah climbs to the battlements of the castle in the hope of seeing her husband for the last time. Shaun discovers a loose stone in his cell, and with almost superhuman strength, breaks the barred window, thereby effecting his escape. Feeney meets Arrah upon the battlement and tries to induce her to forget Shaun and become his wife. She refuses. He is infuriated. In the meantime Shaun is stealthily climbing up the ivy on the outside of the jail, and when he reaches the top he enters into a fierce struggle with Feeney, who is finally overpowered and thrown into the waters below. At this moment the colonel, Beamish and Fanny arrive with Shaun's pardon. Beamish asks Shaun to pardon him for all the trouble he has caused him, which is joyfully granted, and the story ends showing Shaun placing his arms about his wife's neck.

                    There are two men in Pierre de Marsan, the physician who has sworn the Hippocratic Oath and the man of honor. It is the latter who reacts brutally when he discovers his wife in the arms of his friend André. But after shooting at the two-timer and injuring him seriously, the doctor in Pierre resurfaces. Realizing that if nothing is done André is doomed to die, de Marsan does his duty and rescues his rival's life. But, ultimately, it is the man of honor who regains the upper hand : de Marsan refuses to forgive his former friend. However, still in love with the one that cheated on him, he does not kick his wife out. She now has no other solution but to expiate her sins.
