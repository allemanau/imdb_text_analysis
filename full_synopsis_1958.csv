John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart), a detective, and a police officer are hot on his trail. They chase him across the top of buildings. The thief jumps between two buildings, making it across. The police officer follows, but Scottie can't get his footing. He slips. Scottie hangs on to the gutter as his fear of heights kicks in. The police officer tries to grab his hand, but he falls to his death. Scottie witnesses this and clutches the gutter.Months after the incident, Scottie reclines in the home of Marjorie ""Midge"" Wood (Barbara Bel Geddes), a painter and fashion illustrator. She is concerned about Scottie's plans now that he is back in shape. He has quit the police force due to his acrophobia, and does not want to be a desk jockey. Midge and Scottie used to be engaged back in college, but it was broken off. Scottie blithely waves their engagement off as a flight of fancy, ended by Midge, but it's clear from Midge's expression that Scottie was more likely the unwilling party and that Midge still holds a torch for him. She urges him to take a vacation. ""Don't be so motherly"", responds Scottie. They discuss an old college buddy, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), who wants to meet with Scottie. Scottie attempts to get over his fear of heights by using a step stool. He is able to handle the first two steps, but when he reaches the top, he looks out the window and panics. He collapses in Midge's arms.A familiar pedestrian crosses the street near the docks. Scottie meets Gavin, who is in the shipping business. Gavin married into the business, and he wants Scottie to tail his wife. He does not suspect infidelity, but hints that his wife has been possessed by something. She's become distant and distracted and has taken to roaming the city and surrounding area. The no-nonsense Scottie initially dismisses the supernatural undertones of Gavin's worries, but is nevertheless intrigued. Gavin tells Scottie to meet him and his wife at Ernie's Restaurant the following night.Ernie's Restaurant is a lavish, upscale eatery, plush and scarlet. Scottie first spots Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who is stunning, with platinum blonde hair and a green shawl. He is mesmerized by her.The next morning, he stalks her outside her house. She wears a simple gray suit with white gloves, as she gets into her green automobile. Scottie follows her through the streets of San Francisco, as she visits a flower shop and purchases a small bouquet. He then trails her to the Mission Dolores, where she goes through the chapel to the cemetery, finally stopping to stand at a grave. As she exits, Scottie notes the headstone, which reads ""Carlotta Valdes born: December 3 1831 died: March 5 1857."" He then tracks her to the Palace of the Legions of Honour, an art museum. Madeleine sits, staring at a portrait for hours. Scottie notices that the bouquet she purchased is just like the one in the painting. Also, her hair is done exactly like the woman in the painting. Scottie discovers from the curator that the painting is titled ""Portrait of Carlotta."" Finally, he follows her to the McKittrick Hotel, where Scottie observes Madeleine in a second story window. Scottie enters the old hotel and asks the manager (Ellen Corby), who the occupant of the room is. She hesitates to tell him, until Scottie reveals his badge. The manager reveals that the woman's name is Carlotta Valdes, but that Miss Valdes has not been in the room all day. Scottie finds this impossible, and goes up to the room, which is indeed empty. He looks down the street to discover that her car is gone.Scottie returns to Midge's home where she tells him of San Francisco historian Pop Liebel (Konstantin Shayne), who owns the Argosy Book Shop. She and Scottie pay Pop a visit and Scottie asks the man about the McKittrick hotel. Pop tells Scottie that the hotel was originally a house built by a rich man for his mistress, Carlotta Valdes, and they had a child. However, the rich man eventually discarded Carlotta, keeping their child to raise with his childless wife. Carlotta went from depressed to insane, and finally took her own life.On the drive home, Midge and Scottie talk about the portrait; he shows her the catalogue picture. The resemblance is uncanny. Another conversation with Gavin reveals that Madeleine had started to wear Carlotta's jewellery, particularly a ruby pendant shown in the painting. Madeleine's great-grandmother was Carlotta Valdes, a fact that Madeleine does not know. Gavin only knows this fact because Madeleine's mother told him.Scottie follows Madeleine the next day to the Palace of the Legions, where she gazes at the portrait. Then he follows her to Fort Point near the Golden Gate Bridge. Madeleine strolls by the shore, throwing petals into the bay, until without warning, she jumps in. Scottie dives after her. She is alive but unconscious, and he takes her back to his apartment.Madeleine wakes up at Scottie's apartment, perplexed and alarmed to find herself naked in a strange man's bed. Scottie hands her a red bathrobe and explains that he rescued her from drowning. Madeleine maintains that she must have fainted and fallen. He questions her, ""Has this ever happened to you before?"" Gavin calls, concerned about the whereabouts of his wife. Scottie reassures him that Madeleine is at his apartment. Gavin informs Scottie that Madeleine is twenty-six - the same age at which Carlotta Valdes committed suicide. Scottie hears the door close, and realises that Madeleine has left. As Madeleine drives away from Scottie's house, Midge arrives just in time to have a misunderstanding. She believes that Scottie and Madeleine are in a relationship.The next morning, Scottie trails Madeleine through the streets of San Francisco, only to find that Madeleine has been looking for Scottie's house. Scottie catches her leaving a thank you letter for saving her. She did not know the address, but followed the Coit Tower. Scottie, now smitten with Madeleine, insists that they wander together, because they are both alone.They arrive at Big Basin Redwoods State Park, where they admire the ancient redwoods. As they view a cross-section of a tree with the approximate dates of historical events, Madeleine goes into a trance, seemingly becoming Carlotta, recounting the dates of her birth and death. Madeleine wanders deeper into the woods, and Scottie follows her. He confronts her about her jump into the bay, and tries to bring Madeleine back. By the shore, Madeleine begins to reveal fragments of her vague memories: an empty grave with no name, waiting for her; an empty room in which she sits alone; and finally a tower, bell, and garden in Spain. Madeleine admits she is not crazy; she does not want to die. They kiss as the waves crash onto the rocks. Scottie promises he will never leave her.Scottie arrives at Midge's place upon having received a note from Midge inquiring as to his whereabouts. Midge mischievously reveals a new picture she's been painting-- a portrait of herself as Carlotta Valdes. Scottie is not amused by the gag. Distressed, he leaves immediately. Midge ruins the painting, upset by the depth of his feeling for Madeleine and her own misguided attempt to make light of it, which has distanced them further.Madeleine returns to Scottie's house, where she tells him of an awful dream, with a tower, a bell, and a village. As she describes the location in detail, Scottie finishes her descriptions. ""You've been there!"" he exclaims. Scottie is talking about the San Juan Bautista, a mission that has been converted into a museum. They drive to the mission.When they arrive at the mission, they enter the livery stable, where Scottie tries to dismiss the dreams logically. He points out certain objects that are real. They kiss. Madeleine explains she must do something. She asks him if he believes she loves him. He replies yes. ""And if you lose me, then you'll know I, I loved you. And I wanted to go on loving you,'' she says. She starts to go to the church, when Scottie realizes she is going to the bell tower. Scottie chases her into the chapel, and sees her run up the stairs. He follows her, but as he looks down, his vertigo sets in, paralyzing him. He cannot follow her up to the top of the bell tower. He watches, helpless, in fear and horror as Madeleine's body plunges to the tiles below. Scottie staggers out of the mission, sun blinding his eyes, dumbfounded.At the a judicial hearing concerning Madeleine's death, the judge is particularly cruel to Scottie; he insults him for letting his weakness get in the way of saving Madeleine. The court rules the incident a suicide. Gavin comforts Scottie, while telling him that, with the loss of his wife, he can no longer stay in San Francisco. Gavin sets off for Europe.Scottie has trouble sleeping. Blue and purple flashes signal his nightmare, as an animated bouquet unravels. He dreams of seeing Carlotta Valdes at the hearing, with special emphasis on the ruby necklace. Scottie walks into the cemetery where there is an open grave. Scottie falls into the grave, which has become precipitous, then his body lands next to Madeleine's on the tiles of the mission. He wakes up in a cold sweat.Midge arrives to care for Scottie in a psychiatric ward. She tries to comfort him, ""mother's here."" Scottie will not speak, he is in a daze. The doctor believes that Scottie will be incapacitated for a year due to stress and anxiety from his depression and guilt.Several months later, upon his eventual release from the hospital, Scottie remains in the grip of an obsession. He visits the old Elster home, and spots the green car. In the distance, a woman in gray suit is getting in it. Unfortunately for him, it is not Madeleine; it is an old neighbor who bought the car from Gavin. At Ernie's he spots a woman in a green evening dress, but again, it is not Madeleine. He even sees Madeleine at the Palace of the Legions, but once again, it is not her. While looking at a bouquet at a flower shop, he sees a striking brunette in a green suit. Although she doesn't resemble Madeleine in dress, style, or movement, the face is a dead ringer. He follows her to the Hotel Empire, and sees her through the fifth floor window.When Scottie knocks on the door, the woman is concerned that he is a creep. He reassures her he just wants to talk. He interrogates her rather aggressively, and she shows him proof that she is Judy Barton (Kim Novak again) from Salina, Kansas. Judy realizes that Scottie's heart is broken for his former flame, and she takes pity on him. She agrees to go for dinner with him at Ernie's.After Scottie leaves, flashbacks reveal Judy's memories. She was Madeleine, running up the steps of the bell tower. At the top, Gavin Elster was there, holding the body of the real Madeleine Elster, dressed in exactly the same outfit as Judy. It was the real Madeleine's body that was thrown off the bell tower, with Judy letting out the scream. Judy even keeps the gray suit that she wore as Madeleine Elster hidden in the back of her closet. She begins to write a letter to Scottie, explaining that she was Gavin's accomplice in the murder of his wife. She had become her doppelgänger to fool Scottie, and use him as a witness to lend credence to the idea that Madeleine was mentally unstable. Gavin had known about his vertigo, and knew that Scottie would never make it to the top of the bell tower. Judy reconsiders this letter, and tears it up.That night, Scottie suspects he sees Madeleine at Ernie's. He escorts Judy home, her apartment flooded with the green neon light of the Hotel Empire sign. He's overwhelmed by his yearning for Madeleine, a woman lost to him, although through Judy he is able to capture the ghost of Madeleine's presence. They agree to meet the next morning.They engage in a series of dates, with Scottie becoming happier with the relationship. However, little by little, he begins to make Judy over in the image of Madeleine. He searches obsessively for the gray suit and white gloves that Madeleine used to wear and even convinces Judy to bleach her hair. Although Judy begs him to love her for herself, she has fallen so in love with Scottie that she allows him to change her into the other woman.After undergoing an extensive makeover, Judy returns to an anxiously awaiting Scottie. Scottie won't brook the slightest deviation from his recreation of Madeleine, and insists that Judy pin her now platinum blonde hair up exactly the way Madeleine wore hers, which she does, completing the transformation. In a dreamlike state, with the green glow all around them, they embrace and kiss. The room turns into the livery stable from the Mission, Scottie's last kiss with Madeleine, and then back to the apartment. Scottie has finally managed to turn back time and resurrect Madeleine from the dead.A couple of nights later, the two decide to go out to Ernie's. Judy dresses up, and wears the same ruby pendant depicted in the portrait of Carlotta. Scottie realizes that something is amiss. He suddenly becomes distant. He passes Ernie's and continues driving past the redwood forest. He tells her he has one final thing to do. Judy is torn between her love for Scottie and the fear and guilt she feels over having colluded with Gavin Elster to dupe Scottie. They arrive at the mission, where Scottie forces Judy to re-enact Madeleine's last moments; their final kiss, Madeleine's parting words. He relentlessly pushes Judy up the stairs of the mission tower, discovering in the process that he's conquered his vertigo. He reveals to Judy that her necklace that belonged to Carlotte is what gave her away.As he reaches the top of the bell tower, he puts the whole puzzle together. He finally realizes that Judy was the counterfeit all along. He never knew the real Madeleine Elster. He was being set up as Gavin Elster's witness in the murder of Elster's wife. He pulls Judy to the top of the tower, where she protests. Judy pleads that she has fallen in love with Scottie. They kiss. The sudden appearance of a nun, however, startles Judy, who steps backwards and plummets to her death off the ledge. In the final shot, as the nun tolls the death bell, a devastated Scottie stands frozen in despair, having now lost the same woman twice, and this time... forever.","

The lead detective, the obese and lumbering Capt. Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles), rudely rebuffs Vargas' offer. However, Quinlan's partner, the loyal Sgt. Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia), and Adair, a district attorney (Ray Collins), apologize for Quinlan's behavior and invite Vargas to observe their investigation because of his status as a highly placed Mexican government official.In the meantime, a group of young Mexican men working for ""Uncle"" Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), a small-time crime boss with a bad toupee, bring Susan, an American, to Grandi's headquarters in a sleazy hotel. Grandi warns Susan of dire consequences if her husband continues his prosecution of Grandi's brother, an imprisoned drug dealer awaiting trial in Mexico, but Susan is unimpressed.While investigating the case on the Mexican side of the border, Quinlan visits the tawdry brothel run by Tanya, a former lover (Marlene Dietrich), and the place fills him with nostalgic yearnings. Upon learning of Susan's encounter with Grandi, Vargas decides that she will be safer stashed in a motel on the American side of the border while he continues working on the Linnekar case. However, unknown to Vargas, the motel is owned by Grandi, staffed by a very nervous night clerk (Dennis Weaver), in the middle of the desert.Quinlan soon tracks down a suspect, a Mexican shoe clerk who was having an affair with Linnekar's daughter, Marcia (Joanna Moore), and later married her in a secret ceremony. Sanchez (Victor Millan) claims he is innocent and appeals to Vargas for help. After a prolonged search, Quinlan declares that Menzies has found damning evidence of Sanchez's guilt concealed in a shoe box. Vargas, who had earlier seen that the box was empty, accuses Quinlan of planting dynamite in the box to frame Sanchez.Grandi approaches Quinlan to suggest that they work together to ruin Vargas and after Quinlan has downed several drinks at Grandi's prodding, they plot to destroy Vargas professionally and personally by framing Susan. Grandi's gang of young hoodlums, led by a sadistic woman (clad in black leather (Mercedes McCambridge), take over the motel and accost the terrified Susan, who is shot up with drugs and then transported to a room in Grandi's hotel.When Vargas meets with Police Chief Gould and District Attorney Adair to discuss his suspicions about Quinlan, the faithful Menzies doggedly tracks down his partner to inform him of the meeting. Quinlan storms in on the meeting and, furious that Gould is not defending him, makes a show of throwing down his badge. Uncomfortable with the fact that Vargas is an outsider making accusations against a star detective, Gould and Adair placate Quinlan by telling Vargas to stay out of police business. Al Schwartz, a young assistant D.A., stands by Vargas and secretly gains him access to Quinlan's case files, which strongly suggest that Quinlan, tortured by the fact that he was unable to find enough evidence to convict the suspect who strangled his wife, has been framing suspects for years. Unable to accept that his partner and best friend is crooked, Menzies attempts to defend Quinlan.Unable to reach Susan by phone, Vargas finally makes it to the motel to find the night clerk sitting in the dark and seemingly speechless with fear. To Vargas' horror, all that remains in Susan's room are the stench of marijuana smoke and the debris of a wild party.Meanwhile, Quinlan arrives at Grandi's hotel and enters the room where Susan lies unconscious, the smell of marijuana clinging to the clothing strewn about the floor. After forcing Grandi at gunpoint to telephone Menzies to report that he has found Vargas' wife surrounded by evidence of a drug party, Quinlan, who wants to ensure that he will not be a victim of blackmail, strangles Grandi with one of Susan's stockings.Soon after, Vargas, who has launched a desperate search for his wife, learns that Susan has been jailed on suspicion of drug use, prostitution and the murder of Grandi. Knowing that Quinlan is behind the frame-up and feeling helpless to stop him, Vargas explodes with rage, but Menzies takes him aside and reveals that he found Quinlan's cane at the murder scene. Although he is devastated by the fall of his idol, Menzies agrees to help Vargas amass more incontrovertible evidence of Quinlan's criminal activities and consents to being wired in the hopes that Quinlan will confess to his trusted partner.Quinlan, still on a binge, has holed up at Tanya's place where, in a drunken haze, he asks her to read his fortune. Tanya, however, sadly declares that his future is ""all used up"" and advises him to go home. As he reels out the door, Quinlan is confronted by Menzies, who begins asking questions about the Grandi murder while, nearby, Vargas records the conversation. As they walk toward a bridge spanning a murky canal, Menzies accuses Quinlan of betraying his loyalty by setting him up as the stooge who always found the planted evidence. The argument is interrupted when Quinlan hears the sound of their voices on Vargas' tape recorder and finally realizes that Menzies is wired. When Menzies tries to stop Quinlan from harming Vargas, who is clinging to the side of the bridge, Quinlan shoots him and then, in shock at what he has done, stumbles down to the canal to wash the blood from his hands.Vargas confronts Quinlan with the evidence he now has on tape, and Quinlan prepares to kill him so that he can pin the Menzies murder on him. However, Menzies, on the brink of death, manages to crawl to the edge of the bridge and shoot Quinlan. Schwartz arrives with Susan, who has been released from jail, and Vargas departs to take her home to Mexico City, knowing that he is leaving behind enough evidence to prove that Quinlan framed Susan, Sanchez and many others. Ironically, however, Sanchez has ended up confessing to the murder of Rudy Linnekar.Tanya arrives at the edge of the canal and gazing with Schwartz at Quinlan's large frame floating in the black water, she sadly remarks that Quinlan was ""some kind of a man.""","

                    Hispanic Mike Vargas and his Caucasian bride Susie Vargas, a Mexican and American citizen respectively, have just crossed the relatively open Mexico-US border into the States. Mike is relatively well known on both sides of the border, he a high ranking Mexican government official tasked largely with cleaning up the illicit drug trade. Almost immediately after they enter the States, a car which had also just entered the country and which Mike and Susie had passed many times in crossing the border, explodes, killing the driver, local American businessman Rudy Linnekar, and his unknown female passenger. Because of the cross-border implications of the case with the bomb most likely planted in Mexico, Mike decides that he should assist in the investigation, leaving Susie at an isolated motel in the meantime. Leading the investigation is the town's police captain, grizzled and gimp legged Hank Quinlan, a man known to get the criminals and known to work off his gut. Quinlan's high regard is despite being an alcoholic, his favorite watering hole which used to be a cantina brothel on the Mexican side operated by a madam named Tana who is also an amateur fortune teller. His drinking is apparently under control. In this case, Quinlan's gut tells him that the person who killed Linnekar is a Mexican national named Manelo Sanchez, who is secretly associated with Linnekar's daughter, Marcia Linnekar. The American officials and Mike take the opportunity of the relatively open border to conduct their investigation on both sides. Quinlan discovers hard evidence that Sanchez is indeed the murderer. However, Mike questions Quinlan's findings, in the process questioning what has been his highly respected and successful career in law enforcement. Quinlan will seemingly go to any length to protect his good name and integrity. Thrown into the mix is a local resident named Joe Grandi, who is out for Mike because one of the people Mike is investigating is Grandi's brother. In these many battles, Susie may be more than acceptable collateral damage for Quinlan and Grandi, with the Linnekar case lost in the shuffle.

Mike Vargas, a high ranking Mexican narcotics official on honeymoon with his bride, Susie, is drawn into the investigation because a Mexican national has been accused of the crime. The figurative and physical presence of Hank Quinlan as the 330 pound sheriff looms all over. Quinlan is a fanatic where ""justice"" is concerned, even if obtaining it involves planting evidence. Quinlan's reputation for law and order enables him to bend the law without question until Vargas confronts him. From that point on, it's a battle of wits between the two that, with an accelerating pace, rushes to a climax.

    Synopsis
    While passing through the seedy border town of Los Robles, newlyweds Mike and Susan Vargas (Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh) witness a car bomb explosion in which Rudy Linnekar, a local construction magnate, and his female companion are killed.Suspecting that the bomb was planted on the Mexican side of the border and may be the work of the Grandi narcotics ring, Vargas, the Mexican head of the Pan-American Narcotics Commission, offers his assistance to the Los Robles officials investigating the case. The lead detective, the obese and lumbering Capt. Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles), rudely rebuffs Vargas' offer. However, Quinlan's partner, the loyal Sgt. Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia), and Adair, a district attorney (Ray Collins), apologize for Quinlan's behavior and invite Vargas to observe their investigation because of his status as a highly placed Mexican government official.In the meantime, a group of young Mexican men working for ""Uncle"" Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), a small-time crime boss with a bad toupee, bring Susan, an American, to Grandi's headquarters in a sleazy hotel. Grandi warns Susan of dire consequences if her husband continues his prosecution of Grandi's brother, an imprisoned drug dealer awaiting trial in Mexico, but Susan is unimpressed.While investigating the case on the Mexican side of the border, Quinlan visits the tawdry brothel run by Tanya, a former lover (Marlene Dietrich), and the place fills him with nostalgic yearnings. Upon learning of Susan's encounter with Grandi, Vargas decides that she will be safer stashed in a motel on the American side of the border while he continues working on the Linnekar case. However, unknown to Vargas, the motel is owned by Grandi, staffed by a very nervous night clerk (Dennis Weaver), in the middle of the desert.Quinlan soon tracks down a suspect, a Mexican shoe clerk who was having an affair with Linnekar's daughter, Marcia (Joanna Moore), and later married her in a secret ceremony. Sanchez (Victor Millan) claims he is innocent and appeals to Vargas for help. After a prolonged search, Quinlan declares that Menzies has found damning evidence of Sanchez's guilt concealed in a shoe box. Vargas, who had earlier seen that the box was empty, accuses Quinlan of planting dynamite in the box to frame Sanchez.Grandi approaches Quinlan to suggest that they work together to ruin Vargas and after Quinlan has downed several drinks at Grandi's prodding, they plot to destroy Vargas professionally and personally by framing Susan. Grandi's gang of young hoodlums, led by a sadistic woman (clad in black leather (Mercedes McCambridge), take over the motel and accost the terrified Susan, who is shot up with drugs and then transported to a room in Grandi's hotel.When Vargas meets with Police Chief Gould and District Attorney Adair to discuss his suspicions about Quinlan, the faithful Menzies doggedly tracks down his partner to inform him of the meeting. Quinlan storms in on the meeting and, furious that Gould is not defending him, makes a show of throwing down his badge. Uncomfortable with the fact that Vargas is an outsider making accusations against a star detective, Gould and Adair placate Quinlan by telling Vargas to stay out of police business. Al Schwartz, a young assistant D.A., stands by Vargas and secretly gains him access to Quinlan's case files, which strongly suggest that Quinlan, tortured by the fact that he was unable to find enough evidence to convict the suspect who strangled his wife, has been framing suspects for years. Unable to accept that his partner and best friend is crooked, Menzies attempts to defend Quinlan.Unable to reach Susan by phone, Vargas finally makes it to the motel to find the night clerk sitting in the dark and seemingly speechless with fear. To Vargas' horror, all that remains in Susan's room are the stench of marijuana smoke and the debris of a wild party.Meanwhile, Quinlan arrives at Grandi's hotel and enters the room where Susan lies unconscious, the smell of marijuana clinging to the clothing strewn about the floor. After forcing Grandi at gunpoint to telephone Menzies to report that he has found Vargas' wife surrounded by evidence of a drug party, Quinlan, who wants to ensure that he will not be a victim of blackmail, strangles Grandi with one of Susan's stockings.Soon after, Vargas, who has launched a desperate search for his wife, learns that Susan has been jailed on suspicion of drug use, prostitution and the murder of Grandi. Knowing that Quinlan is behind the frame-up and feeling helpless to stop him, Vargas explodes with rage, but Menzies takes him aside and reveals that he found Quinlan's cane at the murder scene. Although he is devastated by the fall of his idol, Menzies agrees to help Vargas amass more incontrovertible evidence of Quinlan's criminal activities and consents to being wired in the hopes that Quinlan will confess to his trusted partner.Quinlan, still on a binge, has holed up at Tanya's place where, in a drunken haze, he asks her to read his fortune. Tanya, however, sadly declares that his future is ""all used up"" and advises him to go home. As he reels out the door, Quinlan is confronted by Menzies, who begins asking questions about the Grandi murder while, nearby, Vargas records the conversation. As they walk toward a bridge spanning a murky canal, Menzies accuses Quinlan of betraying his loyalty by setting him up as the stooge who always found the planted evidence. The argument is interrupted when Quinlan hears the sound of their voices on Vargas' tape recorder and finally realizes that Menzies is wired. When Menzies tries to stop Quinlan from harming Vargas, who is clinging to the side of the bridge, Quinlan shoots him and then, in shock at what he has done, stumbles down to the canal to wash the blood from his hands.Vargas confronts Quinlan with the evidence he now has on tape, and Quinlan prepares to kill him so that he can pin the Menzies murder on him. However, Menzies, on the brink of death, manages to crawl to the edge of the bridge and shoot Quinlan. Schwartz arrives with Susan, who has been released from jail, and Vargas departs to take her home to Mexico City, knowing that he is leaving behind enough evidence to prove that Quinlan framed Susan, Sanchez and many others. Ironically, however, Sanchez has ended up confessing to the murder of Rudy Linnekar.Tanya arrives at the edge of the canal and gazing with Schwartz at Quinlan's large frame floating in the black water, she sadly remarks that Quinlan was ""some kind of a man.""

We zoom in progressively until the hole fills the screen and a fly crawls into frame.The opening scene is at night, outside the factory of Delambre Freres Electronics in Montreal. A cat, Satan, is picked up by the night watchman, Gaston (an uncredited Torben Meyer). He starts his rounds. He hears the sound of a hydraulic press starting. Gaston sees a smartly dressed woman, who he later recognizes as Helene Delambre (Patricia Owens), stare at him in surprise. She runs away. He approaches the press and notices, in horror, that it is covered in blood. A body lays crumpled on the floor next to the press. He recoils in horror and screams. A phone rings in the home office of Francois Delambre (Vincent Price). His sister-in-law, Helene, is calling. She calmly tells him, ""Francois, I've killed Andre. I need your help."" Francois thinks it is a cruel joke but changes his mind when Helene breaks down sobbing and implores him to, ""Call the police and come quickly."" Before he can leave his office, there is another call, this time from Gaston at the factory. Gaston reports a murder. Francois calls an acquaintance at the Anthenium Club, a fellow member, Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall). He reports the crime, then waits for Charas to collect him at his home. As Charas and the police examine the crime scene, an ambulance team collects Andre's body. Francois raises the press so what is left of the body can be removed. It is noted that the press was set to zero and single strokes. Francois positively identifies his brother based on a scar on his left leg--war wound. Francois is baffled by the crime.Francois and Charas go to see Helene at home. Emma (Kathleen Freeman), the housekeeper, meets them at the door. Dr. Ejoute (an uncredited Eugene Borden), the family doctor, reports that she is calm and admitted to the crime. They enter the living room to confront Helene Delambre. She is very calm and volunteers, ""I killed my husband, Andre Delambre, about half an hour ago in the hydraulic press shed."" She admits to killing him, but when asked why she is adamant, ""I cannot answer that question."" She provides specific details of the crime, then offers Charas coffee. She is polite and answers all questions except one--WHY. She hears the buzz of a fly in the room. She gets up and searches for it. She registers relief when she finds it on a lampshade and it is only an ordinary fly. She returns to the couch and more questions from Charas. Charas makes arrangements with the doctor to provide a police nurse to attend to Helene. Before he leaves, Charas asks Francois to show him the lab. Francois discovers the lab a shambles. Charas tells Francois that he is baffled and, ""There appears to be no motive, no reason except insanity."" Charas suggests Francois take charge of his nephew for the time being.The police nurse, Andersone (Betty Lou Gerson) brings Helene her lunch, then takes her pulse. She sits and occupies her time with her reports and needlepoint. Helene makes a point to mention her son, but pretends she does not know him. The nurse registers mild surprise, then makes a note on the chart. Helen starts eating, then stops when she hears a fly buzzing in the room. The nurse bats at it, much to Helene's shock and concern. The nurse rolls up a newspaper and chases it around the room. She becomes hysterical when the nurse swats it by the window. Helene collapses and is helped back to bed sobbing. The nurse collects the dead insect and gives it to Charas. Charas asks Francois, ""Mr. Delambre, do you think shes mad?"" ""It's obvious, isn't it?"" is the reply, but Charas surprises Francois with his conclusion. ""In spite of what the doctors think. I believe Mrs. Delambre's mind is quite clear. Even when catching flies."" Charas intends to charge Helene with murder, the warrant will be issued the next day.Francois is having dinner with his nephew, Philippe (Charles Herbert). When asked about the life expectancy of flies, Francois responds that he doesn't know. Philippe volunteers that he found the special fly his mother was looking for--one with a white head and leg. The discussion intrigues Francois, especially the mention of it being in his study. He calls Charas, but decides not to talk to him. He goes to his brother's house, and lies to the nurse to secure a visit with Helene. He convinces Helene he has the special fly and wants the whole story. He finally convinces her to come clean, but before she recounts the tale she insists Charas be present. She demands Francois promise to kill the fly he claims he has. Charas arrives and she tells her story.It started a few months earlier. She and her son are playing in the living room when her husband, Andre (David Hedison as Al Hedison) appears. While Philippe plays with the family cat, Dandelo, Andre and Helene go to the basement lab. Andre proudly shows her all the new equipment. He demands secrecy, then shows her his new line of research. He places an ugly green plate, a wedding present, in a glass and metal container. He fires up the machine. The room goes dark, and the container glows a bright blue, then a flash of light and the equipment powers down. Helene is surprised by an empty container. They walk to another room and the plate is now in an identical container. Andre explains the concept to his disbelieving wife. She chuckles, noticing that the matter transference device has one little flaw. Helene points out the ""Made in Japan"" stamp on the bottom of the plate is mirror-imaged. Andre returns to his desk and begins a review of his work. He recalculates, rechecks and retests. This time with a newspaper, the transfer is successful. Andre decides to run a test with the family cat, Dandelo. The saucer of milk transfers fine, but to his horror the cat fails to appear. He hears only the plaintive echo of the cat's cries in the room.Helene is preparing to go out for the evening. Andre appears. He has been busy in the lab for weeks and insists they go out to celebrate. They return to the lab very late and Andre shows his wife the improvements he has made to the equipment by transferring a bottle of champagne. The label is perfect and the wine is still cold. He then transfers a guinea pig, against his wife's objections. The animal appears fine after re-integration. Andre confesses that his first live animal experiment, Dandelo, was not successful. Helene expresses her concern about the technology, ""It's frightening. It's like playing God.""It has been a month and the guinea pig is fine. Andre is relaxing out in the garden. Helene joins him. She tells Andre that Francois is coming to lunch. Andre is excited and tells his wife, ""Bring him down to the lab. We'll show him now."" Francois and Helene go down stairs to the lab, but encounter a note on the locked door instead of a welcome inside. It says, ""I am working. Do not Disturb."" Francois comments about the bad penmanship. Philippe enters the house. He excitedly tells his mom, ""I caught such a funny-looking fly. You want to see it? It has a funny white head and sort of white leg."" His mother tells him to let it go at once.A report from Emma about Andre not touching his dinner does not alarm Helene. She walks down to the lab to check on her husband. She picks up a note that was slowly pushed under the locked door. She reads it aloud, ""Helene, I've had some trouble. I've had a serious accident. But I'm not in danger at the moment, although it's a matter of life or death. It's no good calling to me or saying anything. I can't answer. I can't speak."" He asks for a bowl of milk laced with rum. She prepares the concoction and returns to the lab, knocking three times to gain entry. Andre lets her in. A note explains that he needs her to find a fly with a white head. She remembers Philippe's find from earlier that day. Andre has a black cloth covering his head and keeps his left arm hidden in his lab coat pocket. He slurps up his milk while Helene searches for a fly she knows is not there. She recounts the story her son told her. Andre gets up and his fly arm is revealed. Helene screams. Andre motions her out of the lab, then locks her out. He types the next set of instructions for his wife.The next morning Helene wakes. She thinks the whole episode was just a nightmare, but her morning meeting and typed note confirms the nightmare is real. Andre explains that his experiment by transmitting himself the first time was successful. A second try was not so. The note explains, ""But in the second experiment, a fly which I did not notice was in the disintegrator with me. When we integrated again, our atoms were mixed. Now my only hope is to find the fly. I've got to go through the machine once more and pray our atoms untangle. If you can't find it, I'll have to destroy myself."" Helene asks to see her husband's face, but he refuses. Helene tells Emma that they must find a fly. She presses her son into service to find the special fly. Helene screeches at Emma, who misunderstood the request and killed a fly with a swatter, ""I said catch them! Dont kill them!"" After Philippe returns with no luck, he and his mother spot the fly on a lamp shade. The head and one leg are indeed white. They carefully approach it, but it flies over to the window. Helene puts out some sugar to attract their prey. Philippe catches it, but it escapes the net. It escapes outside through a broken section of the glass. It is now outside and Helene and Philippe search for it. Helene is exhausted and exasperated. She returns to the lab and tells her husband of their bad luck. While he attempts to eat, she reads his next note, ""If you had caught the fly, you would not be reading this. I know you will never catch it now. It's hopeless. There are things man should never experiment with. Now I must destroy everything, all evidence, even myself. No one must ever know what I discovered. It's too dangerous. I've thought of a way. It's not easy, but I need your help."" She pleads with her husband not to destroy himself. She convinces him to transmit himself one more time, even without the fly. Transmission is successful, but without the fly, he is the same. She pulls the black cloth away, then shrieks with horror at the visage. Andre has the head of a fly. We see Helene as Andre now sees her through compound eyes. She backs away from Andre and faints. He picks her up and places her on the couch in the lab. He comforts her with his good arm and hand, but can't control his fly arm that means to harm his wife. He goes on a rampage and destroys the delicate electronic equipment. He burns all his notes. Helene wakes and approaches her husband. She recoils from Andre as he approaches her. He retrieves the black cloth and puts it back over his head. He erases the blackboard, then scribbles another note to Helene, ""No use now--help me--but don't come near me. Kill fly, please. Love you."" She follows him to the factory next door. He starts the press and points to the red button. He places his head and arm under the press then motions for her to start the press. The press crushes Andres fly head, but his arm is still untouched. She resets the press, places his fly arm on the bed, then directs the press down a second time. The story is finished, and we are back in the present.Charas is told Andre destroyed his notes, but she erased his note on the blackboard. Charas thanks her for telling the story. Francois and Charas prepare to leave the house. Charas promises, ""I'll be back at 10:00 with a warrant for her arrest on the charge of murder. Nurse Andersone is under strict instructions not to leave her for any reason. I'm satisfied now. She's quite insane. She won't hang."" Charas provides a glimmer of hope to Francois, ""Show me the fly.""The next day Francois returns to the house and asks Emma about the fly. She tells Francois it was just a fly. Francois sits on a bench in the garden, oblivious to the fly caught in a spider's web. It cries out for help, but Francois cannot hear it. It is now 10:00 a.m. and Charas has returned, as promised, with his warrant and an ambulance to transport Helene. When told of her arrest, Helene reacts by asking Francois to show the inspector the fly. Francois admits he never had the fly. Francois takes Philippe outside so he can't witness his mother's arrest. He mentions he saw the fly again, ""It's in a web. A spiders going to get it. By the bench in the garden."" Francois retrieves Charas. They walk out into the garden. Charas and Francois see the tiny arm and head on a fly's body and the spider ready to pounce. The tiny thing screams, ""Help Me!"" As the spider covers its tiny victim, Charas picks up a rock and crushes both. Francois accuses Charas that if Helene killed a man with a fly's head, then he is as guilty for killing a fly with a man's head. They collectively concoct and agree to a scenario for suicide.Sometime later, Philippe and Helene are playing croquet in the yard. Francois arrives to take his nephew to the zoo. In reply to his nephew's query about his father's death, Francois tells Philippe, ""He was searching for the truth. But for one instant, he was careless. The search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world and the most dangerous."" We close with Helene escorting her son and Francois out of the yard.","
    
                    After her husband Andre Delambre is crushed to death in a mechanical press, his wife recounts to his brother Francois Delambre and police Inspector Charas the events of the previous few months. They were very much in love and with their little boy, a very happy family. Andre was experimenting with teleportation - transporting objects from one point to another by breaking the object down to the atomic level and then reassembling it in a receiver a distance away. The system had some glitches - it seemed to work with inanimate object but his cat disappeared when he tried teleporting it. He thinks he's solved all of the problems with his invention and decides to try and teleport himself. When a fly enters the teleportation device with him, disaster strikes.

She recounts the story her son told her. Andre gets up and his fly arm is revealed. Helene screams. Andre motions her out of the lab, then locks her out. He types the next set of instructions for his wife.The next morning Helene wakes. She thinks the whole episode was just a nightmare, but her morning meeting and typed note confirms the nightmare is real. Andre explains that his experiment by transmitting himself the first time was successful. A second try was not so. The note explains, ""But in the second experiment, a fly which I did not notice was in the disintegrator with me. When we integrated again, our atoms were mixed. Now my only hope is to find the fly. I've got to go through the machine once more and pray our atoms untangle. If you can't find it, I'll have to destroy myself."" Helene asks to see her husband's face, but he refuses. Helene tells Emma that they must find a fly. She presses her son into service to find the special fly. Helene screeches at Emma, who misunderstood the request and killed a fly with a swatter, ""I said catch them! Dont kill them!"" After Philippe returns with no luck, he and his mother spot the fly on a lamp shade. The head and one leg are indeed white. They carefully approach it, but it flies over to the window. Helene puts out some sugar to attract their prey. Philippe catches it, but it escapes the net. It escapes outside through a broken section of the glass. It is now outside and Helene and Philippe search for it. Helene is exhausted and exasperated. She returns to the lab and tells her husband of their bad luck. While he attempts to eat, she reads his next note, ""If you had caught the fly, you would not be reading this. I know you will never catch it now. It's hopeless. There are things man should never experiment with. Now I must destroy everything, all evidence, even myself. No one must ever know what I discovered. It's too dangerous. I've thought of a way. It's not easy, but I need your help."" She pleads with her husband not to destroy himself. She convinces him to transmit himself one more time, even without the fly. Transmission is successful, but without the fly, he is the same. She pulls the black cloth away, then shrieks with horror at the visage. Andre has the head of a fly. We see Helene as Andre now sees her through compound eyes. She backs away from Andre and faints. He picks her up and places her on the couch in the lab. He comforts her with his good arm and hand, but can't control his fly arm that means to harm his wife. He goes on a rampage and destroys the delicate electronic equipment. He burns all his notes. Helene wakes and approaches her husband. She recoils from Andre as he approaches her. He retrieves the black cloth and puts it back over his head. He erases the blackboard, then scribbles another note to Helene, ""No use now--help me--but don't come near me. Kill fly, please. Love you."" She follows him to the factory next door. He starts the press and points to the red button. He places his head and arm under the press then motions for her to start the press. The press crushes Andres fly head, but his arm is still untouched. She resets the press, places his fly arm on the bed, then directs the press down a second time. The story is finished, and we are back in the present.Charas is told Andre destroyed his notes, but she erased his note on the blackboard. Charas thanks her for telling the story. Francois and Charas prepare to leave the house. Charas promises, ""I'll be back at 10:00 with a warrant for her arrest on the charge of murder. Nurse Andersone is under strict instructions not to leave her for any reason. I'm satisfied now. She's quite insane. She won't hang."" Charas provides a glimmer of hope to Francois, ""Show me the fly.""The next day Francois returns to the house and asks Emma about the fly. She tells Francois it was just a fly. Francois sits on a bench in the garden, oblivious to the fly caught in a spider's web. It cries out for help, but Francois cannot hear it. It is now 10:00 a.m. and Charas has returned, as promised, with his warrant and an ambulance to transport Helene. When told of her arrest, Helene reacts by asking Francois to show the inspector the fly. Francois admits he never had the fly. Francois takes Philippe outside so he can't witness his mother's arrest. He mentions he saw the fly again, ""It's in a web. A spiders going to get it. By the bench in the garden."" Francois retrieves Charas. They walk out into the garden. Charas and Francois see the tiny arm and head on a fly's body and the spider ready to pounce. The tiny thing screams, ""Help Me!"" As the spider covers its tiny victim, Charas picks up a rock and crushes both. Francois accuses Charas that if Helene killed a man with a fly's head, then he is as guilty for killing a fly with a man's head. They collectively concoct and agree to a scenario for suicide.Sometime later, Philippe and Helene are playing croquet in the yard. Francois arrives to take his nephew to the zoo. In reply to his nephew's query about his father's death, Francois tells Philippe, ""He was searching for the truth. But for one instant, he was careless. The search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world and the most dangerous."" We close with Helene escorting her son and Francois out of the yard.

He falls and injures his right leg.Some days later, Brick and his older brother, Gooper (Jack Carson), visit the family cotton plantation in eastern Mississippi to celebrate their father's 65th birthday on a hot and humid August day. The family rumor is that the wealthy patriarch ""Big Daddy"" Pollitt (Burl Ives) may have developed colon cancer and would be forced to quickly settle his will, leaving his money and land to one of his two sons before he dies.Gooper and his shrew wife Mae (Madeleine Sherwood) have gone to great lengths to stay in Big Daddy's good favor. Gooper has lived his entire life in accordance with his father's casual instructions, and he and Mae have a ""dynasty"" of children to carry on the Pollitt name. Brick's wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) is clever and outspoken, and holds no small amount of contempt for Gooper and Mae's entitled attitudes and five spoiled and obnoxious offspring who run around the house unsupervised. Brick, recovering from his leg injury on crutches, spends all his time in his bedroom, drinking heavily and argues with Maggie about the dismal state of their marriage. Maggie still adores Brick, though she is troubled by his self-destructive behavior, and Brick is angry and sullen towards Maggie because of a yet unspecified incident involving his recently-deceased friend Skipper. Adding to the pressure is Gooper's and Mae's constant criticism of Brick and Maggie due to Brick's alcoholism and the fact that they are childless.Big Daddy and his wife Ida (Judith Anderson) arrive home on their private airplane from the Mayo Clinic where Big Daddy received the news that he is not dying of cancer after all. They are greeted at the airport by Gooper, Mae, and their brood of kids, but Big Daddy ignores them and is driven home by Maggie. Big Daddy is openly dismissive of Gooper's and Mae's sycophantic attitudes, knowing that they fawn over him in an attempt to secure his money and plantation for themselves. Upon arrival back at the Pollitt plantation, Brick refuses to greet his father or come down for the party, and remains in his room, drinking.While the birthday celebration begins, Maggie runs upstairs to tell Brick of Big Daddy's positive test results and entreats him to make an appearance at the party. Brick refuses and continues drinking. Disappointed, Maggie declares that she cannot live without Brick, but when she embraces him, he flees, locking himself in the bathroom. Moments later, Ida bursts in to the bedroom looking for Brick and demands to know if he is still drinking. She then remarks that Maggie's continued childlessness and Brick's alcoholism are indicative of a failed marriage. Dr. Baugh (Larry Gates) then intervenes, asking to examine Brick's ankle. Once alone with Brick, Dr. Baugh confides that he has lied about Big Daddy's condition, which is fatal. The doctor admits he told Gooper the truth, but decided to spare Big Daddy and Ida to let them enjoy the party. In reality, Big Daddy really has terminal colon cancer and will be dead within a few months. The brothers initially keep the information to themselves, but Brick soon tells Maggie, who is deeply saddened.As the evening wears on, the party wines down as it begins to rain, forcing the few guests and family inside. As the last of the guests depart, Big Daddy soon grows annoyed with the party and his fickle family and ventures upstairs to speak with Brick, his favorite son. He chastises him for his excessive drinking, and for his cold treatment of Maggie. Brick grows defensive and even violent when Big Daddy brings up the subject of Skipper, Brick's old football buddy who had jumped from a fifth-floor hotel window to his death a few years before. Realizing that there is more to the story, Big Daddy brings Maggie into the conversation. She explains that she hated Brick's pro-football career because he always put it before her, and that she hated Skipper for distracting Brick from his marriage. (Note: there is subtle suggestion here that Brick and Skipper had been romantically involved.) Maggie describes a drunken episode between herself and Skipper in which she considered seducing him simply to spite her husband, but reconsidered at the last minute. Brick then explains that Skipper had telephoned him, seeming to think that he and Maggie had actually made love (though he had been too drunk to remember clearly). Skipper tearfully tried to apologize to his best friend, but Brick angrily hung up on him. Skipper killed himself soon after, and Brick blamed Maggie for the tragedy. Brick angrily leaves the house as the thunderstorm rages. Big Daddy follows him out into the rain and tries to prevent his drunken son from getting into the car and driving home, but Brick angrily reveals to his father that the doctor had lied... that his illness is terminal. A shocked Big Daddy goes inside the house and down to the basement to be alone, while Brick, emotionally exhausted, is escorted back inside by Maggie.During this time, as nearly all of the other guests have left the party, Gooper and Mae had been trying to convince Ida to settle Big Daddy's will to give them the entire estate. Ida is still unaware of her husband's condition. As Ida begins to feel stress from all the hub-bub, Mae lets it slip that Big Daddy's cancer test was positive as Gooper told her minutes ago. The doctor has no choice but to admit the truth. Ida is at first overcome, but then firmly states that her husband will not be dying anytime soon, desperately trying to hold together the last traces of family unity. Maggie joins the conversation and speaks calmly to Ida to soothe her, whereas Gooper and Mae continue to hound Ida with demands. At this point, the personal rivalry between the two sisters-in-law, Mae and Maggie, becomes clear as they begin arguing with each other. Maggie reveals that she sees Mae as a dishonest, greedy, selfish, trailer-trash interloper who married Gooper solely for his parents wealth; Mae, who is pregnant with her sixth child, verbally counter-attacks with her belief that Maggie does not deserve any inheritance because she is childless and her husband drinks.Meanwhile, Brick has put on clean dry clothes and followed his father to the cellar. Big Daddy sits in silence in his bathrobe as the apologetic doctor explains that there is no use in hiding the truth. He gives Big Daddy morphine and a syringe for the pain, and returns upstairs. Brick and Big Daddy slowly begin to rehash the past, with Brick angrily pointing out that Big Daddy's version of ""family love"" consists of showering his wife and sons with money and material possessions. Big Daddy admits that he indeed does not care for many of his family members, including his wife, and that he built his business to demonstrate the great things he was capable of.After further prodding, Big Daddy recollects his own father: a boxcar tramp with no real job and no authority. Though he first speaks of his father with hostility, Big Daddy begins to smile as he remembers the fun he had as a child. He admits that he had loved his father more than anything, though he had been poor and overlooked by society. Brick becomes overwrought with emotion and trashes the basement, breaking the expensive items that his father had bought over the years to demonstrate his wealth. Once he calms down, he finally sees eye to eye with his father and the two weakened men help each other up the stairs.Maggie, Gooper, Mae, and Ida are still in a heated conversation in the living room over Big Daddy's will, with Gooper and Mae demanding the majority of his estate when he passes on.

Big Daddy speaks to his wife with newfound respect and affection, and has adopted a positive outlook despite his condition. To halt the argument about the inheritance, Maggie tells the family that she is finally pregnant. Mae is outraged and calls her a liar, but Big Daddy and Ida are happy at the news.

                    The family of ""Big Daddy"" Pollitt convenes at his and Big Momma's vast 28,000 acre East Mississippi plantation for his sixty-fifth birthday, although it may as well be for his funeral on the belief that he is dying. Despite his latest medical report being clean, in reality he truly does have terminal colon cancer, something the doctor only tells Big Daddy's two sons, Gooper Pollitt, a lawyer, and Brick Pollitt, who recently left his job as a sportscaster. Brooding Brick and his wife Maggie Pollitt, who have driven up from New Orleans for the occasion, are going through a long rough patch in their marriage. Brick wanted to split, but Maggie convinced him to stay married on the condition that she not pressure him for sex. In their troubles, Brick has turned to the bottle, leading to a drunken incident which has left Brick currently on crutches. Maggie believes Gooper and his wife Mae Pollitt are trying to orchestrate Brick out of Big Daddy's will. Brick and Maggie's saving grace is Big Daddy has greater affinity for them than Gooper and Mae. Maggie is beautiful and Brick was a star athlete, specifically in football and track. As Gooper and Mae have a sixth child on the way, Maggie also believes they could combat anything Gooper and Mae could do by having a child of their own. In his current state, Brick has contempt for everyone and everything around him, which includes Big Daddy's money. All Brick and Maggie's problems seem to center on their respective relationships with Brick's high school friend and football partner, Skipper, and events in their lives just prior to Skipper's death. What happens not only with Brick and Maggie but the entire Pollitt family may depend on if Brick can reconcile himself with his life, much of which is currently in Big Daddy's house, including Maggie.

                    Weary of the conventions of Parisian society, a rich playboy and a youthful courtesan-in-training enjoy a platonic friendship, but it may not stay platonic for long. Gaston, the scion of a wealthy Parisian family finds emotional refuge from the superficial lifestyle of upper class Parisian 1900s society with the former mistress of his uncle and her outgoing, tomboy granddaughter, Gigi. When Gaston becomes aware that Gigi has matured into a woman, her grandmother and aunt, who have educated Gigi to be a wealthy man's mistress, urge the pair to act out their roles but love adds a surprise twist to this delightful turn-of-the 20th century Cinderella story.

                    Gigi, living in the Belle Époque era of Paris, is training to be a courtesan- a highly educated and cultured woman who will become a society darling and mistress to wealthy men. She is mentored by her kind but firm Grandmother who has raised her and her glamorous, flamboyant Aunt Alicia. Both try to teach her the ways of good manners, first class diamonds and rolling cigars however the vivacious and idealistic tomboy is resistant. Her respite from her lessons comes in the form of her good friend Gaston - a wealthy aristocrat and playboy who is bored by the decadent but superficial world he inhabits. The two have a dear playful friendship. However with Gigi growing up and Gaston's current mistress being caught up in scandal can these two escape the inevitable roles their two worlds seemed determine to place on them and perhaps explore the true feelings that lie beneath their friendship? All this takes place under the eye of Honore Lachaille (played by the legendary Maurice Chevalier) Gaston's charming, cheery and youthful Uncle who doubles as the movie's narrator and Gaston's mentor in the story. Comedy, romance and many a delightful song ensue.

                    Gaston is a restless Parisian playboy who moves from one mistress to another, while also spending time with Gigi, a precocious younger friend learning the ways of high society. The platonic relationship between Gaston and Gigi changes, however, when she matures, but the possibility of something lasting seems unlikely since he won't commit to one woman. Gigi refuses to be anyone's mistress, however, and Gaston must choose between her and his carefree lifestyle.

                    A successful attempt at an even-handed portrayal of the White Star Line's (later part of Cunard) luxury liner R.M.S. Titanic's sinking from the standpoint of 2nd Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller, himself the most senior of the ill-fated ship's Deck Officers to survive the disaster. (Lightoller later went on to distinguish himself as a line British Naval Officer during the First World War and served as a Senior Naval Staff Officer (convoys) during WWII. Between wars he owned and operated a successful family business producing pleasure craft.) His own survival of the sinking, along with several others, is shown atop one of the liner's two ""collapsible"" lifeboats which was capsized in floating off the liner as it sank. The picture depicts then known facts (c1958) as reported after the sinking; such as the woeful lack of adequate lifeboats, the ship's band playing true to the very end, White Star's co-owner Bruce Ismay's somewhat less than chivalrous departure from the sinking vessel -and- the Titanic's designer (Andrews, on-board) revelation that due to the severity of below-the-water-line damage and that the vaunted watertight compartments were not designed to nor sealed up to the weather deck, would only delay the inevitable as sea water spilled over the top of one to the next from the bows to the stern. It also addresses the mysterious ship seen from the Titanic's bridge stopped some 12-19 miles off and depicts it as being the S.S. Californian, whom - if that steamship had responded, the loss of life could have been far, far less. The Californian is seen stopped due to the ice warnings, the same alerts whose import were undervalued by the Titanic's Captain Smith. She herself had shut-down wireless operations, nominally at 11:00pm as her sole operator retired for the evening, this before the iceberg was struck and the 1st distress calls were made by Titanic. It also addresses somewhat the coal fire in one of Titanic's bunkers - apparently not uncommon back in those days, before her departure into the Atlantic and potential for damage to steel plates below the water line. (This picture predates the calling-into-question of the quality of rivets (metalurgy) which has since come to the fore.) The film also shows the class distinction and its impact as to whom - of the ""women and children first,"" got a seat in a boat; the fact that the first/earliest lifeboats launched were not at full capacity; and that the boats launched from the port and starboard side held to different criteria as to loading. The latter allows the viewer an inference as to the importance for crew and passenger alike as to lifeboat drills which were then (1912) neither required nor ever held aboard Titanic. One of several movies on the subject, it stands well the test-of-time for its ""just the facts"" approach in the telling and avoidance of conjecture or added melodrama.

                    Reasonably accurate account of the sinking on April 14, 1912 of the RMS Titanic, the luxury ocean liner that struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic on its maiden voyage. The ship was the height of luxury - certainly by those traveling in first class - and was widely reputed to be unsinkable. The film focuses mostly on the ship itself and the issues faced by Captain Smith, his crew and the passengers. The ship carried only enough lifeboats for half of the passengers and crew but even at that little more than a third of them survived. The film also recounts the activity on the Carpathia, which sailed to the survivors' rescue and the California which failed to recognize their distress signal.

As it starts to sink, the new invention of radio is used to try and summon help, although this is disastrously ignored by the closest vessel. With lifeboat places for only 1200 people, it is not only women and children first, but also First Class before Steerage.

                    It is 1912, and the White Star Line's new ship - the 'unsinkable' Titanic - is making its maiden voyage across the Atlantic from Southhampton to New York City. Unfortunately, the night of April 14-15, 1912 proves to be a night in which man's arrogant overconfidence in his technological creations was shaken to its core, as the legendary ship collides with an iceberg in the North Atlantic. The much-touted watertight compartment system that supposedly rendered it 'unsinkable' was never designed to cope with such extensive damage, and the Titanic is doomed. Focusing on the accounts of most of the real people who sailed on the ship, it centers largely on the experiences of the ship's 2nd officer, C.H. Lightholler. With these accounts come frightening revelations about the ship - not only are there way too few lifeboats, but people are loaded into them according to their class - First before Steerage. Based on the late Walter Lord's book of the same title.

                    Sixty-one year old widower Will Varner, in ill health, owns many businesses and property in Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi, including a plantation. To him, his children are a disappointment, they who he sees as not being able to carry on the Varner name in the style to which he has built around it. Son Jody Varner has no ambition and does not work, spending much of his time fooling around with his seductive wife, Eula. Twenty-three year old daughter Clara Varner he finds clever, but he feels she also wastes her time on more contemplative pursuits. While most of her contemporaries are married, Clara has been dating Alan Stewart, a genteel mama's boy, for six years. Will would not mind Alan so much if he too thought Alan had a bit of a forceful man in him, which he could demonstrate by actually asking Clara to marry him. Conversely, Jody laments that nothing he does is ever good enough for his father, while Clara plain does not like the way he treats them. Into their lives comes Ben Quick, who Jody hired while Will was hospitalized, Ben to do some sharecropping on currently vacant land. Despite Will believing the unsubstantiated stories that Ben burned down someone's barn as an act of vengeance, Will becomes to view Ben as the son he never had as he is much the same mold. As such, Will does whatever he can to get Ben to be part of the family to carry on the Varner name the way Will wants it be, which means marrying Clara. Through the process, Clara may come to a realization about what she really wants in life, while Jody does whatever he can to retain his position in the family.

A small village nestled between steep mountain peaks. The camera pans slowly to the top of Trollenberg Mountain's rugged face. A single small cloud clings to the side .Two climbers (Jeremy Longhurst and Anthony Parker) huddle together on a ledge overlooking the valley below as a third climber,  (Jack Taylor), calls to them from above. complains to them of a sudden bitter cold and a fog that has abruptly reduced visibility. He calls out to them that someone is coming in his direction, but that he can't make them out in the fog. He screams and falls past his fellows on the ledge below. Acting quickly they secure his rope and begin to pull him back up. As his motionless blood-stained body comes in view one of them Anthony Parker falls mute, staring in horror at what he sees. He falters, and as the other climber, Jeremy Longhurst, continues to pull against the weight the rope wears thin against the jagged rock face. The body falls unseen down the face of the cliff. Jeremy Longhurst, shouts at Anthony Parker, ""you idiot, we nearly had him."" Anthony Parker stares frozen and pale, ""Didn't you see? His head... it was torn off!""In the valley below a train speeds by through tall fir trees. As it approaches a tunnel mouth the film title races out of the tunnel toward the viewer, ""The Trollenberg Terror (1958),"" in jagged text, as the train plunges into the blackness of the tunnel. Stanley Black's music crescendos in suspense as the opening credits flash across the screen. The train emerges into daylight at the far end of the tunnel as the credits end.Two attractive young women,  and  (Jennifer Jayne and Janet Munro) on their way to Geneva, nap together in a non-descript cabin car aboard the train as a gentleman,  (Forrest Tucker), seated opposite them reads his newspaper. Anne stirs and Sarah wakes her from her nap, apparently disturbed by a dream she doesn't quite recall. Sarah directs Anne's attention to the mountain view outside the train cabin window. As she looks out toward Mount Trollenberg her cheerful smile melts into a seeming trance. She turns away from the window inexplicably shaken by something she has apparently seen and collapses into the arms of Alan Brooks, leading to an awkward introduction.The train's conductor wanders by, as they converse, announcing the next stop as Trollenberg. Anne announces that they must get off there to her sister's amazement. More shocking still Anne seems to know the town in great detail, though she has never been there, even naming the Hotel Europa as their destination, seemingly without having any way of knowing the hotel even exists. Sarah protests, but Anne insists, yet still completely unable to explain her knowledge of the town or the reason she feels compelled to stop there. Mr. Brooks retreats into an uncomfortable silence at the oddly tense exchange, as the train rolls into the station.A man enters the Trollenberg train station strolling briskly past scenic tourist wall posters of a lush valley overlooked by snow capped mountains. In the station lobby,  (Frederick Schiller), the proprietor of the Hotel Europa and the Mayor of Trollenberg, introduces himself, as Alan Brooks introduces him to the Pilgrim Sisters, Anne and Sarah. Sarah apologizes for and then thanks Herr Klein for him accommodating them without a reservation at the Europa and Herr Klein becomes uncomfortable with a nervous attempt to explain why his hotel isn't fully booked during his peak season, On the drive from the train station to the hotel Anne becomes distracted, and begins describing the recent death of the climber on Mt. Trollenberg. She seems to be babbling details she couldn't possibly know, yet Herr Klein is noticeably shaken by statements she pulls out of thin air. Herr Klein stumbles through a clumsy apology for both the death of the young climber and then an account by Anne of the mountain folk leaving the area in the belief that it is in some way cursed. It is revealed that this recent tragedy is not the first death on the mountain, and that it has become a common occurrence for those who venture there to disappear without a trace.The car approaches the hotel along a picturesque tree lined road. A balcony overlooks an immaculate garden at the front of a quaint gabled chalet with a small mazot outbuilding in the background. The scene is framed by the alps, half shrouded in mist. Amidst the beauty of the scene Alan Brooks and the Pilgrim Sisters exit the car. Anne seems unnerved by Mt. Trollenberg, looming above them in the landscape.Journalist,  (Laurence Payne), sips on his beer and smokes at the small bar as the group enters the hotel lobby.  (Colin Douglas) tends the bar and excuses himself to unload the car as Truscott introduces himself to the group. He seems to recognize the sisters from somewhere, though he is unable for the moment to place them. The sisters retire to their room, and Sarah opens the window on a view of Mt. Trollenberg. Anne looks out upon the scene and once again becomes transfixed, describing details of a hiking shack, and cable car of which she has no prior knowledge, as though looking out on the scene she is able to see features to distant to be visible, in more detail than mere description or memory, but as though she were there. She becomes frustrated with the reasons the mountain seems so familiar to her, electing at Sarah's suggestion to believe that she must have read about it in a travel brochure, rather than as Anne suspects, that she remembers it from scenes in a dream. Anne gazes out again at the mountain, this time silent but still haunted by her attraction to it and something terrifying that she is unable to recall.Truscott pays Mr. Brooks a visit in his room, exchanging pleasantries and small talk as Brooks unpacks his bags. Truscott's banal seeming banter gives way to subtle interrogation as Brooks' answers become more curious to him. As Brooks finishes unpacking his revolver is plainly visible, and Truscott's curiosity is whetted. Truscott suddenly recalls where he has seen Sarah and Anne before and reveals to Brooks' amusement that they are performers with a mind-reading act. Truscott, excuses himself to his own room down the hall, but fails to close the door to his room. As Brooks leaves his own room he overhears Truscott on the telephone, requesting that Brooks be checked out. Brooks shrugs it off, but puzzles for a moment. As he enters the lobby his contemplation is broken as he's greeted by geologist  (Stuart Saunders) and his mountain guide,  (Andrew Faulds) who are finalizing their plans to climb ""The Trollenberg.""  is intent on finding the reason behind the rash of deaths on the mountain and suspects that some peculiar mineral formation must be the problem, while  remains skeptical. Dewhurst buys a round of drinks for everyone as they wander down from their rooms, all except Anne, who has remained behind to have a quiet nap, Sarah seeming to be of the impression that her sister's strange behavior is the result of stress and over-work.Truscott admonishes Brett to ""mind his roping,"" and they begin an exchange concerning the terrible and peculiar death of the young climber the previous week. Truscott suggests that the rope had become tangled around the climbers neck, and had decapitated him. Hans reluctantly disagrees, and tells the room that the matter is more mysterious still, that the rope had been tied around the young climber's waist, and that the villagers did not share the opinion that it had decapitated him, but something else, something evil.As the gathering breaks up, Brooks hitches a ride with Brett and Dewhurst on the cable car on his way to ""The Observatory."" On the long cable-car ride up the mountain, Dewhurst explains his theory that chemical changes in the mountain rocks could be loosening or cracking them, making climbing the mountain a dangerous enterprise as Brett looks on unconvinced.The cosmic ray observatory is an imposing structure, more like a bunker than an academic facility. Massive, windowless concrete walls taper upward like the battlements of a fortress. The handrails of a long twisting stair can be seen winding up the ragged slope.In the laboratory  (Warren Mitchell) pours over the observatory's cosmic ray detector and flusters impatiently when interrupted by his assistant,  (Derek Sydney) informing him of a visitor. He greets Brooks at the observatory's entrance, a heavily reinforced steel door befitting the robust construction of the observatory itself. Even the observatory's single window is shielded by a huge steel shutter which the professor demonstrates. TV monitors provide the exterior view from a console inside, making the observatory proof against the worst avalanche imaginable.A cryptic conversation ensues between Brooks and the professor concerning the death of the student mountain climber, and many many other similar incidents in which, as the professor explains, no bodies had ever been found. Mysterious disappearances all in the same area of The Trollenberg. Brooks discounts them as the unfortunate but inevitable result of inexperienced climbers underestimating the dangers of the treacherous peak. The professor argues that Mt. Trollenberg has a single small cloud on its south face, which should not be there. Brooks is unimpressed but one senses that there is a hidden significance to the presence of the small cloud, ""where there are mountains there are always clouds,"" Brooks says, almost as though he is trying to convince himself. At least he seems skeptical until the professor reveals that this cloud never moves, and is radioactive. He demonstrates to Brooks using the observatory's cosmic ray detector, scanning the mountain, and each scan registering high radiation levels as the scanner passes the cloud. Their past association is revealed as the conversation turns to an incident three years prior in the Andes, where a similar pattern emerged. They shroud the nature of the incident as though reluctant to say in plain terms that they suspected a sinister cause. The professor urges Brooks to alert the authorities, but he's reluctant. The incident in the Andes damaged his credibility and was still an embarrassment to him. If no evidence were found to support him this time, he would look like a fool, and his career would likely end abruptly. Concerned but uncertain of a course of action he hesitates. ""This can't be the same. There are too many things missing,"" Brooks exclaims, ""mental compulsion..."" He stops in mid-sentence suddenly recalling Anne Pilgrim's strange attraction to Trollenberg and her odd behavior.Wilde interrupts, shouting across the laboratory room, ""there's climbers on The Trollenberg!"" His statement alarms Crevett and Brooks and they turn there attention to the climbers immediately. Professor Crevett activates the TV monitors and zooms in on the climbers as they ascend the mountain toward a small cabin. Brooks recognizes the geologist, Dewhurst and his guide, Brett.The professor presses Brooks to act on the situation, but Brooks is still reluctant. ""...I'm not going to stick my neck out again like I did in the Andes,"" he murmurs. ""...they practically accused me of dreaming the whole thing up. If I was to take a hand here, I'd have to have a list of documented facts, and they'd have to be pretty conclusive."" Brooks appears troubled. He seems to know that Crevett is right, yet his experience in the Andes has made him leery of the repercussions of making their theory public.Dewhurst and Brett arrive at the cabin without incident to the great relief of Brooks. The small cabin is little more than an eight foot by ten foot wooden shack of rough hewn planks set against a landscape of snowy mountain ridges. Brett enters followed by Dewhurst and after stowing his pack on the upper bunk at the back wall, begins a casual examination of the cabin's facilities, a few small pots and pans, an oil burning portable stove. Brett uses the cabin's primitive telephone to ring the Hotel Europa to inform Herr Klein of their safe arrival. It seems to reinforce the notion that the accidents have simply been a coincidence caused by a large number of careless climbers. Brooks and Crevett share his relief, but they obviously hold some doubt in reserve.Evening comes as Brett and Dewhurst settle in. Brett busies himself with notes of some kind as Dewhurst dozes in the lower bunk. Brett opens the cabin door and notes that visibility has declined. A small cloud has moved down the mountain and brought with it both thick fog and an intense chill.Meanwhile, in the lobby of the Hotel Europa, the Pilgrim Sisters are entertaining the guests with there mind-reading act. Anne correctly identifies a bank note reading off the serial number without ever seeing the note, to the delight of the onlookers. A second object is introduced. Anne correctly identifies it as a snow globe, describing the scene inside the small glass dome. As she begins to detail the small cabin in the scene, her trance becomes dark and disturbing. She is no longer describing the cabin in the snow globe but the cabin on the slopes of The Trollenberg where Brett and Dewhurst have camped for the night. She describes the two men in the cabin, as Brett himself seems to fall under some sort of trance. He leaves the cabin as if sleep walking, seemingly oblivious to having left the door open he walks off into the distance. Anne describes him coming up the slope and Dewhurst sleeping in the bunk. The guests become alarmed and her sister, Sarah becomes fearful of her sister's unexplained deviation from their act. Anne collapses as Brooks rushes to the phone. He calls the cabin and wakes Dewhurst. As Dewhurst assures Brooks that everything is quite alright and that Brett must have simply stepped out for a bit of air.Anne awakens in her bed with her sister, Truscott and Prof. Crevett watching over her. Crevett takes Sarah aside and insists that she must take Anne away from the area in the morning. Anne is sedated and left to sleep as the others return to the hotel lobby. Crevett comments to Brooks that in her trance, Anne had described Brett from the perspective not of the cabin, but from outside the cabin, as though observing him from further up the mountain slope.Crevett briefly interrogates Sarah and confirms that Anne is genuinely telepathic. He again insists that Sarah remove Anne from the area first thing in the morning, but is less than candid when she presses him for an explanation. The phone rings in the hotel lobby, and Crevett is called to speak to his assistant, Wilde. He alerts the professor that the strange radioactive cloud has begun to move slowly down the face of The Trollenberg toward the cabin and that its radioactivity has begun to increase. Crevett informs Brooks that the cloud has moved into the vicinity of the cabin and Brooks rushes to the phone. Dewhurst answers and confirms that Brett has not yet returned but that he can't see far outside do to the heavy fog. It has also become bitterly cold. As they converse he hears something outside the cabin. He checks the door, locking with door with a bar from the inside. However, it looks like the unseen danger has entered the cabin from a back door as Dewhurst begins to scream and Brooks cannot do anything but for listening to the screams in horror. The phone line goes dead leaving all at the Hotel Europa in panic and suspense.Once again the phone rings in the hotel lobby, as Wilde informs the professor that the cloud has begun to move away from the cabin again.Mayor Klein, Brooks, Truscott and several villagers gather just before dawn in the hotel lobby and prepare packs and ropes for a rescue expedition. Herr Klein calls for a search plane, but doesn't expect that it will arrive until later that morning.Anne stirs restlessly shortly after dawn, tossing in her sleep and muttering. She describes men coming up the mountain to the hut. Crevett and Sarah attempt to calm her. She returns to sleep and Sarah presses the professor once again for an explanation for her sister's behavior. This time hew does explain in closely guarded words that Anne is sensitive to the mental images that Sarah transmits to her during their act, but that like a radio receiver, her mind is now overwhelmed by the mental images projected by a much stronger mind.On the slopes of The Trollenberg, the rescue party arrives at the cabin. The door bolted from the inside. Herr Klein knocks and calls to the men he is certain must be inside. Brooks breaks the door in and finds the interior of the cabin frozen. Ice crystals glitter on the blankets on the bunks. They find Dewhurst under the bottom bunk, his head mysteriously missing.Sarah serves her sister breakfast in bed as she makes her intentions known that they depart Trollenberg immediately. Anne argues at first but appears to relent when Sarah insists. Sarah excuses herself to the lobby to make the arrangements and Anne once again falls into a trance in her absence. She gazes out the window at The Trollenberg, the small odd cloud clinging close to its face in the distance. She dresses in haste, as though possessed by a purpose.The search party prepares a litter and carries Dewhurst's body, Truscott discovers the broken phone lines, and Brooks examines them closely. They crumble at his touch crystallized by intense cold.Anne sneaks out of the hotel, leaving Sarah behind. She holds her head with her hands as if fighting off enormous pressure. She gazes up again to the cloud.as the search plane passes overhead. She heads off in the direction of the mountain.Two members of the search party  (Richard Golding) and  (George Herbert), greet the approaching search plane with a portable radio. They exchange map coordinates with the  (Garard Green) and begin their search for Brett.Sarah returns to the hotel room to find Anne missing along with her coat. As she searches for her out the window the cable car passes in the distance. Sarah rushes from the room to catch her as Anne stands in the cable car, her gaze locked ahead at The Trollenberg. Sarah rushes to the phone to alert the professor at the observatory that her sister is on her way up in the cable car.The search plane circles high above the slopes and the pilot radios the search party that he has sighted Brett, waving below. He reports Brett's position and heads off into the distance.Wilde meets Anne at the cable car platform and escorts her there under weak protest. (Richard Golding) and  (George Herbert) head to Brett's location and find his pack, but Brett himself doesn't seem to be around. As they examine the contents of the pack they find Dewhurst's severed head. Brett appears suddenly with a look of crazed homicidal lust in his eyes, wielding a climbing pick he attacks them, killing each of them in turn.The professor and Wilde busy themselves with measurements at the observatory as Anne sits quietly. She rises unnoticed and slips past them, sneaking to the massive steel entrance door. On opening the door however she is met by Brooks, Hans, Truscott and the returning members of the search party. She attempts to leave, but Brooks prevents her.Later back at the Hotel Europa, after returning Anne to her bed, Brooks and Professor Crevett discuss the strange radioactive cloud. Truscott interupts, and during the conversation that ensues reveals himself to be a journalist, investigating the mysterious deaths and disappearances. He also knows something of the incident in the Andes.He confronts them both about stories that they had attributed the strange events in the Andes to alien creatures. Brooks himself then reveals that his role in his position at the UN is part of a special taskforce to investigate possible alien invasions.Brett to everyone's amazement, wanders in as though nothing has happened. No longer crazed, but seems exhausted and complains that the temperature is too hot. Weak and uncoordinated his motor skills terribly damaged somehow, he attempts to pour himself a drink and spills brandy all over the bar. Anne wanders down from her room, and at the sight of her Brett resumes his crazed state, drawing a knife from his belt and lunges for her. Brooks punches him soundly and sends him spinning backward. His head strikes a bronze statue of a wolf, howling which gashes his head deeply. He collapses to the floor, but to the shock of Truscott and Sarah, the wound doesn't bleed. Brett is carried into the wine cellar where Professor Crevett stitches his forehead. They leave, locking him in the wine cellar while they discuss informing the UN of the situation and Brett's zombie like condition.Brett awakens and hides against the wine cellar door as Mayor Klein approaches. Herr Klein peers in through the small window in the door and Brett grabs him by the neck, killing him and retrieving the mayor's keys from his pocket. Hearing the commotion, Sarah stirs from her sleep and goes to investigate. Brett finds a large clever in the kitchen and shuffles toward the stairway to the bedrooms on the upper floor just as Sarah reaches the top of the stair and sees him, alerting Alan Brooks. Brett enters the sister's room as Sarah pounds on Brook's door in panic.Brooks appears behind Brett in the doorway as Anne awakens, Brett standing over her bed with the clever raised to strike. Anne screams as a single shot rings out and Brett falls to the floor, Brooks standing in the doorway, revolver in hand.Crevett and Brooks begin an examination of Brett's body noting a peculiar cast to his skin. Crevett instructs Hans to hold his oil lamp lower to allow a better view and as he does so the flesh of Brett's arm seems to vaporize, leaving only skeletal remains. Truscott bursts into the room and announces that the observatory has phoned to tell them that the radioactive cloud has begun to move down the mountain again, this time directly toward the village.Brooks decides that they should all head for the observatory due to the heavily fortified structure, but Hans panics and speeds off toward the valley straight into the path of the oncoming cloud. Brooks gathers the party and a number of villagers together and they head off to the cable car. As they leave, a  (Caroline Glaser) drops her toy ball in the hotel lobby.From the platform they watch the cloud pour down from The Trollenberg into the village below. It stops in front of the hotel. The toy ball lies on the floor in the middle of the lobby as wisps of frosty mist can be seen under the lobby door.The cable car arrives at the platform and as they party rushes to the car, a  (Anne Sharp) realizes her daughter is nowhere to be found. Brooks instructs Truscott to leave him behind if he doesn't return before the cloud heads toward them, and he heads back down toward the village and the hotel in search of the child.In the hotel lobby, the doors begin to shake and finally break inward revealing the horror outside. A massive bulbous creature with long sinuous tentacles and a single enormous eye presses against the frame of the door, peering and reaching about inside the lobby with its tentacles. The young girl enters the lobby from the side entrance unaware of the danger lurking a few meters away and retrieves her toy ball. The alien seizes her with a tentacle as Alan Brooks bursts in through the window pick-axe in hand. He severs the tentacle holding her and rushes her away as the alien wails in pain. They return to the cable car and begin the ascent to the observatory as mist begins to filter onto the cable car platform below. Frost begins to form on the cable car pulley and the cable car lurches violently as the mechanism begins to freeze. The cable car arrives at the observatory platform and Brooks rushes the passengers out, fearing the cable could snap at any moment.The thick steel door of the observatory opens and Wilde ushers the party inside, rushing Brooks and Truscott to the main laboratory while the villagers huddle in the entry hall. In the laboratory Crevett informs them that the cloud has broken up into separate clouds, four, then five, all moving toward the observatory.On the video monitor Hans appears at the door. Wilde goes to let him in and asks him what happened. Hans explains that he ran into the cloud on the road and turned around. He seems mildly confused and disoriented and complains that the room is too hot, grasping at the collar of his sweater. They leave Hans in the entry hall and return to the lab. Hans peers around the corner and meets Anne's gaze. A crazed look comes over him as Anne retreats quietly to the professor's office at the rear of the lab. (Theodore Wilhelm) the professor's other assistant sits at a large console and alerts the professor of a sudden drop in temperature on the platform outside. Brooks begins to puzzle out the need for cold by the creatures as well as those who have come under their control. He mentions that Brett complained of the heat in the hotel before attempting to kill Anne, and Wilde interupts that Hans also complained on the heat upon his unexpected return. The party rushes to locate Hans and find him in the office, his large hands wrapped tightly around Anne's neck. Truscott leaps onto Han's back and pries him off of her as Brooks enters the office. The two struggle with Hans as Anne lies motionless on the professor's desk. Finally Brooks stabs Hans with a letter opener and he collapses.In the lab Brooks orders an airstrike of firebombs to be dropped on the observatory, in the hope that the thick concrete structure will resist the intense heat. The party begins constructing improvised malatov cocktails as the mist begins to gather outside. The hideous aliens can be seen outside creeping slowly up the rocky slope toward the observatory.The professor calls Brooks to the video console as the aliens make their appearance. Brooks grabs one of the molotov cocktails and steps outside. Launching it at one of the creatures as it sheiks in a high pitched unearthly tone. Truscott follows suit and is grabbed from above by an alien tentacle. As he dangles above the ground Brooks launches another of the homemade incendiaries up toward the roof of the observatory. Truscott falls to the ground and the creature retreats with a piercing wail. Brooks and Truscott rush inside and seal the door.As the creatures freeze the cameras, rendering them blind, the UN airstike arrives and contacts the observatory for instructions.Sarah tends her still unconscious sister in the office as one of the creatures lurks outside the heavy wall. Behind them the wall begins to crack from the intense cold and a door sized chunk of concrete falls inward revealing the creature outside, tentacles waving trough the opening, grasping for Sarah and Anne. Brooks rushes in at the commotion, heedless of the danger in an attempt to rescue them from the clutches of the alien and is caught by a tentacle. Truscott follows ushering Sarah and Anne to the relative safety of the main lab as Brooks struggles.Truscott rushes to the lab and returns with another maltov cocktail which he hurls through the opening and Brooks frees himself from its grasp. They hasten to the lab and close the door.Hugo (uncredited role), another of the professors assistants, monitors the communications station and alerts Brooks to the approach of the fighter plane. He instructs the pilot to bomb the cloud covering the observatory.Overhead, ""Jolly Rodger"" squares his fighter plane up for his first pass and begins dropping his fire bombs.They frame the building in flames as they strike the roof and surround the building. The aliens shriek and lash about with their tentacles. He returns for a second pass and the creatures are engulfed in flame, blackening and crisping. The wailing subsides as the creatures perish in the flames.The building's once pristine exterior is piled with the blackened remains of the immense alien bodies, smoking in ruin, but still distinct enough in form to provide Alan Brooks and Professor Crevett with the validation of their theory. Disaster averted the townfolk have been saved from gruesome death and the Earth from alien invasion.The steel window shutter slides up, permitting sunlight into the lab once again, the smoking husk of an alien poised on the roof above it. From inside the lab the view of The Trollenberg is once again visible. Anne and Truscott scamper out the steel door together as if, suddenly relieved of the terror they have found a romantic interest in each other, as Brooks and Sarah remark in jest on whether Anne will be safe in his company. The sky is clear and the party rejoices. Crevett observes that for the first time in three years, The Trollenberg is free of clouds, and Brooks expresses his hope that it stays that way.The Trollenberg stands majestically in the background...The closing credits role.","
    
                    A remote mountain resort in Switzerland is invaded by horrible alien creatures that like to decapitate humans. The beings are also in telepathic communication with people and inhabit a mysterious, radioactive cloud at the base of the Trollenberg mountain.

    Synopsis
    The opening screen of Jimmy Sangster's screenplay adaptation of Peter Key's Associated Television (ATV) - Saturday Serial, The Trollenberg Terror (1956), presents a certification from the British Board of Film Censors clearing this film for audiences of 16 years or older.The scene opens on the Swiss Alps. A small village nestled between steep mountain peaks. The camera pans slowly to the top of Trollenberg Mountain's rugged face. A single small cloud clings to the side .Two climbers (Jeremy Longhurst and Anthony Parker) huddle together on a ledge overlooking the valley below as a third climber,  (Jack Taylor), calls to them from above. complains to them of a sudden bitter cold and a fog that has abruptly reduced visibility. He calls out to them that someone is coming in his direction, but that he can't make them out in the fog. He screams and falls past his fellows on the ledge below. Acting quickly they secure his rope and begin to pull him back up. As his motionless blood-stained body comes in view one of them Anthony Parker falls mute, staring in horror at what he sees. He falters, and as the other climber, Jeremy Longhurst, continues to pull against the weight the rope wears thin against the jagged rock face. The body falls unseen down the face of the cliff. Jeremy Longhurst, shouts at Anthony Parker, ""you idiot, we nearly had him."" Anthony Parker stares frozen and pale, ""Didn't you see? His head... it was torn off!""In the valley below a train speeds by through tall fir trees. As it approaches a tunnel mouth the film title races out of the tunnel toward the viewer, ""The Trollenberg Terror (1958),"" in jagged text, as the train plunges into the blackness of the tunnel. Stanley Black's music crescendos in suspense as the opening credits flash across the screen. The train emerges into daylight at the far end of the tunnel as the credits end.Two attractive young women,  and  (Jennifer Jayne and Janet Munro) on their way to Geneva, nap together in a non-descript cabin car aboard the train as a gentleman,  (Forrest Tucker), seated opposite them reads his newspaper. Anne stirs and Sarah wakes her from her nap, apparently disturbed by a dream she doesn't quite recall. Sarah directs Anne's attention to the mountain view outside the train cabin window. As she looks out toward Mount Trollenberg her cheerful smile melts into a seeming trance. She turns away from the window inexplicably shaken by something she has apparently seen and collapses into the arms of Alan Brooks, leading to an awkward introduction.The train's conductor wanders by, as they converse, announcing the next stop as Trollenberg. Anne announces that they must get off there to her sister's amazement. More shocking still Anne seems to know the town in great detail, though she has never been there, even naming the Hotel Europa as their destination, seemingly without having any way of knowing the hotel even exists. Sarah protests, but Anne insists, yet still completely unable to explain her knowledge of the town or the reason she feels compelled to stop there. Mr. Brooks retreats into an uncomfortable silence at the oddly tense exchange, as the train rolls into the station.A man enters the Trollenberg train station strolling briskly past scenic tourist wall posters of a lush valley overlooked by snow capped mountains. In the station lobby,  (Frederick Schiller), the proprietor of the Hotel Europa and the Mayor of Trollenberg, introduces himself, as Alan Brooks introduces him to the Pilgrim Sisters, Anne and Sarah. Sarah apologizes for and then thanks Herr Klein for him accommodating them without a reservation at the Europa and Herr Klein becomes uncomfortable with a nervous attempt to explain why his hotel isn't fully booked during his peak season, On the drive from the train station to the hotel Anne becomes distracted, and begins describing the recent death of the climber on Mt. Trollenberg. She seems to be babbling details she couldn't possibly know, yet Herr Klein is noticeably shaken by statements she pulls out of thin air. Herr Klein stumbles through a clumsy apology for both the death of the young climber and then an account by Anne of the mountain folk leaving the area in the belief that it is in some way cursed. It is revealed that this recent tragedy is not the first death on the mountain, and that it has become a common occurrence for those who venture there to disappear without a trace.The car approaches the hotel along a picturesque tree lined road. A balcony overlooks an immaculate garden at the front of a quaint gabled chalet with a small mazot outbuilding in the background. The scene is framed by the alps, half shrouded in mist. Amidst the beauty of the scene Alan Brooks and the Pilgrim Sisters exit the car. Anne seems unnerved by Mt. Trollenberg, looming above them in the landscape.Journalist,  (Laurence Payne), sips on his beer and smokes at the small bar as the group enters the hotel lobby.  (Colin Douglas) tends the bar and excuses himself to unload the car as Truscott introduces himself to the group. He seems to recognize the sisters from somewhere, though he is unable for the moment to place them. The sisters retire to their room, and Sarah opens the window on a view of Mt. Trollenberg. Anne looks out upon the scene and once again becomes transfixed, describing details of a hiking shack, and cable car of which she has no prior knowledge, as though looking out on the scene she is able to see features to distant to be visible, in more detail than mere description or memory, but as though she were there. She becomes frustrated with the reasons the mountain seems so familiar to her, electing at Sarah's suggestion to believe that she must have read about it in a travel brochure, rather than as Anne suspects, that she remembers it from scenes in a dream. Anne gazes out again at the mountain, this time silent but still haunted by her attraction to it and something terrifying that she is unable to recall.Truscott pays Mr. Brooks a visit in his room, exchanging pleasantries and small talk as Brooks unpacks his bags. Truscott's banal seeming banter gives way to subtle interrogation as Brooks' answers become more curious to him. As Brooks finishes unpacking his revolver is plainly visible, and Truscott's curiosity is whetted. Truscott suddenly recalls where he has seen Sarah and Anne before and reveals to Brooks' amusement that they are performers with a mind-reading act. Truscott, excuses himself to his own room down the hall, but fails to close the door to his room. As Brooks leaves his own room he overhears Truscott on the telephone, requesting that Brooks be checked out. Brooks shrugs it off, but puzzles for a moment. As he enters the lobby his contemplation is broken as he's greeted by geologist  (Stuart Saunders) and his mountain guide,  (Andrew Faulds) who are finalizing their plans to climb ""The Trollenberg.""  is intent on finding the reason behind the rash of deaths on the mountain and suspects that some peculiar mineral formation must be the problem, while  remains skeptical. Dewhurst buys a round of drinks for everyone as they wander down from their rooms, all except Anne, who has remained behind to have a quiet nap, Sarah seeming to be of the impression that her sister's strange behavior is the result of stress and over-work.Truscott admonishes Brett to ""mind his roping,"" and they begin an exchange concerning the terrible and peculiar death of the young climber the previous week. Truscott suggests that the rope had become tangled around the climbers neck, and had decapitated him. Hans reluctantly disagrees, and tells the room that the matter is more mysterious still, that the rope had been tied around the young climber's waist, and that the villagers did not share the opinion that it had decapitated him, but something else, something evil.As the gathering breaks up, Brooks hitches a ride with Brett and Dewhurst on the cable car on his way to ""The Observatory."" On the long cable-car ride up the mountain, Dewhurst explains his theory that chemical changes in the mountain rocks could be loosening or cracking them, making climbing the mountain a dangerous enterprise as Brett looks on unconvinced.The cosmic ray observatory is an imposing structure, more like a bunker than an academic facility. Massive, windowless concrete walls taper upward like the battlements of a fortress. The handrails of a long twisting stair can be seen winding up the ragged slope.In the laboratory  (Warren Mitchell) pours over the observatory's cosmic ray detector and flusters impatiently when interrupted by his assistant,  (Derek Sydney) informing him of a visitor. He greets Brooks at the observatory's entrance, a heavily reinforced steel door befitting the robust construction of the observatory itself. Even the observatory's single window is shielded by a huge steel shutter which the professor demonstrates. TV monitors provide the exterior view from a console inside, making the observatory proof against the worst avalanche imaginable.A cryptic conversation ensues between Brooks and the professor concerning the death of the student mountain climber, and many many other similar incidents in which, as the professor explains, no bodies had ever been found. Mysterious disappearances all in the same area of The Trollenberg. Brooks discounts them as the unfortunate but inevitable result of inexperienced climbers underestimating the dangers of the treacherous peak. The professor argues that Mt. Trollenberg has a single small cloud on its south face, which should not be there. Brooks is unimpressed but one senses that there is a hidden significance to the presence of the small cloud, ""where there are mountains there are always clouds,"" Brooks says, almost as though he is trying to convince himself. At least he seems skeptical until the professor reveals that this cloud never moves, and is radioactive. He demonstrates to Brooks using the observatory's cosmic ray detector, scanning the mountain, and each scan registering high radiation levels as the scanner passes the cloud. Their past association is revealed as the conversation turns to an incident three years prior in the Andes, where a similar pattern emerged. They shroud the nature of the incident as though reluctant to say in plain terms that they suspected a sinister cause. The professor urges Brooks to alert the authorities, but he's reluctant. The incident in the Andes damaged his credibility and was still an embarrassment to him. If no evidence were found to support him this time, he would look like a fool, and his career would likely end abruptly. Concerned but uncertain of a course of action he hesitates. ""This can't be the same. There are too many things missing,"" Brooks exclaims, ""mental compulsion..."" He stops in mid-sentence suddenly recalling Anne Pilgrim's strange attraction to Trollenberg and her odd behavior.Wilde interrupts, shouting across the laboratory room, ""there's climbers on The Trollenberg!"" His statement alarms Crevett and Brooks and they turn there attention to the climbers immediately. Professor Crevett activates the TV monitors and zooms in on the climbers as they ascend the mountain toward a small cabin. Brooks recognizes the geologist, Dewhurst and his guide, Brett.The professor presses Brooks to act on the situation, but Brooks is still reluctant. ""...I'm not going to stick my neck out again like I did in the Andes,"" he murmurs. ""...they practically accused me of dreaming the whole thing up. If I was to take a hand here, I'd have to have a list of documented facts, and they'd have to be pretty conclusive."" Brooks appears troubled. He seems to know that Crevett is right, yet his experience in the Andes has made him leery of the repercussions of making their theory public.Dewhurst and Brett arrive at the cabin without incident to the great relief of Brooks. The small cabin is little more than an eight foot by ten foot wooden shack of rough hewn planks set against a landscape of snowy mountain ridges. Brett enters followed by Dewhurst and after stowing his pack on the upper bunk at the back wall, begins a casual examination of the cabin's facilities, a few small pots and pans, an oil burning portable stove. Brett uses the cabin's primitive telephone to ring the Hotel Europa to inform Herr Klein of their safe arrival. It seems to reinforce the notion that the accidents have simply been a coincidence caused by a large number of careless climbers. Brooks and Crevett share his relief, but they obviously hold some doubt in reserve.Evening comes as Brett and Dewhurst settle in. Brett busies himself with notes of some kind as Dewhurst dozes in the lower bunk. Brett opens the cabin door and notes that visibility has declined. A small cloud has moved down the mountain and brought with it both thick fog and an intense chill.Meanwhile, in the lobby of the Hotel Europa, the Pilgrim Sisters are entertaining the guests with there mind-reading act. Anne correctly identifies a bank note reading off the serial number without ever seeing the note, to the delight of the onlookers. A second object is introduced. Anne correctly identifies it as a snow globe, describing the scene inside the small glass dome. As she begins to detail the small cabin in the scene, her trance becomes dark and disturbing. She is no longer describing the cabin in the snow globe but the cabin on the slopes of The Trollenberg where Brett and Dewhurst have camped for the night. She describes the two men in the cabin, as Brett himself seems to fall under some sort of trance. He leaves the cabin as if sleep walking, seemingly oblivious to having left the door open he walks off into the distance. Anne describes him coming up the slope and Dewhurst sleeping in the bunk. The guests become alarmed and her sister, Sarah becomes fearful of her sister's unexplained deviation from their act. Anne collapses as Brooks rushes to the phone. He calls the cabin and wakes Dewhurst. As Dewhurst assures Brooks that everything is quite alright and that Brett must have simply stepped out for a bit of air.Anne awakens in her bed with her sister, Truscott and Prof. Crevett watching over her. Crevett takes Sarah aside and insists that she must take Anne away from the area in the morning. Anne is sedated and left to sleep as the others return to the hotel lobby. Crevett comments to Brooks that in her trance, Anne had described Brett from the perspective not of the cabin, but from outside the cabin, as though observing him from further up the mountain slope.Crevett briefly interrogates Sarah and confirms that Anne is genuinely telepathic. He again insists that Sarah remove Anne from the area first thing in the morning, but is less than candid when she presses him for an explanation. The phone rings in the hotel lobby, and Crevett is called to speak to his assistant, Wilde. He alerts the professor that the strange radioactive cloud has begun to move slowly down the face of The Trollenberg toward the cabin and that its radioactivity has begun to increase. Crevett informs Brooks that the cloud has moved into the vicinity of the cabin and Brooks rushes to the phone. Dewhurst answers and confirms that Brett has not yet returned but that he can't see far outside do to the heavy fog. It has also become bitterly cold. As they converse he hears something outside the cabin. He checks the door, locking with door with a bar from the inside. However, it looks like the unseen danger has entered the cabin from a back door as Dewhurst begins to scream and Brooks cannot do anything but for listening to the screams in horror. The phone line goes dead leaving all at the Hotel Europa in panic and suspense.Once again the phone rings in the hotel lobby, as Wilde informs the professor that the cloud has begun to move away from the cabin again.Mayor Klein, Brooks, Truscott and several villagers gather just before dawn in the hotel lobby and prepare packs and ropes for a rescue expedition. Herr Klein calls for a search plane, but doesn't expect that it will arrive until later that morning.Anne stirs restlessly shortly after dawn, tossing in her sleep and muttering. She describes men coming up the mountain to the hut. Crevett and Sarah attempt to calm her. She returns to sleep and Sarah presses the professor once again for an explanation for her sister's behavior. This time hew does explain in closely guarded words that Anne is sensitive to the mental images that Sarah transmits to her during their act, but that like a radio receiver, her mind is now overwhelmed by the mental images projected by a much stronger mind.On the slopes of The Trollenberg, the rescue party arrives at the cabin. The door bolted from the inside. Herr Klein knocks and calls to the men he is certain must be inside. Brooks breaks the door in and finds the interior of the cabin frozen. Ice crystals glitter on the blankets on the bunks. They find Dewhurst under the bottom bunk, his head mysteriously missing.Sarah serves her sister breakfast in bed as she makes her intentions known that they depart Trollenberg immediately. Anne argues at first but appears to relent when Sarah insists. Sarah excuses herself to the lobby to make the arrangements and Anne once again falls into a trance in her absence. She gazes out the window at The Trollenberg, the small odd cloud clinging close to its face in the distance. She dresses in haste, as though possessed by a purpose.The search party prepares a litter and carries Dewhurst's body, Truscott discovers the broken phone lines, and Brooks examines them closely. They crumble at his touch crystallized by intense cold.Anne sneaks out of the hotel, leaving Sarah behind. She holds her head with her hands as if fighting off enormous pressure. She gazes up again to the cloud.as the search plane passes overhead. She heads off in the direction of the mountain.Two members of the search party  (Richard Golding) and  (George Herbert), greet the approaching search plane with a portable radio. They exchange map coordinates with the  (Garard Green) and begin their search for Brett.Sarah returns to the hotel room to find Anne missing along with her coat. As she searches for her out the window the cable car passes in the distance. Sarah rushes from the room to catch her as Anne stands in the cable car, her gaze locked ahead at The Trollenberg. Sarah rushes to the phone to alert the professor at the observatory that her sister is on her way up in the cable car.The search plane circles high above the slopes and the pilot radios the search party that he has sighted Brett, waving below. He reports Brett's position and heads off into the distance.Wilde meets Anne at the cable car platform and escorts her there under weak protest. (Richard Golding) and  (George Herbert) head to Brett's location and find his pack, but Brett himself doesn't seem to be around. As they examine the contents of the pack they find Dewhurst's severed head. Brett appears suddenly with a look of crazed homicidal lust in his eyes, wielding a climbing pick he attacks them, killing each of them in turn.The professor and Wilde busy themselves with measurements at the observatory as Anne sits quietly. She rises unnoticed and slips past them, sneaking to the massive steel entrance door. On opening the door however she is met by Brooks, Hans, Truscott and the returning members of the search party. She attempts to leave, but Brooks prevents her.Later back at the Hotel Europa, after returning Anne to her bed, Brooks and Professor Crevett discuss the strange radioactive cloud. Truscott interupts, and during the conversation that ensues reveals himself to be a journalist, investigating the mysterious deaths and disappearances. He also knows something of the incident in the Andes.
He confronts them both about stories that they had attributed the strange events in the Andes to alien creatures. Brooks himself then reveals that his role in his position at the UN is part of a special taskforce to investigate possible alien invasions.Brett to everyone's amazement, wanders in as though nothing has happened. No longer crazed, but seems exhausted and complains that the temperature is too hot. Weak and uncoordinated his motor skills terribly damaged somehow, he attempts to pour himself a drink and spills brandy all over the bar. Anne wanders down from her room, and at the sight of her Brett resumes his crazed state, drawing a knife from his belt and lunges for her. Brooks punches him soundly and sends him spinning backward. His head strikes a bronze statue of a wolf, howling which gashes his head deeply. He collapses to the floor, but to the shock of Truscott and Sarah, the wound doesn't bleed. Brett is carried into the wine cellar where Professor Crevett stitches his forehead. They leave, locking him in the wine cellar while they discuss informing the UN of the situation and Brett's zombie like condition.Brett awakens and hides against the wine cellar door as Mayor Klein approaches. Herr Klein peers in through the small window in the door and Brett grabs him by the neck, killing him and retrieving the mayor's keys from his pocket. Hearing the commotion, Sarah stirs from her sleep and goes to investigate. Brett finds a large clever in the kitchen and shuffles toward the stairway to the bedrooms on the upper floor just as Sarah reaches the top of the stair and sees him, alerting Alan Brooks. Brett enters the sister's room as Sarah pounds on Brook's door in panic.
Brooks appears behind Brett in the doorway as Anne awakens, Brett standing over her bed with the clever raised to strike. Anne screams as a single shot rings out and Brett falls to the floor, Brooks standing in the doorway, revolver in hand.Crevett and Brooks begin an examination of Brett's body noting a peculiar cast to his skin. Crevett instructs Hans to hold his oil lamp lower to allow a better view and as he does so the flesh of Brett's arm seems to vaporize, leaving only skeletal remains. Truscott bursts into the room and announces that the observatory has phoned to tell them that the radioactive cloud has begun to move down the mountain again, this time directly toward the village.Brooks decides that they should all head for the observatory due to the heavily fortified structure, but Hans panics and speeds off toward the valley straight into the path of the oncoming cloud. Brooks gathers the party and a number of villagers together and they head off to the cable car. As they leave, a  (Caroline Glaser) drops her toy ball in the hotel lobby.From the platform they watch the cloud pour down from The Trollenberg into the village below. It stops in front of the hotel. The toy ball lies on the floor in the middle of the lobby as wisps of frosty mist can be seen under the lobby door.The cable car arrives at the platform and as they party rushes to the car, a  (Anne Sharp) realizes her daughter is nowhere to be found. Brooks instructs Truscott to leave him behind if he doesn't return before the cloud heads toward them, and he heads back down toward the village and the hotel in search of the child.In the hotel lobby, the doors begin to shake and finally break inward revealing the horror outside. A massive bulbous creature with long sinuous tentacles and a single enormous eye presses against the frame of the door, peering and reaching about inside the lobby with its tentacles. The young girl enters the lobby from the side entrance unaware of the danger lurking a few meters away and retrieves her toy ball. The alien seizes her with a tentacle as Alan Brooks bursts in through the window pick-axe in hand. He severs the tentacle holding her and rushes her away as the alien wails in pain. They return to the cable car and begin the ascent to the observatory as mist begins to filter onto the cable car platform below. Frost begins to form on the cable car pulley and the cable car lurches violently as the mechanism begins to freeze. The cable car arrives at the observatory platform and Brooks rushes the passengers out, fearing the cable could snap at any moment.The thick steel door of the observatory opens and Wilde ushers the party inside, rushing Brooks and Truscott to the main laboratory while the villagers huddle in the entry hall. In the laboratory Crevett informs them that the cloud has broken up into separate clouds, four, then five, all moving toward the observatory.On the video monitor Hans appears at the door. Wilde goes to let him in and asks him what happened. Hans explains that he ran into the cloud on the road and turned around. He seems mildly confused and disoriented and complains that the room is too hot, grasping at the collar of his sweater. They leave Hans in the entry hall and return to the lab. Hans peers around the corner and meets Anne's gaze. A crazed look comes over him as Anne retreats quietly to the professor's office at the rear of the lab. (Theodore Wilhelm) the professor's other assistant sits at a large console and alerts the professor of a sudden drop in temperature on the platform outside. Brooks begins to puzzle out the need for cold by the creatures as well as those who have come under their control. He mentions that Brett complained of the heat in the hotel before attempting to kill Anne, and Wilde interupts that Hans also complained on the heat upon his unexpected return. The party rushes to locate Hans and find him in the office, his large hands wrapped tightly around Anne's neck. Truscott leaps onto Han's back and pries him off of her as Brooks enters the office. The two struggle with Hans as Anne lies motionless on the professor's desk. Finally Brooks stabs Hans with a letter opener and he collapses.In the lab Brooks orders an airstrike of firebombs to be dropped on the observatory, in the hope that the thick concrete structure will resist the intense heat. The party begins constructing improvised malatov cocktails as the mist begins to gather outside. The hideous aliens can be seen outside creeping slowly up the rocky slope toward the observatory.The professor calls Brooks to the video console as the aliens make their appearance. Brooks grabs one of the molotov cocktails and steps outside. Launching it at one of the creatures as it sheiks in a high pitched unearthly tone. Truscott follows suit and is grabbed from above by an alien tentacle. As he dangles above the ground Brooks launches another of the homemade incendiaries up toward the roof of the observatory. Truscott falls to the ground and the creature retreats with a piercing wail. Brooks and Truscott rush inside and seal the door.As the creatures freeze the cameras, rendering them blind, the UN airstike arrives and contacts the observatory for instructions.Sarah tends her still unconscious sister in the office as one of the creatures lurks outside the heavy wall. Behind them the wall begins to crack from the intense cold and a door sized chunk of concrete falls inward revealing the creature outside, tentacles waving trough the opening, grasping for Sarah and Anne. Brooks rushes in at the commotion, heedless of the danger in an attempt to rescue them from the clutches of the alien and is caught by a tentacle. Truscott follows ushering Sarah and Anne to the relative safety of the main lab as Brooks struggles.
Truscott rushes to the lab and returns with another maltov cocktail which he hurls through the opening and Brooks frees himself from its grasp. They hasten to the lab and close the door.Hugo (uncredited role), another of the professors assistants, monitors the communications station and alerts Brooks to the approach of the fighter plane. He instructs the pilot to bomb the cloud covering the observatory.Overhead, ""Jolly Rodger"" squares his fighter plane up for his first pass and begins dropping his fire bombs.
They frame the building in flames as they strike the roof and surround the building. The aliens shriek and lash about with their tentacles. He returns for a second pass and the creatures are engulfed in flame, blackening and crisping. The wailing subsides as the creatures perish in the flames.The building's once pristine exterior is piled with the blackened remains of the immense alien bodies, smoking in ruin, but still distinct enough in form to provide Alan Brooks and Professor Crevett with the validation of their theory. Disaster averted the townfolk have been saved from gruesome death and the Earth from alien invasion.The steel window shutter slides up, permitting sunlight into the lab once again, the smoking husk of an alien poised on the roof above it. From inside the lab the view of The Trollenberg is once again visible. Anne and Truscott scamper out the steel door together as if, suddenly relieved of the terror they have found a romantic interest in each other, as Brooks and Sarah remark in jest on whether Anne will be safe in his company. The sky is clear and the party rejoices. Crevett observes that for the first time in three years, The Trollenberg is free of clouds, and Brooks expresses his hope that it stays that way.The Trollenberg stands majestically in the background...The closing credits role.

While loading food and water, a magician named Sokourah (5) (Torin Thatcher) emerges from a mask-crowned stone portal, chased by a Cyclops with satyr's legs (created as a stop-motion model, like most of the non-human cast, by Ray Harryhausen). The wizard rubs a magic lamp and is helped by a boy genie, Baronni (Richard Eyer), (6) who creates a magic barrier between the Cyclops and Sinbad's crew, who escape, taking Sokourah with them. But the Cyclops throws a rock to sink their boat, and the lamp is lost: the Cyclops recovers it from the shallow surf.Now at sea, Sokourah tries to persuade Sinbad with a bagful of jewels into returning to Colossa to regain the magic lamp; but Sinbad's mission is to go to Bagdad and avert war with Chandra by marrying Parisa. Once in Bagdad, Sokourah tries to convince the Caliph (Alec Mango), to grant him a ship for an expedition to Colossa, also showing him designs for a giant crossbow. But the Caliph listens to Sinbad about the perils of returning to Colossa, and even after putting on a fantastic magic show during a feast for the Caliph and Parisa's father, the Sultan of Chandra (Harold Kasket), during which Sadi is transformed into a blue four-armed snake-woman which performs an exotic dance, Sokourah's request is denied. Sokourah then prophesies war between Chandra and Baghdad, which upsets the Caliph and the Sultan, and Sokourah is banished from the city.Sokourah steals into Parisa's bedchamber at night, and enchants her with the green smoke of a magic candle, which shrinks Parisa down to a few inches high. In the morning, Sadi discovers her and calls for the Caliph, Sinbad, and the Sultan: the Sultan becomes infuriated, vowing to avenge Parisa by laying waste to Bagdad.Sinbad seeks out Sokourah, and implores him to restore Parisa to her normal size, being apparently unaware that Sokourah was responsible for her miniaturization. Sokourah initially feigns helplessness, but finally concedes he can restore the Princess but he needs as a vital ingredient a piece of eggshell from the Roc (7), a giant bird that nests on the peaks of the Isle of Colossa. Sinbad now agrees to the voyage, and musters a crew partly from the condemned men from the Caliphs prison - a murderous rabble whose loyalty is questionable. Parisa journeys with Sinbad in a jeweled casket, and the giant crossbow is also made and loaded aboard.The crew mutiny once out at sea, and force Sinbad to yield by threatening Sokourah. They then lock up Sinbad, his loyal crew member Harufa and Sokourah, who curses the crew with madness: he knows that a storm will drive the ship towards rocks south of Colossa inhabited by wailing demons whose screams are unbearable: Sinbad saves his and his companions sanity by using waxed cloth to block their ears. The mutiny ringleader dies in a fall from the mast, and the men release Sinbad to save the ship. The ship and a more obedient crew arrive at Colossa.As the giant crossbow is assembled on the beach in front of the stone mask, Sinbad and Sokourah each lead a party through the Valley of the Cyclops, with Sinbad secretly (for a few minutes, at least) followed by his lieutenant, Harufa. Sinbads band discovers a giant spiked club and a store house full of treasure; though Sinbad tries to stop them, they become greedy trying to seize it: a Cyclops discovers them, hauls all five of them out, and locks them in a cage, from which it extracts Harufa whom it ties to a roasting-spit and starts to barbecue. Sokourah hears the shouts of Sinbad and the other trapped men, but does not release them, instead entering the treasure-chamber to find the magic lamp. Sinbad now reveals the tiny Princess Parisa, who manages to unfasten the cage's latch, enabling Sinbad and the men to escape. The four men who were with Sokourah, having become drunk on a stream flowing with wine, now attack: the Cyclops kills two by squashing them with an uprooted tree. During the following fight Sinbad manages to free Harufa, seize the lamp from Sokourah, and kill the Cyclops by first blinding him with a burning stake from the fire, and then leading him over a cliff, where the Cyclops falls to his death in the stream below.Sinbad is now suspicious of Sokourah, and refuses to let him have the lamp until Sokourah restores Parisa to her normal size. Sinbad, Sokourah, Harufa and the remaining three crewmen all climb a steep, rocky mountain (losing one man who falls off en route), until they find a giant egg. The two hungry crewmen break the egg with axes, releasing a two-headed yellow-down-covered Roc hatchling, which they kill and roast: Sinbad takes some of the eggshell. Parisa enters the lamp to speak with the genie, where he reveals to her his name, the magic words needed to use the lamp, which she passes onto Sinbad, and a prophecy which would free the genie to become, as he desires, a real boy - ""into fiery rock, to rise, you must fall"".Shortly an adult Roc appears, attacks the crew, knocking the two remaining crewmen off the mountain to fall to death, and carries Sinbad, unconscious, off to its nest. Sokourah seizes the opportunity to kill Sinbad's right-hand man Harufa with a spear, and takes Parisa prisoner. Sinbad escapes from the Roc's nest, and summoning the genie of the lamp, discovers that Parisa is being held in Sokourah's castle in a cave at the foot of the mountain. This is guarded by a chained wingless green fire-breathing horned Dragon, which Sinbad must bypass by winding in its chain on one of a pair of windlasses.At Sokourah's castle, Sinbad orders Sokourah at the point of a sword to restore Parisa to normal. Using the prepared potion, the piece of eggshell, and an incantation, Sokourah fills a large chest, into which the Princess has been placed, with green smoke, and Parisa becomes normal size again. However, Sinbad refuses to give up the lamp until he and the Princess are safely back at his ship: enraged, Sokourah animates a skeleton which, armed with scimitar and shield, fights Sinbad, he ultimately defeating it by pushing it off the top of a spiral staircase. Sokourah tries again to stop Sinbad and Parisa escaping by magically smashing a rock bridge over a channel of molten lava: the genie, summoned, helps them by materializing a rope they use to swing across the chasm to safety.Parisa realizes the chasm is the ""fiery rock"" mentioned in the prophecy of release for the genie, and casts the lamp into the lava flow, infuriating Sokourah. Sinbad and Parisa manage to sneak their way past Sokourah's guard Dragon, but another Cyclops enters the cave and blocks their way. Sinbad releases the Dragon by cutting the ropes of the windlass, enabling it to break its chain; the Dragon then fights and kills the Cyclops, biting its throat out. Sokourah follows shortly after, and with his dragon, chases Sinbad and Parisa back to the stone mask, where the giant crossbow is used to shoot the Dragon, which falls onto Sokourah, presumably killing him: the Dragon drags itself to the beach before expiring.As Sinbad and Parisa escape, back on board ship, Parisa calls Baronni by name he reappears, now a genie no longer but Sinbads cabin boy who has also thoughtfully filled Sinbad's cabin with the Cyclops' treasure, as a ""sort of a wedding present"".Notes (1) Spelling uncertain: historically, 'Chandra' is a Hindu lunar deity (2) This spelling of 'Parisa' is used p163 in 'The Art of Ray Harryhausen', by Ray Harryhausen and Tony Dalton, 2006, Billboard Books, New York (3) This spelling of 'Bagdad' rather than 'Baghdad' is used as a text overlay in the film, although the video sleeve has 'Baghdad' (and so may be unreliable on other points) (4) This spelling of 'Colossa' is used p162 in 'The Art of Ray Harryhausen' (5) Spelt 'Sokourah' in 'The Art of Ray Harryhausen' p 162 et. seq., and so used here, although the video sleeve has 'Sokurah': the role is not given in the title credits (6) Spelling uncertain, and could also be 'Birani' or any phonetic variant: in the title credits simply 'The Genie' (7)The roc or rukh is a giant bird in Persian mythology, probably inspired in part by the eggs or even sightings of the Aepyornis elephant bird, a now-extinct three-metre-tall flightless bird of Madagascar, for which there were reported sightings at least in folklore memory recorded in 1658. The eggs were known at least as early as 1420, according to a caption in the 1456 Fra Mauro map: Marco Polo also gave an account of the rukh in 1298.(Original version)The film begins with Sinbad and his crew sailing through a thick fog. They are enroute to Bagdad, returning from the Kingdom of Chandra with special booty, the Princess Parisa and her handmaid, Sadi. The ship must stop for supplies at the Island of Colossus. While loading supplies, a wizard named Sokurah emerges from a cave, chased by a cyclops. The wizard rubs a lamp and is helped by a boy genie. Sinbad's crew narrowly escapes the cyclops, taking Sokurah with them. But, the lamp is lost to the sea during the escape. The gigantic cyclops recovers its precious lamp from the shallow surf.Now at sea, Sokurah tries to bribe Sinbad into returning to Colossus and retaking the magic lamp, but Sinbad's primary mission is to go to Bagdad and avert war with Chandra by marrying Parisa. Once in Bagdad, Sokurah tries to convince Sinbad's uncle the Caliph to lend him a ship for an expedition to Colossus. But, the Caliph listens to Sinbad, and even after putting on a fantastic magic show before the Caliph of Bagdad and Parisa'a father, the Sultan of Chandra, Sokurah 's request is denied. During Sokurah's performance, he prophesies war between Chandra and Bagdad. The dark prophecies upset the Caliph and the Sultan, and Sokurah is bannished from the city.Sokurah steals into Parisa's bedchamber at night, and enchants her with the smoke of a magic candle, which shrinks Parisa down to the size of a small bird. In the morning, Parisa's handmaid discovers her enchantment. The Caliph, Sinbad, and Parisa's father the Sultan are shocked. The Sultan blames Bagdad, and becomes infuriated. He vows to avenge Parisa by laying waste to Bagdad.Sinbad seeks out Sokurah, and implores him to restore Parisa to her normal size. He is unaware, at this point, that Sokurah commited the treachery. Sokurah feigns helplessness, but finally concedes he may be able to help restore the Princess by using the egg shell from the Roc, a giant bird that lives on the Isle of Colossus. Sinbad agrees. He musters a crew from the prison. These are murderous, lecherous rabble whose loyalty is questionable.The crew proves unreliable once out at sea, where they mutiny and lock up Sinbad, crew and the magician Sokurah. Before they are locked in the hold, Sokurah curses the crew with a storm and madness. His curse plays out when a storm and the unbearable wail of sirens drives the crew mad. In their madness, they release Sinbad and his men to save the ship. The ship and a more obedient crew arrive at Colossus.The crew discover a store house full of treasure, and become greedy. Sinbad finds the magic lamp. The cyclops discovers them, and locks them in cages. It is soon learned the cyclops eats men. Sokurah has the opportunity to release the caged men, but leaves them behind without explanation. Sinbad reveals the tiny Princess Parisa to the men, who were unaware of her presence in a tiny tent crafted by the Royal Jeweler. Parisa manages to unfasten the cage's latch, and all escape. Parisa enters the lamp to speak with the genie, where he reveals to her his name and the magic words needed to use the lamp.Sinbad is now suspicious of Sokurah's intentions, but catches up with him. The magician is still needed to restore Parisa to her normal size. All the men climb a steep, rocky mountain, where they find pieces of the Roc's shell. The hungry men resort to killing a two-headed Roc hatchling for food. Later, while roasting the gigantic chick, the mother Roc appears, and carries Sinbad off to its nest. Sokurah seizes the opportunity to kill Sinbad's right-hand man Harufa, and takes Parisa. Sinbad escapes from the Roc's nest, and using the lamp, discovers that Parisa is being held in Sokurah's fortress in a cave.Sinbad finds the cave, and Parisa. He orders Sokurah at the point of a sword to restore Parisa to normal. Using the piece of shell and an incantation, Parisa becomes normal size again. But, Sokurah will not let Sinbad go with the lamp, and enchants a skeleton to life. Sinbad fights the skeleton, defeating it. He and Parisa narrowly escape Sokurah's chambers. There is another obstacle before them, a fiery chasm. The genie, whose name we learn is Baronni, helps Sinbad and Parisa one final time, by materializing a rope they use to swing across the chasm to safety.In an unselfish act, Parisa takes the lamp and casts it into the chasm of fire, for she recalls a promise of freedom, which read, ""Into the fire you must go."" Sinbad and Parisa manage to sneak their way past Sokurah's guard dragon, but another cyclops enters the cave and blocks their way. Sinbad helps the dragon to escape its iron collar, and the dragon and cyclops engage in battle. Sinbad and Parisa escape the cave, and the dragon kills the cyclops. Sokurah follows shortly after, and with his dragon, chases Sinbad, Parisa and the crew.The crew have one more weapon, a giant crossbow, which was originally intended for the cyclops. The crew unleash the arrow on the dragon, which falls to its death, also crushing Sokurah. The crew escape. Parisa is restored, but they have no lamp. Parisa affectionately remembers Baronni, and mentions his name.""Did someone call Baronni? Here I am!"" It is Baronni, no longer the genie, but Captain Sinbad's cabin boy. In his final act of magic, Baronni fills Sinbad's cabin with the Cyclops' treasure, ""as a sort of a wedding present."" The ship is safely on its way back to Bagdad.","
    
                    While sailing with Princess Parisa to Baghdad to their wedding, Sinbad finds the Colossa Island and anchors his vessel to get supplies for the starving crew. Sinbad and his men help the magician Sokurah to escape from a Cyclops that attacks them, and Sokurah uses a magic lamp with a boy jinni to help them; however, their boat sinks and he loses the lamp. Sokurah offers a small fortune to Sinbad to return to Colossa, but he does not accept and heads to Baghdad. The citizens and the Caliph of Baghdad are celebrating the peace with Chandra, and they offer a feast to the Sultan of Chandra. Sakurah requests a ship and crew to return to Colossa but the Caliph refuses to jeopardize his countrymen. However, the treacherous magician shrinks the princess and when the desperate Sinbad seeks him out, he tells that he needs to return to Colossa to get the ingredient necessary for the magic potion. But Sinbad has only his friend Harufa to travel with him, and he decides to enlist a doubtful crew in the prison of Baghdad, in the beginning of his dangerous voyage to Colossa to save the princess and avoid the eminent war between Chandra and Baghdad.

They then lock up Sinbad, his loyal crew member Harufa and Sokourah, who curses the crew with madness: he knows that a storm will drive the ship towards rocks south of Colossa inhabited by wailing demons whose screams are unbearable: Sinbad saves his and his companions sanity by using waxed cloth to block their ears. The mutiny ringleader dies in a fall from the mast, and the men release Sinbad to save the ship. The ship and a more obedient crew arrive at Colossa.As the giant crossbow is assembled on the beach in front of the stone mask, Sinbad and Sokourah each lead a party through the Valley of the Cyclops, with Sinbad secretly (for a few minutes, at least) followed by his lieutenant, Harufa. Sinbads band discovers a giant spiked club and a store house full of treasure; though Sinbad tries to stop them, they become greedy trying to seize it: a Cyclops discovers them, hauls all five of them out, and locks them in a cage, from which it extracts Harufa whom it ties to a roasting-spit and starts to barbecue. Sokourah hears the shouts of Sinbad and the other trapped men, but does not release them, instead entering the treasure-chamber to find the magic lamp. Sinbad now reveals the tiny Princess Parisa, who manages to unfasten the cage's latch, enabling Sinbad and the men to escape. The four men who were with Sokourah, having become drunk on a stream flowing with wine, now attack: the Cyclops kills two by squashing them with an uprooted tree. During the following fight Sinbad manages to free Harufa, seize the lamp from Sokourah, and kill the Cyclops by first blinding him with a burning stake from the fire, and then leading him over a cliff, where the Cyclops falls to his death in the stream below.Sinbad is now suspicious of Sokourah, and refuses to let him have the lamp until Sokourah restores Parisa to her normal size. Sinbad, Sokourah, Harufa and the remaining three crewmen all climb a steep, rocky mountain (losing one man who falls off en route), until they find a giant egg. The two hungry crewmen break the egg with axes, releasing a two-headed yellow-down-covered Roc hatchling, which they kill and roast: Sinbad takes some of the eggshell. Parisa enters the lamp to speak with the genie, where he reveals to her his name, the magic words needed to use the lamp, which she passes onto Sinbad, and a prophecy which would free the genie to become, as he desires, a real boy - ""into fiery rock, to rise, you must fall"".Shortly an adult Roc appears, attacks the crew, knocking the two remaining crewmen off the mountain to fall to death, and carries Sinbad, unconscious, off to its nest. Sokourah seizes the opportunity to kill Sinbad's right-hand man Harufa with a spear, and takes Parisa prisoner. Sinbad escapes from the Roc's nest, and summoning the genie of the lamp, discovers that Parisa is being held in Sokourah's castle in a cave at the foot of the mountain. This is guarded by a chained wingless green fire-breathing horned Dragon, which Sinbad must bypass by winding in its chain on one of a pair of windlasses.At Sokourah's castle, Sinbad orders Sokourah at the point of a sword to restore Parisa to normal. Using the prepared potion, the piece of eggshell, and an incantation, Sokourah fills a large chest, into which the Princess has been placed, with green smoke, and Parisa becomes normal size again. However, Sinbad refuses to give up the lamp until he and the Princess are safely back at his ship: enraged, Sokourah animates a skeleton which, armed with scimitar and shield, fights Sinbad, he ultimately defeating it by pushing it off the top of a spiral staircase. Sokourah tries again to stop Sinbad and Parisa escaping by magically smashing a rock bridge over a channel of molten lava: the genie, summoned, helps them by materializing a rope they use to swing across the chasm to safety.Parisa realizes the chasm is the ""fiery rock"" mentioned in the prophecy of release for the genie, and casts the lamp into the lava flow, infuriating Sokourah. Sinbad and Parisa manage to sneak their way past Sokourah's guard Dragon, but another Cyclops enters the cave and blocks their way. Sinbad releases the Dragon by cutting the ropes of the windlass, enabling it to break its chain; the Dragon then fights and kills the Cyclops, biting its throat out. Sokourah follows shortly after, and with his dragon, chases Sinbad and Parisa back to the stone mask, where the giant crossbow is used to shoot the Dragon, which falls onto Sokourah, presumably killing him: the Dragon drags itself to the beach before expiring.As Sinbad and Parisa escape, back on board ship, Parisa calls Baronni by name he reappears, now a genie no longer but Sinbads cabin boy who has also thoughtfully filled Sinbad's cabin with the Cyclops' treasure, as a ""sort of a wedding present"".Notes (1) Spelling uncertain: historically, 'Chandra' is a Hindu lunar deity (2) This spelling of 'Parisa' is used p163 in 'The Art of Ray Harryhausen', by Ray Harryhausen and Tony Dalton, 2006, Billboard Books, New York (3) This spelling of 'Bagdad' rather than 'Baghdad' is used as a text overlay in the film, although the video sleeve has 'Baghdad' (and so may be unreliable on other points) (4) This spelling of 'Colossa' is used p162 in 'The Art of Ray Harryhausen' (5) Spelt 'Sokourah' in 'The Art of Ray Harryhausen' p 162 et. seq., and so used here, although the video sleeve has 'Sokurah': the role is not given in the title credits (6) Spelling uncertain, and could also be 'Birani' or any phonetic variant: in the title credits simply 'The Genie' (7)The roc or rukh is a giant bird in Persian mythology, probably inspired in part by the eggs or even sightings of the Aepyornis elephant bird, a now-extinct three-metre-tall flightless bird of Madagascar, for which there were reported sightings at least in folklore memory recorded in 1658. The eggs were known at least as early as 1420, according to a caption in the 1456 Fra Mauro map: Marco Polo also gave an account of the rukh in 1298.(Original version)The film begins with Sinbad and his crew sailing through a thick fog. They are enroute to Bagdad, returning from the Kingdom of Chandra with special booty, the Princess Parisa and her handmaid, Sadi. The ship must stop for supplies at the Island of Colossus. While loading supplies, a wizard named Sokurah emerges from a cave, chased by a cyclops. The wizard rubs a lamp and is helped by a boy genie. Sinbad's crew narrowly escapes the cyclops, taking Sokurah with them. But, the lamp is lost to the sea during the escape. The gigantic cyclops recovers its precious lamp from the shallow surf.Now at sea, Sokurah tries to bribe Sinbad into returning to Colossus and retaking the magic lamp, but Sinbad's primary mission is to go to Bagdad and avert war with Chandra by marrying Parisa. Once in Bagdad, Sokurah tries to convince Sinbad's uncle the Caliph to lend him a ship for an expedition to Colossus. But, the Caliph listens to Sinbad, and even after putting on a fantastic magic show before the Caliph of Bagdad and Parisa'a father, the Sultan of Chandra, Sokurah 's request is denied. During Sokurah's performance, he prophesies war between Chandra and Bagdad. The dark prophecies upset the Caliph and the Sultan, and Sokurah is bannished from the city.Sokurah steals into Parisa's bedchamber at night, and enchants her with the smoke of a magic candle, which shrinks Parisa down to the size of a small bird. In the morning, Parisa's handmaid discovers her enchantment. The Caliph, Sinbad, and Parisa's father the Sultan are shocked. The Sultan blames Bagdad, and becomes infuriated. He vows to avenge Parisa by laying waste to Bagdad.Sinbad seeks out Sokurah, and implores him to restore Parisa to her normal size. He is unaware, at this point, that Sokurah commited the treachery. Sokurah feigns helplessness, but finally concedes he may be able to help restore the Princess by using the egg shell from the Roc, a giant bird that lives on the Isle of Colossus. Sinbad agrees. He musters a crew from the prison. These are murderous, lecherous rabble whose loyalty is questionable.The crew proves unreliable once out at sea, where they mutiny and lock up Sinbad, crew and the magician Sokurah. Before they are locked in the hold, Sokurah curses the crew with a storm and madness. His curse plays out when a storm and the unbearable wail of sirens drives the crew mad. In their madness, they release Sinbad and his men to save the ship. The ship and a more obedient crew arrive at Colossus.The crew discover a store house full of treasure, and become greedy. Sinbad finds the magic lamp. The cyclops discovers them, and locks them in cages. It is soon learned the cyclops eats men. Sokurah has the opportunity to release the caged men, but leaves them behind without explanation. Sinbad reveals the tiny Princess Parisa to the men, who were unaware of her presence in a tiny tent crafted by the Royal Jeweler. Parisa manages to unfasten the cage's latch, and all escape. Parisa enters the lamp to speak with the genie, where he reveals to her his name and the magic words needed to use the lamp.Sinbad is now suspicious of Sokurah's intentions, but catches up with him. The magician is still needed to restore Parisa to her normal size. All the men climb a steep, rocky mountain, where they find pieces of the Roc's shell. The hungry men resort to killing a two-headed Roc hatchling for food. Later, while roasting the gigantic chick, the mother Roc appears, and carries Sinbad off to its nest. Sokurah seizes the opportunity to kill Sinbad's right-hand man Harufa, and takes Parisa. Sinbad escapes from the Roc's nest, and using the lamp, discovers that Parisa is being held in Sokurah's fortress in a cave.Sinbad finds the cave, and Parisa. He orders Sokurah at the point of a sword to restore Parisa to normal. Using the piece of shell and an incantation, Parisa becomes normal size again. But, Sokurah will not let Sinbad go with the lamp, and enchants a skeleton to life. Sinbad fights the skeleton, defeating it. He and Parisa narrowly escape Sokurah's chambers. There is another obstacle before them, a fiery chasm. The genie, whose name we learn is Baronni, helps Sinbad and Parisa one final time, by materializing a rope they use to swing across the chasm to safety.In an unselfish act, Parisa takes the lamp and casts it into the chasm of fire, for she recalls a promise of freedom, which read, ""Into the fire you must go."" Sinbad and Parisa manage to sneak their way past Sokurah's guard dragon, but another cyclops enters the cave and blocks their way. Sinbad helps the dragon to escape its iron collar, and the dragon and cyclops engage in battle. Sinbad and Parisa escape the cave, and the dragon kills the cyclops. Sokurah follows shortly after, and with his dragon, chases Sinbad, Parisa and the crew.The crew have one more weapon, a giant crossbow, which was originally intended for the cyclops. The crew unleash the arrow on the dragon, which falls to its death, also crushing Sokurah. The crew escape. Parisa is restored, but they have no lamp. Parisa affectionately remembers Baronni, and mentions his name.""Did someone call Baronni? Here I am!"" It is Baronni, no longer the genie, but Captain Sinbad's cabin boy. In his final act of magic, Baronni fills Sinbad's cabin with the Cyclops' treasure, ""as a sort of a wedding present."" The ship is safely on its way back to Bagdad.

                    Mame is an unconventional individualist socialite from the roaring 20's. When her brother dies, she is forced to raise her nephew Patrick. However, Patrick's father has designated an executor to his will to protect the boy from absorbing too much of Mame's rather unconventional perspective. Patrick and Mame become devoted to each other in spite of this restriction, and together journey through Patrick's childhood and the great depression, amidst some rather zaney adventures.

                    On September 15, 1928, the day after he executes his will, wealthy conservative Chicago businessman Edwin Dennis unexpectedly passes away. As stipulated in the will, his ten-year old son Patrick Dennis, who is the sole heir to the estate, becomes the ward of their only living relative, Edwin's equally wealthy New York residing spinster sister, Mame Dennis. Edward's will states that Mr. Dwight Babcock with the Knickerbocker Bank, will act as trustee. He will pay Mame for expenses incurred in raising Patrick, he to use his power of discretion to ensure that Patrick does not inherit any of ""crazy"" Mame's ""damned eccentric"" ideas, flamboyant and free wheeling Mame who can be considered anything but traditional or conventional. Patrick's longtime nanny, Norah Muldoon, is to accompany Patrick to New York and continue her services. Despite the disruption each provides in the other's life, Mame and Patrick form a loving, supportive relationship. Mame wants to provide her sense of guidance to Patrick, which means exposing him to a broad spectrum of all that life has to offer. That changes when Mr. Babcock learns what is going on, and the stock market crashes resulting in Mame losing all her money, the events in combination leading to Mr. Babcock taking Patrick away to enroll him in boarding school away from Mame's daily influence. Although not for herself, Mame realizes that she needs money to get Patrick back and support who she considers her entire family, which includes Norah and her faithful butler, Ito. She may get a little help in the matter from her best friend, Broadway actress Vera Charles, and a southerner she meets named Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside. Over the next several years, Mame's influence on those around her, including Patrick, is presented, although those relationships are not always smooth sailing, especially as Patrick grows into a man who has been largely influenced by conservative Mr. Babcock's direction for him.

When Ms. Lawson has an accident and dies, Gladys has no money to run the establishment and accepts the position of ""foot inspector"" offered by the Mandarin Hsien Chang. She is assigned to visit the countryside to promote and enforce the government's law against foot binding Chinese girls. She is successful, changes her nationality to Chinese and her name to Jen-ai (meaning ""the one who loves people""), surprising the skeptical bi-racial Captain Lin Nan.

                    It's pre-WWII Britain. Gladys Aylward, who has worked as a domestic for the better part of her adult life, knows that she belongs in China, despite not knowing the language or anything of life there. She wants to work as a missionary, but is denied because of her inexperience. She even plans to save enough money on her own to go there. Instead, her current employer, Sir Francis Jamison, connects her with a friend of his, the elderly Mrs. Jeannie Lawson, a missionary in China who could use some help. When Gladys arrives in the remote northern Chinese town of Yang Cheng where Mrs. Lawson is currently residing, Mrs. Lawson tells her of her plan: to open an inn, which she ultimately calls the Inn of the Sixth Happiness, which will provide refuge for those traveling by mule train. In this way, they can spread the word of the Lord more effectively. Soon after they open the inn, Mrs. Lawson dies in an accident. With no money, no support to remain in China and still not enough language skills to make it on her own, Gladys has to find a way to stay. That help comes in the form of the mandarin of Yang Cheng, who employs her initially as the foot inspector, the job which entails monitoring the new government rule that young women and female children are not to have their feet bound (the mandarin failing to tell her the dangers of the job in bucking Chinese historical practice). In her travels, Gladys becomes renowned in the area as a humanitarian and is given the name ""the one who loves"". Despite potential harm to herself and fear for her personal safety, Gladys often places herself in situations where she feels she can provide some good, such as in negotiating with incarcerated men who have started a prison riot, and with marauding bandits. Through it all, she begins a friendship and ultimate romance with Colonel Lin Nan, a half Chinese/half Caucasian Chinese military officer who chose to live in China since he knew he would always be considered second class in the western world. Their friendship and romance is despite their differences, especially his military role versus her pacifist attitude. Those differences are tested with his message to the people of the probable Japanese invasion and what ultimately would become the Sino-Japanese War, when her mission turns to save the masses of orphaned children.

"23","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051378/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","This is an excellent example of ""theatre of the absurd"", filmed as a ""film noir"" suspense thriller. ""Theatre of the absurd"" posits that the universe is a random entity where nothing is likely to happen as expected. I believe Camus and other French writers of his era were the principle exponents of this view of life. Well, here we have certainly an example.A businessman (Julien Tavernier, played by Maurice Ronet), in love with his boss's wife (Florence Carala, played by Jeanne Moreau), plans a murder to look like suicide. This involves using a grappling hook and rope to enable him to climb up a floor without using the elevator. So far, so good. The boss is duly murdered, our ""hero"" climbs back down, takes the elevator down, and then realises he has left the rope dangling. Well, back up in the elevator, but alas, the building custodian shuts off the power, stopping the elevator between floors. Frantic (also an alternate title along with ""Elevator to the Gallows""), our man tries to escape, but he is truly trapped.Meanwhile, at street level, things are not going well for the man's inamorata. She is wandering around wondering what happened to her man, and is ""vagged"" by the gendarmes for not having her ID papers. There's more. A pair of wandering teenage lovers (Louis and Veronique, played by Georges Poujouly and Yori Bertin), decide to steal the man's car. They know who he is, and freely use his name while committing a few other crimes of their own. Such as stealing a Mercedes 300SL, and murdering the owner and his wife in the process.

    Synopsis
    This is an excellent example of ""theatre of the absurd"", filmed as a ""film noir"" suspense thriller. ""Theatre of the absurd"" posits that the universe is a random entity where nothing is likely to happen as expected. I believe Camus and other French writers of his era were the principle exponents of this view of life. Well, here we have certainly an example.A businessman (Julien Tavernier, played by Maurice Ronet), in love with his boss's wife (Florence Carala, played by Jeanne Moreau), plans a murder to look like suicide. This involves using a grappling hook and rope to enable him to climb up a floor without using the elevator. So far, so good. The boss is duly murdered, our ""hero"" climbs back down, takes the elevator down, and then realises he has left the rope dangling. Well, back up in the elevator, but alas, the building custodian shuts off the power, stopping the elevator between floors. Frantic (also an alternate title along with ""Elevator to the Gallows""), our man tries to escape, but he is truly trapped.Meanwhile, at street level, things are not going well for the man's inamorata. She is wandering around wondering what happened to her man, and is ""vagged"" by the gendarmes for not having her ID papers. There's more. A pair of wandering teenage lovers (Louis and Veronique, played by Georges Poujouly and Yori Bertin), decide to steal the man's car. They know who he is, and freely use his name while committing a few other crimes of their own. Such as stealing a Mercedes 300SL, and murdering the owner and his wife in the process. When the man finally does get out of the elevator after the power is restored in the morning, he discovers that.... But that would be telling, and you will want to find out for yourself. In any case, I have told enough to show that for the protagonist of this tale, the universe is truly a place not to be trusted at all!

Hulot has taken his young nephew under his wing allowing him to play with other children. The boy's parents live in a ultra-modern house where the boy's overly pretentious mother will barely let him breathe.

                    It's all about appearance for the highly regimented Arpels. They live in an ultra modern house, equipped with all the latest automated conveniences. They've decorated the property in a minimalist theme. And the fish fountain in the yard has to be turned on before anyone of importance is allowed on the property. The house is not very child friendly. Hence, their son, Gerard, prefers to spend time with his uncle, M. Hulot, who lives a more lackadaisical lifestyle in a smallish flat in an old building in a older established neighborhood. M. Arpel in particular doesn't like the influence his brother-in-law has on his son. The Arpels try to make M. Hulot more of a person in their own mold. M. Arpel gets his brother-in-law a job at his factory, and Mme. Arpel hosts a garden party, hoping to match her brother with her equally style conscious neighbor. As both the work and social situation are contrary to M. Hulot's general bumbling nature, neither turns out quite the way the Arpels plan. But M. Hulot may have more of a positive effect on the Arpels than they realize.

We open in the broadcast studio of KRKR-TV and the newsman (an uncredited Dale Tate) reporting on the worldwide sightings of a UFO. Referring to a globe, he traces the cities reporting and concludes, ""The stranger from space should be over our California desert in a matter of minutes."" A 1958 Chrysler Imperial races down US Route 66. A large spherical object comes into frame and sets down on the highway causing the car to first swerve, then stop. Behind the wheel is a very drunk and distraught Nancy Fowler Archer (Allison Hayes). She screams while trying to start her car. She gets out and is menaced by a huge hand while screaming, ""No! No!"" She is clutching a large diamond pendant around her neck. She escapes and runs down the road. In Tony's Bar and Grill, we meet Nancy's philandering husband, Harry (William Hudson) and his latest gold digging girlfriend, the aptly named, Honey Parker (Yvette Vickers). Harry and Honey are getting intimate. Harry tells Honey that returning to his wife after their separation was a mistake, but he needed the cash, and Nancy is loaded. She is worth about $50 million. ""A man hasn't got a chance,"" Harry concludes regarding community property. ""Unless the wife dies,"" Honey reminds him. Harry registers visible shock, so Honey backs off. Another thought comes to mind--recommit Nancy to the nut house. At that Nancy runs into the parking lot and is intercepted by Deputy Charlie (Frank Chase). The commotion stirs Sheriff Dubbitt (George Douglas). The sheriff clears the crowd and mindful of Nancy's money and influence handles the situation with kid gloves. He sends his deputy to find Harry. When Dubbitt suggests black coffee, Nancy reacts with rage and anger, ""Black Coffee? You think I'm drunk, don't you?"" She pleads, ""You've got to believe me. It was right in the middle of the highway, thirty feet tall. It lit up the sky. You don't believe me, do you?""Charlie finds Harry and Honey in a booth necking. He reluctantly interrupts the couple. He accepts a monetary gratuity from Harry who adds, ""You couldn't find me tonight, Charlie. I took a cab home."" The sheriff directs Charlie to, ""Go get the riot gun. We're taking a ride in the desert with Mrs. Archer."" The three drive off in pursuit of Mrs. Archer's giant and satellite. All they find is Mrs. Archer's car. They make a cursory search to humor Mrs. Archer, but of course find nothing. Angry and frustrated, Nancy gets in her car and drives off. At the Archer estate, Nancy drives up and enters the house. She is greeted by her butler, Jess Stout (Ken Terrell). Nancy immediately heads for the bar to make herself a drink. Harry is laying on the couch and suggests to Jess to, ""Beat it out of here."" Jess only responds to orders from his boss, Nancy. Nancy tells her unfaithful husband he can go too, but he reminds her of her embarrassing episode with the police. They fight over his philandering and her alcoholism, but ultimately Nancy loves her husband and wants their marriage to work. She tells him of her roadside encounter with the satellite. She pleads with Harry to believe her story. He puts her to bed, gives her a sedative, snags her diamond pendant, then heads back to Tony's to see Honey Parker.Back at Tony's, Deputy Charlie and Honey are dancing. Tony (Michael Ross) is serving drinks at the bar. Charlie excuses himself when Harry arrives. He is annoyed that Honey wasn't at the hotel. Honey is even more annoyed by that, ""Fleabag you call a hotel and I'm tired of waiting."" Harry tells Honey his wife is cracking up and shows her the diamond, the Star of India, as an inducement to bide her time and stay the course.Dr. Isaac Cushing (Roy Gordon) makes a house call on his richest patient. ""She's not well, Harry,"" is the doctor's conclusion. Cushing adds, ""She's suffering from mental exhaustion, and her drinking doesn't help her any."" The doctor leaves as Nancy walks down the stairs from her room. They resume their fight about his activities, thanks to updates from Jess, and her delusion about a giant and a satellite. Harry returns her diamond pendant then walks upstairs. While Nancy drowns her sorrows in the bottle, the KRKR-TV reporter rubs salt in the wound with a news item about Nancy. Her story is now fodder for the public along with a strong inference her alcoholic hallucinations are responsible for the fantastic tale. A well-aimed bottle thrown at the TV stops the report, but not the hurt and humiliation. Jess and Harry run into the room. Nancy orders Jess to get the car and Harry to accompany her into the desert to find it. Before they leave she orders Jess to get a revolver.Harry drives while Nancy looks for her satellite. They drive for hours and find nothing, ""Just sand and space."" That evening Nancy spots a flash of light. She is convinced it is her satellite, but they still find nothing. Nancy breaks down and apologizes. As they drive off she spots it. She runs up to it. She presses her hands against it, explaining, ""It's real. It's real. I'm not crazy. I did see it."" Harry pulls his wife away as a Giant (Michael Ross, again) reaches out to her. Harry fires the revolver point blank at the creature. As Nancy screams, ""Harry, help me!"" Harry for his part drives off leaving his wife to the giant. Harry arrives at the house, runs past Jess and begins packing his suitcase. Jess demands, ""What have you done with Mrs. Archer?"" Harry ignores him and continues to pack. They scuffle on the stairs and continue their fight in the living room. An empty liquor bottle across his head stops Jess. Harry grabs his suitcase and leaves the house. Jess comes to and calls the sheriff's office. Harry arrives at Honey's hotel room and tells her, ""Get dressed and packed, quick."" Before they can leave her room they are stopped by Deputy Charlie and the night clerk. This time Charlie refuses the customary bribe and takes the pair to see the sheriff.Charlie, Harry and Honey wait at the sheriffs office. The sheriff and a posse were out looking for Mrs. Archer. A phone call informs the three that Mrs. Archer was found on the pool house at the Archer estate. The three drive back to the house. At the house, Cushing and the nurse (Eileen Stevens) finish attending to Nancy and come down the stairs. Dr. Cushing tells Dubbitt she should be moved to a hospital when she's strong enough. Cushing is most concerned about the scratches on her throat. Harry tries to sprint upstairs, but Dr. Cushing warns him that she may be contaminated by radiation. The sheriff asks Harry where he was with Mrs. Archer the night before. Harry lies and tells him he was with Honey all evening. Honey corroborates the lie. The sheriff warns Harry and Honey not to leave town. In the car heading back to town, Honey again suggests a bit of murder to solve their problem. She informs Harry, ""I heard the doctor tell her (the nurse) that an overdose would be fatal."" Harry sarcastically replies, ""Money certainly brings out the best in you, doesn't it?"" Honey presses, ""Have you got the nerve?"" Harry has taken the bait. As the nurse sleeps, Harry fills the syringe and creeps upstairs to their bedroom. As he approaches his sleeping wife in the dark, the nurse catches him red handed when she turns on the light. The nurse screams and calls for the doctor as Harry recoils from the giant hand and arm. ""Doctor Cushing, something's happened to Mrs. Archer,"" the nurse screams again.The next day a delivery is made. Meat hooks, lengths of chain and medical supplies are delivered to the Archer residence. Dr. Cushing consults with Dr. Heinrich Von Loeb (Otto Waldis) but Von Loeb is stumped by the cause of the giantism and the blue-green color around the scratches at her throat. He suspects radiation.At the hotel, Honey amuses herself with her record player. She was expecting Nancy to be dead, and tells Harry so. Harry reports she's still in a coma. The sheriff and deputy search the pool house area. Dubbitt notices a giant footprint in the garden below. Charlie spots a couple more prints. Dubbitt sends Charlie back to the office for weapons. He and Jess follow the footprints in Archer's station wagon out into the desert. They spot the satellite and walk up to explore it. Dubbitt concludes the giant brought Mrs. Archer home and placed her on the pool house roof. Jess finds his gun confirming the Archer couple's presence. Dubbitt and Jess cautiously enter the open satellite and walk past walls made of pegboard and past discharging fire extinguishers. They find a series of glass spheres containing various colored gemstones. They find Mrs. Archer's Star of India diamond. They encounter the giant and retreat out of the space craft. Unable to move the car, they abandon it just before the giant, dressed in a leather Viking tunic, overturns it. The giant is impervious to bullets and grenades. The giant reenters his satellite and departs. Dubbitt and Jess walk back to town.At the Archer house, Cushing and Von Loeb discuss Nancy's case and their own lives. Nancy wakes from her coma and calls for her husband. Harry and Honey are dancing at Tony's Bar and Grill. Charlie informs Harry that there is an emergency at home. Harry is indifferent to the situation and sends Charlie on his way. Back at the house, the sedative is not working. Nancy is awake again and calling for Harry. They try to administer more morphine, but Nancy breaks free. She tears the roof off her room and escapes. The house begins to come apart and Cushing, the nurse, and Von Loeb barely escape. Nancy is single minded now, ""I know where my husband is. He's with that woman. I'll find him."" Nancy strolls casually to town wearing a makeshift bra and skirt made from bed sheets.On his way to the Archer house, Charlie encounters Dubbit and Jess on the road. He stops and picks them up and continues to the Archer home. They pick up Cushing, Von Loeb and the nurse. The six drive back to town. Out in the desert, an old prospector (an uncredited Thomas E. Jackson) spots Mrs. Archer heading for town. Nancy stops and shakes an electrical transmission tower knocking out the power at Tony's place. She then casually strolls up to Tony's, scares a young couple in their car, then heads for the hotel. She tears the sign off the hotel screaming, ""Harry!"" Nancy breaks a window and pushes her giant hand into Honey's bedroom leaving it a shambles. She strolls back to Tony's and calls for her husband. Harry takes Charlie's gun and shoots his wife's giant hand as it comes through the door. Nancy tears the roof off the building. Spotting her quarry Honey Parker, Nancy throws the roof beams and rafters down on the table Honey is hiding under. Honey is dead, and Nancy now directs her wrath at Harry. She picks him up and carries him through the open roof. He complains, ""You're crushing me. I can't breathe."" Dubbitt fires a few shots at Nancy Archer but they have no effect. He finally places a carefully aimed shot at a transformer which explodes, electrocuting Nancy and Harry Archer. Both dead on the ground, Nancy is still clutching Harry in her hand. The doctor ironically remarks, ""She finally got Harry all to herself."" We close with a long-shot of the doctors and townsfolk surrounding the dead bodies of Nancy and Harry Archer.","

Nancy orders Jess to get the car and Harry to accompany her into the desert to find it. Before they leave she orders Jess to get a revolver.Harry drives while Nancy looks for her satellite. They drive for hours and find nothing, ""Just sand and space."" That evening Nancy spots a flash of light. She is convinced it is her satellite, but they still find nothing. Nancy breaks down and apologizes. As they drive off she spots it. She runs up to it. She presses her hands against it, explaining, ""It's real. It's real. I'm not crazy. I did see it."" Harry pulls his wife away as a Giant (Michael Ross, again) reaches out to her. Harry fires the revolver point blank at the creature. As Nancy screams, ""Harry, help me!"" Harry for his part drives off leaving his wife to the giant. Harry arrives at the house, runs past Jess and begins packing his suitcase. Jess demands, ""What have you done with Mrs. Archer?"" Harry ignores him and continues to pack. They scuffle on the stairs and continue their fight in the living room. An empty liquor bottle across his head stops Jess. Harry grabs his suitcase and leaves the house. Jess comes to and calls the sheriff's office. Harry arrives at Honey's hotel room and tells her, ""Get dressed and packed, quick."" Before they can leave her room they are stopped by Deputy Charlie and the night clerk. This time Charlie refuses the customary bribe and takes the pair to see the sheriff.Charlie, Harry and Honey wait at the sheriffs office. The sheriff and a posse were out looking for Mrs. Archer. A phone call informs the three that Mrs. Archer was found on the pool house at the Archer estate. The three drive back to the house. At the house, Cushing and the nurse (Eileen Stevens) finish attending to Nancy and come down the stairs. Dr. Cushing tells Dubbitt she should be moved to a hospital when she's strong enough. Cushing is most concerned about the scratches on her throat. Harry tries to sprint upstairs, but Dr. Cushing warns him that she may be contaminated by radiation. The sheriff asks Harry where he was with Mrs. Archer the night before. Harry lies and tells him he was with Honey all evening. Honey corroborates the lie. The sheriff warns Harry and Honey not to leave town. In the car heading back to town, Honey again suggests a bit of murder to solve their problem. She informs Harry, ""I heard the doctor tell her (the nurse) that an overdose would be fatal."" Harry sarcastically replies, ""Money certainly brings out the best in you, doesn't it?"" Honey presses, ""Have you got the nerve?"" Harry has taken the bait. As the nurse sleeps, Harry fills the syringe and creeps upstairs to their bedroom. As he approaches his sleeping wife in the dark, the nurse catches him red handed when she turns on the light. The nurse screams and calls for the doctor as Harry recoils from the giant hand and arm. ""Doctor Cushing, something's happened to Mrs. Archer,"" the nurse screams again.The next day a delivery is made. Meat hooks, lengths of chain and medical supplies are delivered to the Archer residence. Dr. Cushing consults with Dr. Heinrich Von Loeb (Otto Waldis) but Von Loeb is stumped by the cause of the giantism and the blue-green color around the scratches at her throat. He suspects radiation.At the hotel, Honey amuses herself with her record player. She was expecting Nancy to be dead, and tells Harry so. Harry reports she's still in a coma. The sheriff and deputy search the pool house area. Dubbitt notices a giant footprint in the garden below. Charlie spots a couple more prints. Dubbitt sends Charlie back to the office for weapons. He and Jess follow the footprints in Archer's station wagon out into the desert. They spot the satellite and walk up to explore it. Dubbitt concludes the giant brought Mrs. Archer home and placed her on the pool house roof. Jess finds his gun confirming the Archer couple's presence. Dubbitt and Jess cautiously enter the open satellite and walk past walls made of pegboard and past discharging fire extinguishers. They find a series of glass spheres containing various colored gemstones. They find Mrs. Archer's Star of India diamond. They encounter the giant and retreat out of the space craft. Unable to move the car, they abandon it just before the giant, dressed in a leather Viking tunic, overturns it. The giant is impervious to bullets and grenades. The giant reenters his satellite and departs. Dubbitt and Jess walk back to town.At the Archer house, Cushing and Von Loeb discuss Nancy's case and their own lives. Nancy wakes from her coma and calls for her husband. Harry and Honey are dancing at Tony's Bar and Grill. Charlie informs Harry that there is an emergency at home. Harry is indifferent to the situation and sends Charlie on his way. Back at the house, the sedative is not working. Nancy is awake again and calling for Harry. They try to administer more morphine, but Nancy breaks free. She tears the roof off her room and escapes. The house begins to come apart and Cushing, the nurse, and Von Loeb barely escape. Nancy is single minded now, ""I know where my husband is. He's with that woman. I'll find him."" Nancy strolls casually to town wearing a makeshift bra and skirt made from bed sheets.On his way to the Archer house, Charlie encounters Dubbit and Jess on the road. He stops and picks them up and continues to the Archer home. They pick up Cushing, Von Loeb and the nurse. The six drive back to town. Out in the desert, an old prospector (an uncredited Thomas E. Jackson) spots Mrs. Archer heading for town. Nancy stops and shakes an electrical transmission tower knocking out the power at Tony's place. She then casually strolls up to Tony's, scares a young couple in their car, then heads for the hotel. She tears the sign off the hotel screaming, ""Harry!"" Nancy breaks a window and pushes her giant hand into Honey's bedroom leaving it a shambles. She strolls back to Tony's and calls for her husband. Harry takes Charlie's gun and shoots his wife's giant hand as it comes through the door. Nancy tears the roof off the building. Spotting her quarry Honey Parker, Nancy throws the roof beams and rafters down on the table Honey is hiding under. Honey is dead, and Nancy now directs her wrath at Harry. She picks him up and carries him through the open roof. He complains, ""You're crushing me. I can't breathe."" Dubbitt fires a few shots at Nancy Archer but they have no effect. He finally places a carefully aimed shot at a transformer which explodes, electrocuting Nancy and Harry Archer. Both dead on the ground, Nancy is still clutching Harry in her hand. The doctor ironically remarks, ""She finally got Harry all to herself."" We close with a long-shot of the doctors and townsfolk surrounding the dead bodies of Nancy and Harry Archer.

When youngest son Robert runs off in reaction, he's returned by spoiled brat socialite Cinzia, itching to escape her orchestral conductor father's dictates. Being much a willful child herself, she harmonizes immediately with the kids and, needing a hideout, agrees to be hired on as their nanny. Finding their new house destroyed by a lustful, careless and irresponsible Italian handyman, the five decide to live on the man's neglected and dilapidated houseboat rather than rightfully sue him and take rooms at a hotel.

He accepts her proposal but then, as Cinzia draws men in like a dog in heat, realizes he's more interested in Cinzia.

He's not had much good fortune of late and has gone almost three months without a major catch while others are catching one or even two large marlins every week. Many of the locals make fun of him and some say he's too old now to be fishing but he still loves what he does and is encouraged by a young boy who loves him and has faith in him. On this day he hooks the fish of a lifetime, a marlin that is larger than his skiff. As it slowly pulls him out to sea, the old man reminisces about his past, his successes and the high points of his life. When he does finally manage to land the fish he has to fight off sharks who are feeding on it as he tries to return to his Cuban village.

"30","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051630/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Title and credits roll over a mist covered lake with a tree in the foreground. We open with a woman, Carolyn Hayes (Jana Lund) running towards the camera. She is being chased by a man, Hans Himmler (Mike Lane). She stops, looks back, screams, and then continues running. We only see the man from the waist down as he plods along with a limp. The woman is cornered, now at the same location where the titles and credits were shot. The creature approaches as the woman walks backwards into the lake. The monster grabs the girl, then holds her under water. The director, Douglas Row (Don Red Barry) calls, ""Cut!"" The actor playing the monster does not speak English, so Shuter (Norbert Schiller) must translate. Morgan Haley (John Dennis), the cameraman, confirms that the scene was ok. Doug checks the length of the scene with Judy Stevens (Charlotte Austin). Doug and Judy are divorced and things are still a little frosty in their relationship. He tells her, ""Jealousy, jealousy, lover. Don't blame me because you're no longer an ingénue. Well, I keep you on the payroll, you'll have to admit I'm loyal."" She tartly replies, ""Oh yes, you're loyal to wives number one through four inclusive."" Carolyn is helped from the water. She tells Mike Shaw (Tom Duggan) that this movie scene is to celebrate the 230th anniversary of Frankenstein.Inside the castle, Baron Victor von Frankenstein (Boris Karloff) berates his old friend Wilhelm Gottfried (Rudolph Anders), ""How could you inflict these people upon me Gottfried?"" Gottfried reminds the Baron that he agreed to let the film crew use his castle for the money he needed to purchase a reactor for his experiments. He adds, ""I've been wanting to talk to you about this Victor. You have been spending money and money. You have been buying equipment as though you were a government."" Gottfried has been handling the Baron's finances and has sold most of his art treasures. The discussion turns to the past. The Baron was tortured during the past and is bitter and scarred. He sports a long scar that runs from his left eye to the corner of his mouth. It is apparent that his nose was severely broken. He was forced to perform medical experiments. The Baron is the last of the House of Frankenstein. The film cast and crew return to the castle. Doug Row briefs the Baron on his upcoming performance. Doug is pushy and obnoxious. The Baron is having reservations about involvement in this exploitation of his family history, but he wants that atomic reactor badly and reluctantly cooperates with Row. He has contempt for all but one. He is strangely attracted to Carolyn Hayes and tells her so, ""That could be my pleasure with you as my leading lady, Miss Hayes."" He takes her hand and kisses it. She recoils slightly, repelled by the Baron's clumsy advances. Turning back to the director, the Baron tells him, ""Mr. Row, I'm becoming reconciled to your presence here. Your coming here may be the solution to all my problems."" The Baron laughs maniacally then limps away. He seats himself at an organ and plays a melancholy tune.It is rehearsal day in the basement of the castle. The Baron reads an inscription on the tomb of an ancestor. ""I, Frankenstein, began my work in the year 1740 and with all good intentions and humane thoughts to the high purpose of probing the secrets of life itself - with but one end - the betterment of mankind."" He explains his ancestor's work, as he limps around the basement, and what went wrong. The scene is disrupted when Carolyn screams as the Baron appears ready to stab the corpse on the slab. Hans tells Shuter he is finished and will no longer work at the castle. Row's cash payment convinces Hans to remain. The Baron was off script, as Judy reminds her ex-husband, but Doug loved it anyway.The cast and crew are relaxing in the great room of the castle. Mike is on the phone. Carolyn, Gottfried, and Judy are relaxing and having coffee. The Baron is playing the organ. Judy presents Shuter with a gift, a plaid scarf. She wraps it around his neck, then gives him a friendly kiss on the cheek. The Baron is not amused. He confronts his servant, ""Shuter. You are richly endowed to have one as lovely as Miss Hayes bestow gifts upon you."" Row enters the room with script changes, then exits with Carolyn under the pretext of going over her new scene. Gottfried confronts the Baron with his concerns. It seems that the Baron has been working with the Director of the Morgue. ""Are you interested in corpses?"" He asks the Baron. The Baron makes his friend uneasy with his menacing demeanor. The Baron lights a candle, douses the lights in the Great Room, then descends the stairs to the basement crypt. He twists the head on a statue. A stone crypt lid slides open. The Baron climbs inside and descends the stairs to his secret lab below. A large modern lab is revealed. The walls are covered with electronic equipment and the centerpiece is a nuclear reactor. The Baron listens in on his guests with hidden microphones in their rooms. Studying an old picture of himself, he admires a clay bust - still a work in progress. He opens the reactor door and a gurney of a bandaged figure emerges. The head is just a skull. The Baron dons a lab apron, and washes his hands. Shuter is upstairs securing the castle. The Baron returns to his creature, another work in progress. He removes the bandages on the arm. He records his observations on a reel to reel tape machine. Shuter walks downstairs to the crypt area, securing it for the night. He activates the crypt door by accident. He investigates the open sarcophagus, walks down the hidden stairs, and encounters the Baron. The Baron is sorry to see his old friend and trusted servant has discovered his secret, ""Shuter. Ah, my poor Shuter. Why did it have to be you?"" He becons his servant to approach the body and promises that he will live again. He hypnotizes Shuter. The Baron harvests Shuter's heart for his creation.The next morning Carolyn is fixing breakfast. She notes that Shuter is absent. Judy calls for Shuter, but he is gone. The Baron explains that Shuter is away visiting relatives and may be away for some time. The Baron returns to his lab. He notes that Shuter's brain is now in the skull of his creature. He prepares to install the eyes. He retrieves a pair, in a glass jar, from the lab refrigerator. The closing door bumps his arm and he drops the container. The eyes are destroyed.Sometime later, Gottfried is reviewing some papers in the library as the Baron plays his organ. Carolyn enters and joins the Baron at the organ. He turns to ogle his guest, ""You seem rather disturbed my dear."" She tells the Baron that organ music reminds her of death. The Baron notices Carolyn has Shuter's scarf. She tells him she found it down in the basement. The Baron takes the scarf from Carolyn, places it around his own neck, and then resumes playing his creepy tune. Gottfried enters and asks where Shuter has gone. He notes Shuter has no relatives and a quick search of his room revealed all his clothes are still there. The Baron threatens to tell Gottfried the tale of the inquisitive Commandant of the prison camp. The Baron delights in recounting the tale telling Gottfried that one day his tormentor was found without a tongue. He is gleeful, ""Imagine the irony of it Gottfried. Oh, I know, I was called in to examine the poor wretch. A beautiful piece of surgery, if I do say so myself. Beautiful."" Gottfried seems to get the message and leaves the room.In the lab, the Baron moves his creature back into the reactor and closes the door. He starts the reactor, and steam wafts from the machine. The demand for power causes the lights in the castle to dim. An alarm bill signals the completion of the process. The body is brought out of the reactor. The Baron's intercom allows him to hear Doug's unsuccessful attempt to gain access to Carolyn's locked room. The Baron examines his creation. Judy types in her room, while Mike sleeps fitfully in his. The Baron's creation is now standing, still strapped to the gurney. He attempts to contact the mind of Shuter, now encased in his creation. Finally the EEG shows a reaction. He orders Shuter to raise each arm, the creature follows the instructions. The last order of business is to secure a pair of eyes. Mike visits Judy in her room. He has a bottle and glass. Mike kisses Judy, then pours and downs a glass of liquor. He tries another pass, but gets thrown out of Judy's room. She locks him out and tells him to go to bed. A subsequent knock at the door brings Judy back to scold Mike. When she opens the door the creature is there. She screams and faints. It carries her to the lab, but the Baron chastises his creation. He wanted Row's eyes. Her eyes were unsuitable and the Baron puts them in a disposal device.Doug and Mike argue over Judy's sudden disappearance. Doug is skeptical considering she left without an alimony check. The Baron claims to know nothing about it. Row suggests using the Baron's lab as a setting for the TV show. The Baron asks, ""Gottfried, is the laboratory included in the contract with Mr. Row?"" The answer is no, which prompts the Baron to reply, ""Then you cannot use it."" When pressed, the Baron is adamant -- the answer is NO!Morgan and Carolyn go to the basement crypt to set up shots. Carolyn practices her moves, unaware the creature is behind her in shadow. Carolyn leaves and Morgan remains to line up a few more shots. He looks through his lens and pans around the room. The creature comes into frame and approaches the cinematographer. Back in the lab the Baron examines the eyeballs, but declares them unsuitable due to blood type mismatch. Another pair of eyes are disposed. Inspector Raab (Irwin Berke) takes a missing persons report from Doug Row. The Baron tells the policeman that Judy was married to Mr. Row, so she must have been emotionally disturbed and Morgan went to Frankfurt to get a special lens. Carolyn tells Raab she last saw Morgan in the basement. The Baron volunteers to escort Raab to see for himself. While all are down in the basement looking for Morgan, the Baron sees the sarcophagus lid swing open. He closes it. Finding nothing, Raab apologizes to the Baron for the intrusion.Gottfried comments to the Baron on all the disappearances. The not so subtle reminders to those who question him gone unheeded, the Baron finally agrees to satisfy Gottfried's curiosity. They descend into the crypt. The Baron opens the sarcophagus entrance to his lab. The creature stares at his next victim through opening in the bandages where eyes should be. The Baron kills his old friend and installs the eyes in his creation. He disposes of Gottfried's clothes in the disposal. Doug and Mike examine the crypt area for clues. Doug finds Morgan's view finder. He tells Mike he intends to report this to Inspector Raab. The Baron uses a coin from his collection to hypnotize Mike Shaw. He questions Mike about Row. He directs Mike to get Carolyn at a designated time. Row meets with Raab. He convinces Raab that Judy, Shuter, and Morgan never left the castle. At the designated time Mike fetches Carolyn from her room. Carolyn is confronted by the still bandaged creature. As Raab and Row drive back to the castle, the creature carries Carolyn down to the Baron's lab. She wakes and screams. Carolyn pleads with Shuter to bring her back upstairs. He is conflicted between his affection for Carolyn and the Baron's orders. The Baron fires up his machine. Shuter enters the lab without Carolyn and trashes the place. He walks towards the Baron and is overcome by the atomic steam.The charred remains of the Baron's creation is prone on the floor. A man in a radiation suit takes readings. He allows Raab to enter the lab. Two police officers, Row and Mike also walk in. Raab peels back the bandages on the face of the creature. A younger, unscarred Baron's face is shown. Row plays back the tape and hears, ""I made you in my image so the name of Frankenstein could survive. I gave you eyes, ears, a heart, a brain and."" The voice fades out. We close with a close-up of the creature's head with the face of the Baron.","
    
                    Baron Victor Von Frankenstein has fallen on hard times; he was tortured at the hands of the Nazis for not cooperating with them during World War II and he is now badly disfigured. As his family's wealth begins to run out, the Baron is forced to allow a TV crew shooting a documentary on his monster-making ancestors to film at his castle in Germany. However, the Baron has some ideas of his own: using the money from the crew's rent he buys an atomic reactor and uses it to create a hulking monster, transplanting his butler's brain into the thing and using it to kill off the crew for more spare parts.

The Baron is the last of the House of Frankenstein. The film cast and crew return to the castle. Doug Row briefs the Baron on his upcoming performance. Doug is pushy and obnoxious. The Baron is having reservations about involvement in this exploitation of his family history, but he wants that atomic reactor badly and reluctantly cooperates with Row. He has contempt for all but one. He is strangely attracted to Carolyn Hayes and tells her so, ""That could be my pleasure with you as my leading lady, Miss Hayes."" He takes her hand and kisses it. She recoils slightly, repelled by the Baron's clumsy advances. Turning back to the director, the Baron tells him, ""Mr. Row, I'm becoming reconciled to your presence here. Your coming here may be the solution to all my problems."" The Baron laughs maniacally then limps away. He seats himself at an organ and plays a melancholy tune.It is rehearsal day in the basement of the castle. The Baron reads an inscription on the tomb of an ancestor. ""I, Frankenstein, began my work in the year 1740 and with all good intentions and humane thoughts to the high purpose of probing the secrets of life itself - with but one end - the betterment of mankind."" He explains his ancestor's work, as he limps around the basement, and what went wrong. The scene is disrupted when Carolyn screams as the Baron appears ready to stab the corpse on the slab. Hans tells Shuter he is finished and will no longer work at the castle. Row's cash payment convinces Hans to remain. The Baron was off script, as Judy reminds her ex-husband, but Doug loved it anyway.The cast and crew are relaxing in the great room of the castle. Mike is on the phone. Carolyn, Gottfried, and Judy are relaxing and having coffee. The Baron is playing the organ. Judy presents Shuter with a gift, a plaid scarf. She wraps it around his neck, then gives him a friendly kiss on the cheek. The Baron is not amused. He confronts his servant, ""Shuter. You are richly endowed to have one as lovely as Miss Hayes bestow gifts upon you."" Row enters the room with script changes, then exits with Carolyn under the pretext of going over her new scene. Gottfried confronts the Baron with his concerns. It seems that the Baron has been working with the Director of the Morgue. ""Are you interested in corpses?"" He asks the Baron. The Baron makes his friend uneasy with his menacing demeanor. The Baron lights a candle, douses the lights in the Great Room, then descends the stairs to the basement crypt. He twists the head on a statue. A stone crypt lid slides open. The Baron climbs inside and descends the stairs to his secret lab below. A large modern lab is revealed. The walls are covered with electronic equipment and the centerpiece is a nuclear reactor. The Baron listens in on his guests with hidden microphones in their rooms. Studying an old picture of himself, he admires a clay bust - still a work in progress. He opens the reactor door and a gurney of a bandaged figure emerges. The head is just a skull. The Baron dons a lab apron, and washes his hands. Shuter is upstairs securing the castle. The Baron returns to his creature, another work in progress. He removes the bandages on the arm. He records his observations on a reel to reel tape machine. Shuter walks downstairs to the crypt area, securing it for the night. He activates the crypt door by accident. He investigates the open sarcophagus, walks down the hidden stairs, and encounters the Baron. The Baron is sorry to see his old friend and trusted servant has discovered his secret, ""Shuter. Ah, my poor Shuter. Why did it have to be you?"" He becons his servant to approach the body and promises that he will live again. He hypnotizes Shuter. The Baron harvests Shuter's heart for his creation.The next morning Carolyn is fixing breakfast. She notes that Shuter is absent. Judy calls for Shuter, but he is gone. The Baron explains that Shuter is away visiting relatives and may be away for some time. The Baron returns to his lab. He notes that Shuter's brain is now in the skull of his creature. He prepares to install the eyes. He retrieves a pair, in a glass jar, from the lab refrigerator. The closing door bumps his arm and he drops the container. The eyes are destroyed.Sometime later, Gottfried is reviewing some papers in the library as the Baron plays his organ. Carolyn enters and joins the Baron at the organ. He turns to ogle his guest, ""You seem rather disturbed my dear."" She tells the Baron that organ music reminds her of death. The Baron notices Carolyn has Shuter's scarf. She tells him she found it down in the basement. The Baron takes the scarf from Carolyn, places it around his own neck, and then resumes playing his creepy tune. Gottfried enters and asks where Shuter has gone. He notes Shuter has no relatives and a quick search of his room revealed all his clothes are still there. The Baron threatens to tell Gottfried the tale of the inquisitive Commandant of the prison camp. The Baron delights in recounting the tale telling Gottfried that one day his tormentor was found without a tongue. He is gleeful, ""Imagine the irony of it Gottfried. Oh, I know, I was called in to examine the poor wretch. A beautiful piece of surgery, if I do say so myself. Beautiful."" Gottfried seems to get the message and leaves the room.In the lab, the Baron moves his creature back into the reactor and closes the door. He starts the reactor, and steam wafts from the machine. The demand for power causes the lights in the castle to dim. An alarm bill signals the completion of the process. The body is brought out of the reactor. The Baron's intercom allows him to hear Doug's unsuccessful attempt to gain access to Carolyn's locked room. The Baron examines his creation. Judy types in her room, while Mike sleeps fitfully in his. The Baron's creation is now standing, still strapped to the gurney. He attempts to contact the mind of Shuter, now encased in his creation. Finally the EEG shows a reaction. He orders Shuter to raise each arm, the creature follows the instructions. The last order of business is to secure a pair of eyes. Mike visits Judy in her room. He has a bottle and glass. Mike kisses Judy, then pours and downs a glass of liquor. He tries another pass, but gets thrown out of Judy's room. She locks him out and tells him to go to bed. A subsequent knock at the door brings Judy back to scold Mike. When she opens the door the creature is there. She screams and faints. It carries her to the lab, but the Baron chastises his creation. He wanted Row's eyes. Her eyes were unsuitable and the Baron puts them in a disposal device.Doug and Mike argue over Judy's sudden disappearance. Doug is skeptical considering she left without an alimony check. The Baron claims to know nothing about it. Row suggests using the Baron's lab as a setting for the TV show. The Baron asks, ""Gottfried, is the laboratory included in the contract with Mr. Row?"" The answer is no, which prompts the Baron to reply, ""Then you cannot use it."" When pressed, the Baron is adamant -- the answer is NO!Morgan and Carolyn go to the basement crypt to set up shots. Carolyn practices her moves, unaware the creature is behind her in shadow. Carolyn leaves and Morgan remains to line up a few more shots. He looks through his lens and pans around the room. The creature comes into frame and approaches the cinematographer. Back in the lab the Baron examines the eyeballs, but declares them unsuitable due to blood type mismatch. Another pair of eyes are disposed. Inspector Raab (Irwin Berke) takes a missing persons report from Doug Row. The Baron tells the policeman that Judy was married to Mr. Row, so she must have been emotionally disturbed and Morgan went to Frankfurt to get a special lens. Carolyn tells Raab she last saw Morgan in the basement. The Baron volunteers to escort Raab to see for himself. While all are down in the basement looking for Morgan, the Baron sees the sarcophagus lid swing open. He closes it. Finding nothing, Raab apologizes to the Baron for the intrusion.Gottfried comments to the Baron on all the disappearances. The not so subtle reminders to those who question him gone unheeded, the Baron finally agrees to satisfy Gottfried's curiosity. They descend into the crypt. The Baron opens the sarcophagus entrance to his lab. The creature stares at his next victim through opening in the bandages where eyes should be. The Baron kills his old friend and installs the eyes in his creation. He disposes of Gottfried's clothes in the disposal. Doug and Mike examine the crypt area for clues. Doug finds Morgan's view finder. He tells Mike he intends to report this to Inspector Raab. The Baron uses a coin from his collection to hypnotize Mike Shaw. He questions Mike about Row. He directs Mike to get Carolyn at a designated time. Row meets with Raab. He convinces Raab that Judy, Shuter, and Morgan never left the castle. At the designated time Mike fetches Carolyn from her room. Carolyn is confronted by the still bandaged creature. As Raab and Row drive back to the castle, the creature carries Carolyn down to the Baron's lab. She wakes and screams. Carolyn pleads with Shuter to bring her back upstairs. He is conflicted between his affection for Carolyn and the Baron's orders. The Baron fires up his machine. Shuter enters the lab without Carolyn and trashes the place. He walks towards the Baron and is overcome by the atomic steam.The charred remains of the Baron's creation is prone on the floor. A man in a radiation suit takes readings. He allows Raab to enter the lab. Two police officers, Row and Mike also walk in. Raab peels back the bandages on the face of the creature. A younger, unscarred Baron's face is shown. Row plays back the tape and hears, ""I made you in my image so the name of Frankenstein could survive. I gave you eyes, ears, a heart, a brain and."" The voice fades out. We close with a close-up of the creature's head with the face of the Baron.

A voice belonging to Colonel Edward Carruthers (Marshall Thompson) explains the first ship crashed 6 months ago, and hes the only survivor of the original crew. Because of the strange circumstances of the deaths, he fears his superiors on Earth may have doubts about his story.Back on Earth the press is briefed about the situation with the first Mars mission. The existence of a rescue second ship is revealed and that they have found Carruthers. It is explained that the survivor will be brought back for a court martial.During return preparations an airlock is found left open, we see the shadowy form of a strange creature enter the ship. The crew closes the airlock, unaware of the strange passenger. After successfully lifting off, the pilot Van Heusen (Kim Spalding) challenges Carruthers about the fate of the 9 dead crew members. Carruthers sticks to his story that the others were killed by something on the surface, and thats why they could not find any bodies Van Heusen shows Carruthers a skull recovered; a bullet hole can clearly be seen.The crew are openly hostile to Carruthers, with the exception of Ann Anderson (Shirley Patterson) who shows some kindness. She is not sure Van Heusen is right, despite the evidence of the skull. Carruthers feels he can trust Ann and begins to opens up about exactly what happened. Carruthers was driving the exploration jeep when they encounter a dust storm. Amid the confusion, the crew is picked off the jeep one by one. He and others could hear strange sounds and faint shadows moving through the dust. Carruthers thinks that someone shooting at the shape may have been responsible for the bullet hole in the skull.In another part of the ship Kienholz (Thom Carney) working alone hears a strange noise coming from a storage area. Curious, he investigates. Entering the room he hears a strange animal noise before being attacked and killed by the creature seen earlier. Higher up in the ship Carruthers thinks he hears something and goes to investigate with Eric Royce (Dabbs Greer) Kienholz cant be found and the crew begin an extensive search of the ship, Gino (Richard Hervey) gets left behind when he stops to light a cigarette, he is also attacked.The crew complete the search, as well as not finding Kienholz the realize Gino is also missing. Investigating one of the air vents Carruthers discovers Kienholz's body. Jack Purdue (Robert Bice) thinks Gino might also be in the same crawl space and goes to check. He finds Gino, near death. Before Purdue, can aid him, he in turn is attacked. Escaping, he orders the crew to seal the air vent.Heusen finds some grenades in storage and begin rigging the air vents. If the creature tries to break out it is thought the grenades should kill it. Once the vents are rigged, the crew withdraws to the rec area and begins assembling all the weapons they can find. Gino's brother Bob (Richard Benedict) expresses anger that no further attempt is to made to save Gino.During these discussions the crew begins to wonder if the creature may be intelligent. They are convinced its use of the air vents was not a random action.The creature triggers the explosives, and judging from the howling and enraged sounds the crew suspect it has been injured but not killed.Waiting for a while the crew investigate they find huge amounts of damage but understand they have now isolated the creature on that deck. Seeing an opportunity they corner the creature and open fire with guns. It is unaffected and the creature counter attacks driving the crew back to the rec room.Mary Royce remembers Gino making gas grenades in case dinosaurs where encountered on Mars. Mounting another attack the crew uses the grenades to retake the lower deck. Once more they are driven off by the creature. Mary Royce does an autopsy on Kienholz's body. She reports that every drop of moisture is gone. Even the bone marrow is powdery, and his glands are completely gone. This knowledge does not help Van Heusen who was injured in the last battle and has come down with a fever she cant controlStrange banging noises are heard coming from the deck controlled by the creature. Checking through a hatch door they discover the creature is exploring the ship, looking for weaknesses. As they consider their options, it is realized they can get around the creature by going outside the ship and re-entering a deck lower than the creature.Carruthers and Calder make the dangerous trip and re-enter the ship. Realizing they have the advantage they decide to rig a trap that will electrocute the creature. With the task completed they lure the beast into the trap, unfortunately the plan fails. Carrruthers escapes back through an airlock but Calder has broken his leg and is trapped in a corner with nothing more than a welders torch.The crew establishes contact with Calder, and he explains how he's been able to stop the creature. The gas bottle he is using only has a 3 hour supply. To add to their problems, Ann advises that without fresh blood supplies Van Huesen will dieFinelli and Purdue undertake the mission with Carruthers. Calder lets them know the creature is doing something in the reactor room down to the lower deck to get the blood. Calder lets them know the creature has entered the reactor room. They automatically close the only door and hope once again the creature is trapped.Huesen now delirious activates the controls that open the reactor shields in the hope of killing the creature. He considers the death of the four men a fair bargain to destroy the creature. The creature however senses something is wrong and breaks out of the reactor room before the shield is deployed. Finelli is caught off guard and killed. The other two men escape into the control room.The creature goes on a ramgage and begins randomly destroying things. Playing a hunch Carruthers tells Cadwell to crawl to the airlock. He then tells the others to get into spacesuits. The way to destroy the creature is to vent the atmosphere from the ship.The creature makes one last ditch effort to break into the area controlled by the crew. It finally succeeds just as Carruthers triggers the venting process. The crew brace themselves as the air threatens to drag them out in the venting process. The creature trapped by the same airflow fights to save itself till finally with the air gone, it dies","

    Synopsis
    
Opening scenePanorama of the Mars in the distance we can see a wrecked spacecraft, close by another functional ship. A voice belonging to Colonel Edward Carruthers (Marshall Thompson) explains the first ship crashed 6 months ago, and hes the only survivor of the original crew. Because of the strange circumstances of the deaths, he fears his superiors on Earth may have doubts about his story.Back on Earth the press is briefed about the situation with the first Mars mission. The existence of a rescue second ship is revealed and that they have found Carruthers. It is explained that the survivor will be brought back for a court martial.During return preparations an airlock is found left open, we see the shadowy form of a strange creature enter the ship. The crew closes the airlock, unaware of the strange passenger. After successfully lifting off, the pilot Van Heusen (Kim Spalding) challenges Carruthers about the fate of the 9 dead crew members. Carruthers sticks to his story that the others were killed by something on the surface, and thats why they could not find any bodies Van Heusen shows Carruthers a skull recovered; a bullet hole can clearly be seen.The crew are openly hostile to Carruthers, with the exception of Ann Anderson (Shirley Patterson) who shows some kindness. She is not sure Van Heusen is right, despite the evidence of the skull. Carruthers feels he can trust Ann and begins to opens up about exactly what happened. Carruthers was driving the exploration jeep when they encounter a dust storm. Amid the confusion, the crew is picked off the jeep one by one. He and others could hear strange sounds and faint shadows moving through the dust. Carruthers thinks that someone shooting at the shape may have been responsible for the bullet hole in the skull.In another part of the ship Kienholz (Thom Carney) working alone hears a strange noise coming from a storage area. Curious, he investigates. Entering the room he hears a strange animal noise before being attacked and killed by the creature seen earlier. Higher up in the ship Carruthers thinks he hears something and goes to investigate with Eric Royce (Dabbs Greer) Kienholz cant be found and the crew begin an extensive search of the ship, Gino (Richard Hervey) gets left behind when he stops to light a cigarette, he is also attacked.The crew complete the search, as well as not finding Kienholz the realize Gino is also missing. Investigating one of the air vents Carruthers discovers Kienholz's body. Jack Purdue (Robert Bice) thinks Gino might also be in the same crawl space and goes to check. He finds Gino, near death. Before Purdue, can aid him, he in turn is attacked. Escaping, he orders the crew to seal the air vent.Heusen finds some grenades in storage and begin rigging the air vents. If the creature tries to break out it is thought the grenades should kill it. Once the vents are rigged, the crew withdraws to the rec area and begins assembling all the weapons they can find. Gino's brother Bob (Richard Benedict) expresses anger that no further attempt is to made to save Gino.During these discussions the crew begins to wonder if the creature may be intelligent. They are convinced its use of the air vents was not a random action.The creature triggers the explosives, and judging from the howling and enraged sounds the crew suspect it has been injured but not killed.Waiting for a while the crew investigate they find huge amounts of damage but understand they have now isolated the creature on that deck. Seeing an opportunity they corner the creature and open fire with guns. It is unaffected and the creature counter attacks driving the crew back to the rec room.Mary Royce remembers Gino making gas grenades in case dinosaurs where encountered on Mars. Mounting another attack the crew uses the grenades to retake the lower deck. Once more they are driven off by the creature. Mary Royce does an autopsy on Kienholz's body. She reports that every drop of moisture is gone. Even the bone marrow is powdery, and his glands are completely gone. This knowledge does not help Van Heusen who was injured in the last battle and has come down with a fever she cant controlStrange banging noises are heard coming from the deck controlled by the creature. Checking through a hatch door they discover the creature is exploring the ship, looking for weaknesses. As they consider their options, it is realized they can get around the creature by going outside the ship and re-entering a deck lower than the creature.Carruthers and Calder make the dangerous trip and re-enter the ship. Realizing they have the advantage they decide to rig a trap that will electrocute the creature. With the task completed they lure the beast into the trap, unfortunately the plan fails. Carrruthers escapes back through an airlock but Calder has broken his leg and is trapped in a corner with nothing more than a welders torch.The crew establishes contact with Calder, and he explains how he's been able to stop the creature. The gas bottle he is using only has a 3 hour supply. To add to their problems, Ann advises that without fresh blood supplies Van Huesen will dieFinelli and Purdue undertake the mission with Carruthers. Calder lets them know the creature is doing something in the reactor room down to the lower deck to get the blood. Calder lets them know the creature has entered the reactor room. They automatically close the only door and hope once again the creature is trapped.Huesen now delirious activates the controls that open the reactor shields in the hope of killing the creature. He considers the death of the four men a fair bargain to destroy the creature. The creature however senses something is wrong and breaks out of the reactor room before the shield is deployed. Finelli is caught off guard and killed. The other two men escape into the control room.The creature goes on a ramgage and begins randomly destroying things. Playing a hunch Carruthers tells Cadwell to crawl to the airlock. He then tells the others to get into spacesuits. The way to destroy the creature is to vent the atmosphere from the ship.The creature makes one last ditch effort to break into the area controlled by the crew. It finally succeeds just as Carruthers triggers the venting process. The crew brace themselves as the air threatens to drag them out in the venting process. The creature trapped by the same airflow fights to save itself till finally with the air gone, it dies

                    WWII. Focuses on the military and personal lives of three men for the duration of the war. The first is Lieutenant Christian Diestl of the German SS. A self-professed non-political person, he, prior to the war, nonetheless believed that Hitler and the Nazis would be good for Germany by bringing a new prosperity to working class people like him, and that the few casualties of war are a necessary means to the desired end. The second and third are US Army Privates Michael Whiteacre and Noah Ackerman, who meet and befriend each other at the draft board office. Michael is a famous Broadway entertainer, who admits not wanting to see any action and who uses whatever means available because of his celebrity to get a non-combat posting away from the battlefields. Jewish Noah, slight of build, is a sensitive man and all alone in the world before meeting Michael, these items in combination which make him a seemingly easy target for those who are against him in any way. On the personal side, Christian, while posted in France, and a Frenchwoman named Françoise fall in love despite she despising he being one of the Nazi aggressors. He also embarks on a sexual tryst with Gretchen Hardenberg, the wife of his commanding officer, the marriage a cold one which has made both husband and wife cold people. Noah marries the former Hope Plowman, a gentile, just prior to being shipped overseas. Their marriage was one, solely on the surface, that was met with disapproval by her provincial father, who had never met a Jew before Noah. And Michael's girlfriend, socialite Margaret Freemantle, who is working in the USO, wanted to get married before his deployment like Noah and Hope did. Although Margaret doesn't want to see Michael get hurt, she also wants him to take responsibility for doing his meaningful part for the American war effort, especially as she had seen and despised Naziism when she was in Bavaria on vacation prior to the war. The war itself changes Christian, Noah and Michael in different ways, the former two whose biggest literal and figurative battles may be with forces on their supposed sides.

Only a handful of mostly resident guests are currently staying at the hotel. They include: retired and decorated Major Angus Pollock; elderly Maud Railton-Bell, who needs to control everything, especially her timid and mousy spinster daughter, Sibyl Railton-Bell, who has a quiet bond with and crush on the Major; Lady Gladys Matheson, who follows whatever Mrs. Railton-Bell wants purely out of camaraderie; straightforward and slightly gruff Miss Meacham; staid schoolteacher Mr. Fowler; students Charles and Jean, a young unmarried couple who are the primary focus of Mrs. Railton-Bell's ire for probably doing it out of wedlock; and writer John Malcolm, a brash American who hides his issues behind his excessive drinking and who is in a secret liaison with Pat, to who he wants to get married. John and Pat's relationship is threatened with the unexpected arrival to the hotel of Ann Shankland, she and John who have a turbulent but passionate history. Ann's arrival is not by accident, she who says she wants to help John before she gets remarried, but who may have other more self-motivated reasons for coming to see John.

As Mrs. Railton-Bell tries to control the situation with the Major to her satisfaction, which includes bending the truth to suit her own needs, the others out of their own situations, especially Sibyl, may eventually come to their own conclusions on how best to deal with the Major's issue with respect to his stay at the hotel.

A sentry (Sheldon Allan) stops to light a cigarette on his rounds when he hears strange noises coming from the woods. Hearing a scream coming from the woods the sentry runs to investigate. He finds the body of a man his face hideously distortedSometime later base security officer Al Chester (Terry Kilburn) and his Commander Major Jeff Cummings (Marshall Thompson) discuss the death. The FBIs report on the dead man indicates no criminal record of suspect connections. Chester suggests handing over the incident to the local authorities for investigations.They then check in with Dr Warren (Gil Winfield) who intended to do an autopsy on the man. Dr Warren reports Mayor Hawkins (James Dyrenforth) and Dr Bradley (Peter Madden) from the local county coroners department claimed the body before he could examine it.Col Butler (Stanley Maxted) calls Cummings to a meeting with Mayor Hawkins and the dead mans Sister Barbara Griselle (Kim Parker) Griselle and Hawkins point blank refuse to allow the military to conduct the autopsy. Butler then shows Barbara her brothers diary found where he was killed. Butler demands to know why her brother was keeping meticulous records of flight operations around the base. Griselle is furious at the invasion of privacy and Butlers very selective reading of the diary. She shows him pages of notes in the diary where her brother was tracking milk production of his herd and trying to correlate the falling production with the increasing aircraft activity.Later Cummings drives Barbara home; he apologizes for Butlers and explains the General had no real malice towards her brother, rather he was just doing his job. She takes the apology on face value and seems engaged by Cummings warm tones of reconciliationAn unknown time later, Cummings is supervising an experimental radar test at the base. It is hoped they can increase the range of current technology and begin directly monitor Soviet air activity in Siberia. The key to success is the amount of power they can run through the system. For this a small atomic reactor was built at the base.The test progresses normally and Cummings begins calling for more power to be delivered. His engineer warns they are in danger of overloading the reactor. Initially the technology begins to show promise before a sudden power drain kicks in. Butler is frustrated by the result. They know they are producing enough power, but beyond a certain point they are not delivering that power to the systemNearby at a farm owned by the Adams, Amelia Adam (Lala Lloyd) hears a strange noise in the barn. She goes to investigate and catches sight of something moving through the hay stored in the barn. Before she can react she is attacked and killed.Her husband, Ben (Meadows White) hears the commotion and runs to her aid. He in turn is attacked and defends himself briefly with a pitchfork against the unseen attacker before also being killedAt the funeral of Barbaras brother, people begin to hear about the double fatalities. Mayor Hawkins immediately blames the airbase and calls Butler with a series of accusations. Capt Chester tries to investigate but is ordered away from the crime scene by a local police officer,Howard Gibbons (Robert MacKenzie)Finally a joint autopsy is arranged, both Doctor Bradley and Warren have no trouble agreeing on their findings. All the victims have two small holes at the base of the skull. Further investigation shows that the entire brain along with the spinal cord is missing.Butler vows to get to the bottom of the mystery. He contacts the top medical and scientific experts in the Pentagon and instructs Cummings to get out among the villagers and see what they know.Cummings begins with Barbara. She works for Professor Walgate (Kynaston Reeves) transcribing his notes for scientific papers. Cummings is aware of Walgate and his extended interest in paranormal activity. Cumming senses a mutual attraction from Barbara, and begins to act on the emotion. Howard Gibbons interrupts the moment and an altercation occurs with Gibbons accusing Cummings of tom catting. Helen breaks up the fight and orders Cummings from the house.Cummings thinks he might have something and gets Chester to locate everything Walgate has published to see if any of his previous work can be connected with the deaths.Later that night Mayor Hawkins retires to bed when something invisible begins entering the house. Roused by the strange sounds Hawkins investigates and is killed instantly by an apparently invisible entity.News of Hawkins death set the town on edge. Constable Gibbons tries to calm the situation by arranging for a posse to go into the woods. Gibbons is convinced some sort of maniac is hiding in the woods. This seems to have the desired effect of getting the towns energy directed to something positive.Further background information about Walgate comes through from the FBI. He is considered eccentric but definitely a genius. Armed with this new information Cummings visits Walgate, he explains to the scientist the problems the deaths are causing. Walgate has worked out the reason for the base and the need for its own nuclear reactor. Although he gets every detail correct, Cummings admits to nothing.Walgate then focuses of the deaths and seems to take an unhealthy interest in the facial expressions of the dead. The professor suddenly turns very aggressive to Cummings. Barbara breaks up the conversation blaming Cummings dismissively and throws him out yet again.The posse Gibbons organized continues their sweep of the forest well into the night. Close to dawn, two of the men well away from the main group hear something odd in the trees. They go to investigate and get separated. One of the men becomes spooked and retreats shouting assistance.At daybreak the search parties return to the town without finding Howard Gibbons. A council meeting is called. Cummings is invited to the meeting to explain the Air Force position. He begins by reinforcing there no radiation involved and records and confirmed there are no missing military personnel to explain the deathsThe meeting is broken up when Gibbons stumbles into the meeting. He seems to be severely mentally retarded an incapable of normal speech. After the meeting Cummings confides to Barbara he thinks Walgate is behind the problems. For no apparent reason he tells Barbara he is going to investigate the cemeteryIn one of the vaults he finds a passage leading deep underground. He finds the newly interned body of the Mayor and Walgates favorite pipe. Suddenly from above he hears the vault door close, and realizes hes trapped. Finding two candles and begins to explore the vault in hope of finding another exit.At the base Capt Chester cant find Cummings. Calling Barbara he finds out that Cummings is probably at the cemetery. Chester stops to collect Barbara so they can continue on to the cemetery. Once there they hear strane thumping noises and realize Cummings trapped in one of the vaultsCumming then confronts Walgate over what has been occurring. He is convinced Walgate has developed some form of mind control. Walgate refuses to answer till Cummings shows him the pipe he retrieved from the vault. Walgate finally seen Cummings and intentionally locked him in the vaultWalgate explains he was examining the Mayor to determine the cause of death. Walgate seems to have a stroke and mutters something about shutting down the power plant before passing out. Cummings goes to Butler and after arguing Butler agrees to shut downAt the power plant the process for shut down commences and the technicians realize all the rods controlling the pile have been smashed. Butler immediately organizes emergency replacements. A call comes through; Walgate has regained consciousness and wants to speak to the base commander in person.Walgate explains his theory of thought amplification, he realized telepathy was not the answer and he needed to find a way to produce an entity powered by will power. He had been using electrical energy to power the process, after many failed experiments; he is in the middle of trying again when the house is hit by lighting. The extra power allowed him to turn the page of a book using only thoughtHe now understood that power was the key to the process, and began designing more powerful tests. His work progresses to a point where even a bigger power source was needed. When the airbase was constructed he worked out how to draw on the energy from the atomic powerEventually he created a life form based entirely on thought and hence invisible. One night, he discovers his lab in a shambles. Instinctively he knew his new creature had escaped. Instead of creating something to benefit man, hed created a fiend. He also believed there was more than one. When the first of the deaths occurred he decided that it was his fiends behind it. One of Butlers men sees a commotion outside and investigates. Butler tries to call the base but discovers the line has been cut. The solider outside screams and is instantly dead. Butler understands the danger and orders the others to begins to barricades themselves in the room.Walgate is asked how they can be rendered visible; he surmises that with enough power from the pile it could be done. Back at the installation one of the technicians becomes concerned at the fluctuations he is seeing in the power levels, as be checks instruments he is killed by one of the creatures.Now with unlimited power available, one of the creatures attains visibility. It is nothing more than a brain attached to a spinal cord and a number of tentacles protruding from the brain stem. It moves using a clumsy worm like motion.Back at the house another creature begins to attack, Melville (Launce Maraschal) becomes panicked at the enclosed situation. Looking outside, Butler sees all the creatures are now visible and at least three are attacking the house.They study the creatures for a short while then Cummings decides to try shooting the creatures. He kills one easily and while they concentrate on killing the others, one of the creatures drops down through the chimney and kills Melville.Cummings realizes they need to shut the power down. He volunteers to go because he knows the layout of the control room. Walgate also goes out to try and distract the creatures and improve Cummings chances. The creatures fall for Walgates decoy and Cummings escapes to safety. Cumming reaches the plant and breaks in as one of the creatures attacks him. Working his way to the control room he discovers a large number of base personal dead.Those still at the house realize the end may come soon.

Jimmy Wallace (Jack Nicholson) is in an alley and gets into a fight with Manny Cole (Brett Halsey) over a woman. Three more join the fight and hold Jimmy while Manny beats him unconscious.At the Klix restaurant a carhop, Julie (Lynn Cartwright) brings a policeman more coffee. Manny and his friend Joey Clayman (Ralph Reed) enter the restaurant. In the alley, Jimmy is coming to. He is helped to his feet by a friend and football player, Fred Davis (uncredited). Manny is at a table with Joey and Carole Fields (Carolyn Mitchell). Pete Gambelli (Frank Richards) is the owner of the place and approaches their table and inquires if everything is ok. Evelyn (Mitzi McCall), Manny's last girlfriend, approaches the table. She says hello to Manny and invites herself to sit down. Manny immediately tells her, ""Get Lost."" It is Joey who wryly observes, ""They dont know when Manny's through with them."" Carole expresses concern over Jimmy's beating. Manny tells Carole she's now his girl and pours an ample supply of alcohol into her soft drink. She reluctantly drinks the spiked cola. Al Werner (James Fillmore) and Gad (uncredited) join Joey, Manny and Carole at their table. Gad is considered another Jimmy Wallace, so he is rudely dismissed from the table. Manny gives Joey money and orders his flunky to procure two more bottles of alcohol.Joey exits the restaurant to annoy Julie and Police Officer Glen Gannon (John Shay). Jimmy and Fred arrive at the Klix. Fred tells Jimmy that Carole isn't any good. He convinces Jimmy to use the phone to talk to Carole. Evelyn answers the phone. She gets Carole, but phrases it so Manny thinks it might be another boyfriend calling her. Carole tells Jimmy not to call her anymore. A very jealous Manny hustles her back to the table. Jimmy and Fred enter the restaurant. Jimmy announces that he is taking Carole home. As things escalate, Pete comes over to intervene. He tells Manny and Jimmy to take it outside. The five men: Manny, Jimmy, Joey, Al and Fred step outside. A man, his wife and baby pull into the parking lot in their car. The five men continue walking. A scuffle breaks out and Jimmy manages to grab the gun from Al, who was holding the gun for Manny. Two gunshots ring out. Office Gannon quickly exits his police car and confronts Jimmy. Mrs. Maxton (Barbara Knudson) leaves the bathroom carrying her infant. Sam (Smoki Whitfield) leaves the storeroom and leads Mrs. Maxton back to the storeroom. Jimmy runs back and enters the storeroom. He closes and locks the door. Mr. Carl Maxton (William A. Forester) pleads with Gannon to help his wife and baby. Jimmy turns around, and to his shock and dismay, sees he is not alone in the storeroom.Pete Gambelli is annoyed, and tells Lt. Porter (Harry Lauter), that the police closed up his business. Porter asks Sgt. Reed (John Weed) about the two boys who were shot. He is told that they were alive when the ambulance left. Porter talks to Fred Davis and comments about the brass knuckles used on his face. Porter talks to officer Gannon. Gannon tells Porter that things are quiet and Jimmy isn't talking. Porter calls to Jimmy over the loud speaker. He demands Jimmy surrender. Gannon takes the microphone and continues to demand Jimmy surrender. Sam tells Jimmy, ""The man's right, boy. You're in bad enough trouble as it is."" He pleads with Jimmy to let the lady and baby go. The baby begins to get restless and Mrs. Maxton asks to leave. The baby begins to cry.In the restaurant, Porter calls for the Fields girl, Carole. Evelyn informs the Lieutenant that she ran out. The police begin to question the patrons. A truck pulls up outside. Joey taunts Evelyn about her loyalty to Manny. Joey sarcastically states, ""Patsies. The world's full of 'em."" The KQQQ news van stops in the parking lot. Joe the driver (an uncredited Roger Corman) and reporter, Rick Connor (Ed Nelson) get out and set up for a live broadcast. Sgt. Reed greets Connor and warns him of the danger. Fred tells Porter it started over girls. He relays the story of finding Jimmy in the alley and Jimmy's desire to get Carole away from Manny. Joey is next for questioning. He is a smartass and his attitude is not appreciated by Porter. The Lieutenant lifts him off his feet and frisks the little punk. He finds the brass knuckles. Joey does a surprising amount of talking. He volunteers that the gun used in the crime was in Al's possession, but belongs to Manny. He also admits Manny was trying to get Carole drunk, as her parents are out of town for the evening. Joey is a font of information and sings like a canary. He also lets slip that Gambelli looks the other way when alcohol is secreted into his establishment. Porter orders Joey to be arrested on a concealed weapons charge. Sgt. Reed informs Porter that the television news crew has arrived and there is still no word from Jimmy.Connor begins to record some of his dialog for the evening news. It has now been two hours since Jimmy took three hostages. Connor directs the camera over to the anxious Carl Maxton. Connor interviews Porter. A policeman arrives with Carole Fields. A car drives up with Jimmy's parents. Maxton confronts the anxious Wallace couple. Mr. Wallace (Bill Erwin) doesn't say much, but his wife Helen Wallace (an uncredited Ruth Swanson) speaks her mind. She tells Maxton that Carole is ""selfish, vulgar and cruel."" She directs her anger to the girl standing within earshot and adds, ""She's rotten!""Julie brings Officer Glen Gannon a sandwich. Julie tells Gannon she has kids of her own and that her husband was killed in a car accident. Amid all the commotion, a man approaches with a rifle. Cannon orders Julie back inside. The man stands on a box near a window of the storeroom where Jimmy is holding his hostages. Gannon disarms the man and shots are fired. The rifleman is identified as Mr. Werner (an uncredited Claude Stroud) the father of Al Werner, one of the boys shot. Mr. Werner tried to take the law into his own hands, and was arrested and taken away. Porter asks Mrs. Wallace to talk to her son. Carole seeks a little sympathy from Julie, but Julie tells her, ""Don't you know what you've done? That boy might be killed any minute. You think because you're 16 the world owes you something. Well it doesn't. You'll end up in the gutter.""A man in the crowd (screenplay writer Leo Gordon) tells a woman the fire department will be down soon. If the crowd gets out of hand, they hose them down. Mrs. Wallace pleads with Jimmy to give himself up. Carole runs out of the restaurant and pleads with Mrs. Wallace to let her talk to Jimmy. She is sent back into the restaurant. Jimmy goes to the window to talk to his mother. The crowd goes wild and Jimmy fires three shots at them and then ducks back down. The baby is still crying and Mrs. Maxton is at her wits end. She blurts out, ""I hope they kill you. You're worse than an animal.""Three hours have elapsed since the hostage situation began. Jimmy's nerves are raw and the baby crying only makes things worse, ""Keep him quiet, can't you?"" Mrs. Maxton explains the baby is hungry. Jimmy orders Sam to go to the window and order a bottle of milk for the infant. Sam wisely waves a white flag so he doesn't get shot by mistake. Sam asks for a bottle of milk for the baby. A bottle is prepared. A thermos of coffee is spiked by Porter with a sedative and added to the basket. Mrs. Maxton makes a break for the door, but the baby's cries defeat her plans. Jimmy begs her not to try that again. Sam and Mrs. Maxton take turns holding and comforting the baby.Sgt. Reed warns Connor to move his news van.

    Synopsis
    The first motion picture starring Jack Nicholson starts with title and credits shown over a section of brick wall. Jimmy Wallace (Jack Nicholson) is in an alley and gets into a fight with Manny Cole (Brett Halsey) over a woman. Three more join the fight and hold Jimmy while Manny beats him unconscious.At the Klix restaurant a carhop, Julie (Lynn Cartwright) brings a policeman more coffee. Manny and his friend Joey Clayman (Ralph Reed) enter the restaurant. In the alley, Jimmy is coming to. He is helped to his feet by a friend and football player, Fred Davis (uncredited). Manny is at a table with Joey and Carole Fields (Carolyn Mitchell). Pete Gambelli (Frank Richards) is the owner of the place and approaches their table and inquires if everything is ok. Evelyn (Mitzi McCall), Manny's last girlfriend, approaches the table. She says hello to Manny and invites herself to sit down. Manny immediately tells her, ""Get Lost."" It is Joey who wryly observes, ""They dont know when Manny's through with them."" Carole expresses concern over Jimmy's beating. Manny tells Carole she's now his girl and pours an ample supply of alcohol into her soft drink. She reluctantly drinks the spiked cola. Al Werner (James Fillmore) and Gad (uncredited) join Joey, Manny and Carole at their table. Gad is considered another Jimmy Wallace, so he is rudely dismissed from the table. Manny gives Joey money and orders his flunky to procure two more bottles of alcohol.Joey exits the restaurant to annoy Julie and Police Officer Glen Gannon (John Shay). Jimmy and Fred arrive at the Klix. Fred tells Jimmy that Carole isn't any good. He convinces Jimmy to use the phone to talk to Carole. Evelyn answers the phone. She gets Carole, but phrases it so Manny thinks it might be another boyfriend calling her. Carole tells Jimmy not to call her anymore. A very jealous Manny hustles her back to the table. Jimmy and Fred enter the restaurant. Jimmy announces that he is taking Carole home. As things escalate, Pete comes over to intervene. He tells Manny and Jimmy to take it outside. The five men: Manny, Jimmy, Joey, Al and Fred step outside. A man, his wife and baby pull into the parking lot in their car. The five men continue walking. A scuffle breaks out and Jimmy manages to grab the gun from Al, who was holding the gun for Manny. Two gunshots ring out. Office Gannon quickly exits his police car and confronts Jimmy. Mrs. Maxton (Barbara Knudson) leaves the bathroom carrying her infant. Sam (Smoki Whitfield) leaves the storeroom and leads Mrs. Maxton back to the storeroom. Jimmy runs back and enters the storeroom. He closes and locks the door. Mr. Carl Maxton (William A. Forester) pleads with Gannon to help his wife and baby. Jimmy turns around, and to his shock and dismay, sees he is not alone in the storeroom.Pete Gambelli is annoyed, and tells Lt. Porter (Harry Lauter), that the police closed up his business. Porter asks Sgt. Reed (John Weed) about the two boys who were shot. He is told that they were alive when the ambulance left. Porter talks to Fred Davis and comments about the brass knuckles used on his face. Porter talks to officer Gannon. Gannon tells Porter that things are quiet and Jimmy isn't talking. Porter calls to Jimmy over the loud speaker. He demands Jimmy surrender. Gannon takes the microphone and continues to demand Jimmy surrender. Sam tells Jimmy, ""The man's right, boy. You're in bad enough trouble as it is."" He pleads with Jimmy to let the lady and baby go. The baby begins to get restless and Mrs. Maxton asks to leave. The baby begins to cry.In the restaurant, Porter calls for the Fields girl, Carole. Evelyn informs the Lieutenant that she ran out. The police begin to question the patrons. A truck pulls up outside. Joey taunts Evelyn about her loyalty to Manny. Joey sarcastically states, ""Patsies. The world's full of 'em."" The KQQQ news van stops in the parking lot. Joe the driver (an uncredited Roger Corman) and reporter, Rick Connor (Ed Nelson) get out and set up for a live broadcast. Sgt. Reed greets Connor and warns him of the danger. Fred tells Porter it started over girls. He relays the story of finding Jimmy in the alley and Jimmy's desire to get Carole away from Manny. Joey is next for questioning. He is a smartass and his attitude is not appreciated by Porter. The Lieutenant lifts him off his feet and frisks the little punk. He finds the brass knuckles. Joey does a surprising amount of talking. He volunteers that the gun used in the crime was in Al's possession, but belongs to Manny. He also admits Manny was trying to get Carole drunk, as her parents are out of town for the evening. Joey is a font of information and sings like a canary. He also lets slip that Gambelli looks the other way when alcohol is secreted into his establishment. Porter orders Joey to be arrested on a concealed weapons charge. Sgt. Reed informs Porter that the television news crew has arrived and there is still no word from Jimmy.Connor begins to record some of his dialog for the evening news. It has now been two hours since Jimmy took three hostages. Connor directs the camera over to the anxious Carl Maxton. Connor interviews Porter. A policeman arrives with Carole Fields. A car drives up with Jimmy's parents. Maxton confronts the anxious Wallace couple. Mr. Wallace (Bill Erwin) doesn't say much, but his wife Helen Wallace (an uncredited Ruth Swanson) speaks her mind. She tells Maxton that Carole is ""selfish, vulgar and cruel."" She directs her anger to the girl standing within earshot and adds, ""She's rotten!""Julie brings Officer Glen Gannon a sandwich. Julie tells Gannon she has kids of her own and that her husband was killed in a car accident. Amid all the commotion, a man approaches with a rifle. Cannon orders Julie back inside. The man stands on a box near a window of the storeroom where Jimmy is holding his hostages. Gannon disarms the man and shots are fired. The rifleman is identified as Mr. Werner (an uncredited Claude Stroud) the father of Al Werner, one of the boys shot. Mr. Werner tried to take the law into his own hands, and was arrested and taken away. Porter asks Mrs. Wallace to talk to her son. Carole seeks a little sympathy from Julie, but Julie tells her, ""Don't you know what you've done? That boy might be killed any minute. You think because you're 16 the world owes you something. Well it doesn't. You'll end up in the gutter.""A man in the crowd (screenplay writer Leo Gordon) tells a woman the fire department will be down soon. If the crowd gets out of hand, they hose them down. Mrs. Wallace pleads with Jimmy to give himself up. Carole runs out of the restaurant and pleads with Mrs. Wallace to let her talk to Jimmy. She is sent back into the restaurant. Jimmy goes to the window to talk to his mother. The crowd goes wild and Jimmy fires three shots at them and then ducks back down. The baby is still crying and Mrs. Maxton is at her wits end. She blurts out, ""I hope they kill you. You're worse than an animal.""Three hours have elapsed since the hostage situation began. Jimmy's nerves are raw and the baby crying only makes things worse, ""Keep him quiet, can't you?"" Mrs. Maxton explains the baby is hungry. Jimmy orders Sam to go to the window and order a bottle of milk for the infant. Sam wisely waves a white flag so he doesn't get shot by mistake. Sam asks for a bottle of milk for the baby. A bottle is prepared. A thermos of coffee is spiked by Porter with a sedative and added to the basket. Mrs. Maxton makes a break for the door, but the baby's cries defeat her plans. Jimmy begs her not to try that again. Sam and Mrs. Maxton take turns holding and comforting the baby.Sgt. Reed warns Connor to move his news van. He tells the reporter that they plan to blast the kid out, but Gambelli voices his objections to his place being damaged. A hot dog vendor arrives and begins peddling his wares. This only adds to the carnival-like atmosphere. Gambelli's lawyer, John Lawson (an uncredited Herb Vigran) arrives by car. Porter starts by insulting the lawyer.

                    A poor farmer is obsessed with finding gold on his land supposedly buried by his grandfather. To find it he conveniently moves a marker out of his way that designates the land on which it rests as as God's Little Acre, where anything that comes from the ground will go to God's work. Eventually he abducts an albino to help him find the gold. Meanwhile, his daughter-in-law is suspected of fooling around with a labor activist out of work since the mill closed, and a local political hopeful actively seeks his daughter's hand in marriage.

                    Cotton farmer Ty Ty Walden is convinced that his grandfather buried a cache of gold on the family farm. As such, ever since grandpa died fifteen years earlier, Ty Ty, now with two of his grown sons Buck and Shaw, has been manually digging holes on the farm looking for the gold. Ty Ty is doing this all in the name of God, to whom he looks and in turn provides. His friend, aspiring sheriff Pluto Swint, convinces Ty Ty that the local albino, Dave Dawson, has magical powers that can divine exactly where the gold is located. Because of this information, Ty Ty believes that wealth and prosperity are imminent. But life within the Walden family is not happy. They have no money and because of Ty Ty's singular focus, the farm is not producing. A jealous Buck believes that his wife, Griselda, would rather be with her ex-beau, Will Thompson, who happens to be married to Rosamund, Ty Ty's daughter. Rosamund, in turn, is scared of her husband, who has been floundering in life ever since he lost his job when the local textile mill closed. Ty Ty's youngest daughter ""Darlin'"" Jill is just coming of age and is a flirt. And the entire family is estranged from Jim Leslie, another of Ty Ty's sons, who married into money and feels he's better than the rest of his family. Regardless of the reasons for these problems, Ty Ty believes the gold will solve everything.

                    When 'Vogler's Magnetic Health Theater' comes to town, there's bound to be a spectacle. Reading reports of a variety of supernatural disturbances at Vogler's prior performances abroad, the leading townspeople (including the police chief and medical examiner) request that their troupe provide them a sample of their act, before allowing them public audiences. The scientific-minded disbelievers try to expose them as charlatans, but Vogler and his crew prove too clever for them.

                    1848. Vogler's Magnetic Health Theater is a small Swedish performing troupe that travels throughout Europe. Most of the troupe members are related to its leader, ""Dr."" Albert Emanuel Vogler. The nature of their shows are largely related to supernatural phenomenon. Because of the assertions made at their performances and the seemingly unscientific nature, some authority figures question whether they should be allowed to perform. That is what happens at their latest stop, where they are summoned to the home of a local merchant, Mr. Egerman, and his wife, so that they can discuss and demonstrate their performance to the authorities, including Dr. Vergerus, the Minister of Health, and Police Superintendent Starbeck, who will decide if the show is fit for public consumption in their town. Dr. Vergerus in particular seems bent on shutting them down especially if the acts in the show cannot be scientifically explained, and thus cause harm to an unsuspecting public. While Vergerus, Starbeck and Egerman are working on their own agenda not fully disclosed, Vogler and his troupe may have a few undisclosed issues of their own, as well as a few tricks up their sleeves to deal with their inquisitors.

Finding himself attracted to her, he pretends to be a student in her class, not revealing he's Gannon, whom she despises. As they bob and weave around their mutual growing attraction, they both begin to gain respect for each other's approaches to reporting news, but how will Erica react when she finds out who he really is?

However his boss Lloyd Crowley gives direct orders to him to attend the class.

However, they feel both attracted by each other and Erica believes that Gannon has a great potential to be a journalist. When Erica dates the talented Dr. Hugo Pine, Gannon goes to the same restaurant and disputes Erica's attention with Dr. Pine.

                    Without yet having met, James Gannon, the hard nosed city desk editor of the New York Daily Chronicle, and E.R. Stone - Erica - a night school journalism instructor at a local college, get into a philosophical war of words. He believes that newspaper journalism is a trade that can only be learned through on the job training. Additionally, he believes that people who teach journalism probably have not spent a day in their life working at a newspaper, E.R. Stone included. He also has disdain for any of his staff who have studied journalism at school, he himself not even having ever graduated from high school. As such, he tersely declines her invitation to provide a guest lecture to her class. Their war ratchets up a level when she reads his letter to her class, she unaware that he is sitting in her class at the time, he who has come to abide her request as directed by his managing editor. Because of her diatribe against him, he decides to enroll in her class incognito as James Gallagher to show her up. Their war softens, at least from Jim's side, as he can't help but be attracted to her as a person. And Erica, not knowing his true identity, is enthralled with her new pupil, who is the most naturally gifted writer she has ever had in any of her classes. As Jim and Erica get closer personally and professionally, not only is his true identity a major obstacle in their relationship if she ever discovers it, but seemingly so is Dr. Hugo Pine, a Renaissance man of a psychology professor at the college who Jim assumes is her suitor. Jim ultimately may be able to use Hugo's profession and knowledge of Erica for his own benefit in getting closer to her. But learning directly from her of her motivations in life, based on idolizing a Pulitzer Prize winning editorialist, may give him a clearer picture of who Erica is as a person.

The posse pauses at a mountain pass and then they decide to leave Parral behind to prevent anyone from following them through the pass. Douglas catches up with the posse the next day at the pass, where they are held up trying to dislodge the outlaw.Douglas corners the outlaw Parral and shows him a picture of his wife in the cover of his pocket watch.

The sheriff invites Simms to see the men he is to hang, but Simms chooses to wait until the town's residents are at church for a pre-execution mass.While pretending to evaluate the men he is to hang, Simms stabs the sheriff in the back. The sheriff shoots and kills Simms in the struggle, but the inmates strangle the sheriff until he is unconscious.The four take his keys and escape, taking Emma as a hostage. The wounded sheriff interrupts the church service and tells the townspeople that the prisoners have escaped. The townspeople form a posse to ride out immediately and enlist Douglas to help them track down the outlaws, but Douglas is in no hurry and waits until morning. The posse pauses at a mountain pass and then they decide to leave Parral behind to prevent anyone from following them through the pass. Douglas catches up with the posse the next day at the pass, where they are held up trying to dislodge the outlaw.Douglas corners the outlaw Parral and shows him a picture of his wife in the cover of his pocket watch. Parral says he's never seen her before. Douglas accuses him of being one of the four who killed his wife. Parral denies it, pleading for his life, but Douglas kills him. Douglas follows the outlaws and next tracks down Taylor. He lassos Taylor by the feet and hangs him upside-down from a tree, leaving him to die. The two remaining men reach the house of John Butler (Gene Evans), a prospector and Douglas's neighbor. Zachary kills Butler and Lujan steals the sack of coins that Butler tried to run off with. Zachary attacks Emma, but Lujan sees someone approaching in the distance and tells Zachary they must leave, and after Zachary rapes Emma they leave. Josefa and Douglas arrive at Butler's cabin from different directions where Douglas identifies Butler's body. The posse arrives and finds an injured Emma in Butler's cabin. Douglas tells the posse to ride on while he goes back to his ranch to get fresh horses.When Douglas arrives at his home he finds that the fugitives have taken his last horses. Leaving Josefa with his daughter, he rejoins the posse. When they arrive at the Mexican border, the other members of the posse refuse to cross the border and Douglas goes on alone. He finds Zachary in a bar and shows him the photo of his wife. Zachary says he has never seen the woman before and asks what Douglas wants. Douglas insists that Zachary is one of the four who killed his wife, and Zachary pulls his weapon in self-defense, but Douglas kills him first.Douglas see Lujan run away. Lujan greets his wife and learns that his son is ill. Douglas tracks Lujan to his home and arrives to find him fetching water. Lujan's wife, seeing that Douglas intends to harm her husband, knocks him out with a clay pot. Regaining consciousness, Lujan holds Douglas at the point of his own gun. Douglas shows Lujan the photo of his wife. Like the other three, Lujan says he has never seen the woman before. Douglas asks why Lujan is riding one of Douglas' horses, and Lujan says that he and his companions rode past the Douglas ranch on their way from the border. Pointing to the sack, Douglas states that the men who killed his wife stole the sack containing the family's life savings. When Lujan tells Douglas that he took the bag from Butler's dead hand, Douglas realizes that Butler killed his wife.Douglas realizes that he has been pursuing men who had nothing to do with his wife's death. He remembers that he showed each of them a picture of his wife, and all of them denied ever having seen her. Douglas sees that he is no better than the men he has been pursuing, having murdered them in cold blood. He returns to the town where the hanging was to take place and goes to the church to beg forgiveness from the pastor. The priest (Andrew Duggan) says that Douglas did what he felt was right and to his credit, does not take refuge in the fact that they were outlaws anyway. Josefa then arrives with Douglas' daughter, and as they exit the church together, the sheriff and the townspeople celebrate Douglas' success at tracking down and killing the men.

With this, Ivan is now absolutely sure that Efrosinia was his wife's poisoner.Fyodor Basmanov notices Pyotr leaving, someone who did not belong in the party, and signals Ivan.Ivan, pretending surprise at Vladimir's revelation, suggests to Vladimir that being Tsar is not so bad. He convinces Vladimir to try being Tsar for a while, and has the Oprichnina bring throne, orb, scepter, crown and royal robes. Vladimir is dressed up as Tsar and they all bow down to ""Tsar Vladimir.""Then Ivan tells Vladimir to lead them, in full regalia, to the cathedral to pray, as a Tsar should lead. With much hesitation and fear, Vladimir does. In the cathedral, the assassin runs up and stabs the mock Tsar, and is immediately seized by Fyodor and Malyuta.Ivan orders them to release Pyotr, and thanks him for killing the tsar's worst enemy. Efrosinia arrives, jubilant at the apparent death of Ivan, until she sees Ivan alive. Rolling the corpse over, she sees it is her own son, screeches in desperation while holding Vladimir in a pose reminiscent of Michelangelo's Pietá.Ivan sentences her. Then, in a final soliloquy, Ivan proclaims that all his enemies within Moscow are vanquished so he can now concentrate to those outside.

                    While working as a counselor at a summer camp, college-student Marjorie Morgenstern falls for 32-year-old Noel Airman, a would-be dramatist working at a nearby summer theater. Like Marjorie, he is an upper-middle-class New York Jew (born 'Ehrman'), but has fallen away from his roots, and Marjorie's parents object among other things to his lack of a suitable profession, such as medicine or law. Noel himself warns Marjorie repeatedly that she's much too naive and conventional for him, but they nonetheless fall in love. As they pursue an on-again-off-again relationship, Marjorie completes her studies at Hunter College, and works to establish an acting career, while Noel first leaves the theater for a job with an advertising agency, but later completes a musical he'd started writing before he and Marjorie had first met. Meanwhile, their relationship deepens (though, consistent with '50s Hollywood mores, the more full-fledged sexuality in their relationship is never explicitly communicated). They plan to marry, but after the musical's critical failure on Broadway, Noel runs away. Marjorie finally tracks him down at the summer theater where they first met--and, realizing that this is probably where he belongs, finally gives up on the relationship. Helping her to move on with her life is Wally, once Noel's assistant, now a very successful Broadway playwright, and all along, Marjorie's unrequited lover. The movie ends with a clear implication Wally and Marjorie will finally be a couple.

"66","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051381/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Title and credits run over an image of people in glass cylinders with metal top and bottom caps. We open with a cityscape and busy traffic dissolving to a lobby newsstand in an office building. A letter carrier, Ernie Larson (Jamie Forster) drops off mail while a Brownie troop waits for the elevator. The troop leader (June Jocelyn) asks the postman, ""Sir, can you please tell me where I can find Dolls, Incorporated."" ""Room 502,"" is the reply. The group enters the office and is greeted by the receptionist, Janet Hall (Jean Moorhead). The girls examine the doll collection display while they wait for Mr. Franz and their tour of the facility. When a little girl reaches for one of eight dolls displayed in glass cylinders, Janet runs over and warns them, ""Don't let Mr. Franz catch you. He's very particular about these dolls. Nobody is allowed to touch them.""Sally Reynolds (June Kenney) stops at Dolls, Inc. holding the newspaper classified section. She's responding to a Help Wanted Ad. There is no receptionist to greet her. She picks up a doll on the desk to examine it and is startled by the owner, Mr. Franz (John Hoyt). Mr. Franz proudly shows off a few dolls in his collection. He explains that the dolls are his friends. His strange attachment to his dolls is disquieting and Sally tells Mr. Franz, ""I don't think I'm the girl for the job."" She starts to walk away. After she explains that she is unmarried, with no family, he tells her, ""You're exactly the one I want, Miss Reynolds. I'd like you to start right away."" Sally reluctantly agrees to stay. She starts by answering the telephone, a call from Mr. Grant. Mr. Grant is inquiring about Janet Hall. He is informed she quit to go work for another company. It is that company calling to find out where she is. Franz picks up a doll in the cylinder and is interrupted by Sally asking about the company books. We zoom in on a doll that looks remarkably like Janet Hall.Sally is busy at her desk when Bob Westley (John Agar) walks into the office. She informs Bob she has been on the job for six weeks. He inquires about Franz and when told he is busy, Bob enters the factory section without permission. Sally lays down the law, ""Please don't get me into trouble. Mr. Franz is in the back room, and when he's in that room, he never wants to be disturbed."" Bob apologizes and asks to be friends. She volunteers she is a little afraid of her boss and that he is peculiar. The next morning Bob and Sally enter the elevator together. He sarcastically asks her, ""Been dreaming up anything new about the boss?"" A special delivery man (Hal Bogart) asks the elevator operator (Troy Patterson) the floor for Dolls, Inc. He is told the fifth floor. Sally volunteers to take the letter as she works there. She is told that it is registered and for Miss Hall. The elevator operator asks the deliveryman about the letter carrier, Ernie. He is told that two days before retirement he just disappeared.Franz signs for Janet's letter and tells the delivery man he expects to see her in a few days. He invites Bob into the factory, closing the door to his back room. On a peg behind the door is a leather U.S. Mail delivery pouch. A doll company salesman (Mark Lowell as Harold Franklin) stops by with samples of dolls his company sells wholesale. Franz examines one and orders four gross. He asks Sally which one she likes and she chooses the one wearing, ""white organdy with the blue ribbon."" Franz casually tells her, ""It's a pity you can't model it for us, although I can see it would be very becoming on you. Yes."" He orders two gross and asks to keep the sample doll. When Sally dumps the trash can from the factory floor into the office trashcan she discovers the torn and discarded pieces of the special delivery letter for Janet Hall. She reassembles the pieces.Franz and Bob are working in the factory when Sally calls to tell her boss that an old friend of his has come to visit. As Bob exits the factory room, Emil (Michael mark) enters and greets Franz. He is a puppeteer and invites Franz to catch a performance. Franz reveals he was in show business but now just works with dolls. Emil inquires about Emma. Franz explains, ""She left me."" They leave for dinner and stop at the Theater to see the marionettes. Emil offers Franz a partnership, but Franz declines. Emil presses the issue, but Franz is adamant. He tells his old friend, ""I love my dolls and I'm quite sure they'll never leave me."" They exit the theater for dinner and plan to return later to the factory. The janitor (Hank Patterson) is eating a sandwich.Bob and Sally are out on a date. They attend the Rosecrans Drive-In and watch ""The Amazing Colossal Man"" starring Glenn Langan, another Bert I. Gordon movie. Sally asks if Bob is returning to St. Louis the next day. He tells her, ""Maybe. Would you like to come with me?"" He proposes marriage to her. They kiss. He suggests they fly to Las Vegas and get married the next day. She agrees. They agree to meet at 10:00 a.m. the next day.It is just past 11:00 a.m. and Sally is packed but Bob hasn't arrived. Franz calls her at home to inquire about her absence. She asks about Bob, as he was meeting with Franz that morning and was supposed to tell him she was quitting her job. Franz tells Sally that Bob returned to St. Louis. Now she thinks Bob has played a cruel joke on her. When she gets back to the office she asks a few more questions about Bob. Franz tells her that Bob did ask Sally to marry him. Then Franz volunteers something ominous, ""Bob gave me to understand that you wouldn't work for me after you were married. I begged him not to take you away. I told him how sad it is when people go."" Sally starts to cry. Franz reassures her. She picks up a doll in a glass cylinder that looks exactly like Bob Westley. She comments on how lifelike it is. He takes the doll and places it in the front office display case, then departs. Unable to open the display case with a key she found, Sally uses her shoe to force the lock. She slides open the glass and removes Bob's doll from the display.Sally visits the missing persons department at police headquarters. She is met by the police receptionist (George Diestel) who directs Sally to Sgt. Paterson (Jack Kosslyn). She reviews the report she filed earlier about Bob with Paterson. She tells Paterson she thinks Franz, ""Did something to him."" She finally tells the Sergeant that Franz turned him into a doll. She adds that Janet Hall and the mailman, Ernie may have met the same fate. Paterson agrees to talk to Franz. When they arrive at Dolls, Inc. Sally notices the Bob doll is missing from the display case. They enter the factory room to confront Franz. Bob's likeness is sitting on the desk in front of Franz. He tells Paterson the reason the doll is so lifelike is, ""I model all my dolls after people I know and like. People I like to have near me. Nothing wrong with that, is there?"" Paterson examines the doll. To show it is just a doll, Franz lights a match and burns it in the glass cylinder. He shows Paterson and Sally a case of six more Bob dolls. Paterson tells Sally, ""Well, kind of looks like your boyfriend took a powder, doesn't it?"" Paterson leaves. Sally is left feeling foolish and humiliated. Franz walks over and locks the door. Sally demands that the door be unlocked. She screams.She wakes a short time later and screams when she sees a giant telephone next to her. Franz towers over her and warns, ""Be careful my dear. Surely you aren't afraid of me, are you?"" He tells her to get dressed to meet her fiancé. He hands her the dress she admired a few weeks before on the sample doll, now just her size. ""Remember, you selected this yourself,"" he reminds her. Franz retrieves Bob and reassures her, ""Only asleep Miss Reynolds. What you might call a state of suspended animation."" She pulls off the cover and Bob awakens. He exits the tube. Bob throws a brush and comb at Franz. Franz tells the pair they should be grateful. They are free from all the cares of the world. He further explains the process for shrinking people. To demonstrate, he pours a saucer of milk and calls for his cat, Tommy. He explains the process involves breaking down a structure using high frequency vibrations. The cat appears and is placed on a table. Franz turns on a machine and the cat is transferred from one table full sized to another table shrunk down to the size of a caterpillar. He hands the cat to Sally to hold. Franz retrieves four more cylinders from the display case in the front office. Bob pulls Georgia Lane (Laurie Mitchell) out of her cylinder. Franz introduces them. Laurie (Marlene Willis) joins them. Georgia tells Laurie she's been asleep for a couple of months. Stan (Ken Miller) is next out of his container. The last revived is Mac the Marine (Scott Peters). Georgia, Laurie, Stan and Mac are used to their situation and insist they party. Franz retrieves a tiny bottle of champagne for his guests. Bob and Sally are horrified at their predicament. She scolds her companions, ""Stop! All of you stop! How can you be so calm?"" Georgia explains she took about ten minutes to get adjusted and she likes her new size. Franz returns to the back room carrying a record player. Stan and Laurie dance, while Mac and Georgia sip champagne from their oversized tea cups. Franz insists Laurie sing for her new companions. Franz leaves to answer the door. Emil stops by to report on his opening night performance.Bob and Sally try to call the police on the oversized telephone, but the record player is too loud and the policeman can't hear their tiny voices calling for help. Franz is impatient to get back to his captives. Bob uses the cord on the phone handset to get off the table. Stan and Mac join him in their plan to use the machine to reverse the process. As the music plays, Stan hooks a string to the door to get to the lock. Mac gets on the table and Bob tries the controls on the machine. Franz is beside himself and tries to brush off Emil, but changes his mind. Bob, Stan, and Mac abort the plaN and return to the work bench. Franz and Emil agree to meet the next day. Franz returns to the back room and returns the six to suspended animation.A Help Wanted note hangs in the lobby and Sgt. Paterson sees it. He stops in to see Franz and asks about Sally. Franz lies and tells Paterson she went to St. Louis to be with her fiancé. Paterson tells him Bob is also missing. A little girl arrives at the office carrying her broken doll. Agnes (Susan Gordon) asks, ""Mister, can you fix my dolly?"" Franz examines the doll while making small talk. Peterson asks about the back room and is told, It's just a work room. When he asks to see it he is given the key. Agnes notices Tommy crawling out of a matchbox on the table. She grabs the box after the cat crawls back inside and demands to keep it. Peterson asks about the machine. Franz offers to demonstrate, but Peterson leaves before he is next to join the collection. Franz distracts Agnes with a doll and retrieves his cat.Emil stops by to have a marionette repaired. He asks Franz about a visit he got from the police. Paterson had questioned Emil about Franz. Franz is now spooked and packs his special dolls. He drops Sally's jar and wakes her. He tells her about the police inquiry and his plan to kill himself and his special dolls. His captives are awakened and told to bathe and dress themselves for a night on the town. They write a Help Note on a piece of paper, then told it up into a paper airplane and throw it towards an open window. The attempt to summon help fails. Franz packs them in a suitcase and takes a taxi to Emil's Theater. He returns Emil's Dr. Jekyll marionette but decides to put on a little play with the puppet. The janitor interrupts his rehearsal. As the eight captives try to signal the janitor, Franz warns the janitor to not come out on the stage. Sally, Bob, and Georgia are asked to participate in his impromptu scene with the Dr. Jekyll puppet. Bob places a sleeping pill in Franz's coffee cup. Bob gets angry and destroys the Dr. Jekyll puppet. Again he is interrupted by the janitor and drinks the now drugged coffee. He notices Bob and Sally are gone, along with the rest of his collection.Bob and Sally escape the Theater and are chased by a rat and a cat. They walk back to the building on deserted city streets. It is early in the morning. When they arrive they need a plan to get up to the fifth floor. They decide to use the freight elevator when they notice a delivery man (Bill Giorgio) stacking boxes. They are menaced by a dog. They cut a whole in a box and wait inside until the box is delivered to Dolls, Inc. Inside the office they head for the lab. Franz arrives at the office and notices the hole in the box. Before he can act, Agnes arrives and calls for him at the office door. Paterson arrives. Agnes tells him about the machine and the kitty. Paterson decides no one is at the office and takes Agnes to school. By the time Franz gets to the machine Bob and Sally are full sized and tell Franz they are going straight to the police. We close with a pan of the factory floor and two empty cylinders.","
    
                    Deranged doll-maker Mr. Franz is deathly afraid of being left alone, so he creates a machine that can shrink humans down to only a few inches tall. He soon accumulates a troupe of shrunken prisoners whom he forces to perform for him and keep him company. When he shrinks his secretary Sally and her fiance Bob, the pair decide against spending their days as pint-sized playthings and try to find a way to escape and re-enlarge themselves.

We open with a police car driving into frame. It is early evening on a desolate highway in the desert. Sheriff Cramer (Lee Roberts) is searching for two inmates who've escaped. He will next search the Dayton rocket installation. Steve Dayton (Richard Travis), Dirk Green (Michael Whalen) and Col. Wickers (Henry Hunter) are reviewing Dirk's advanced designs in rocket science. Wickers heaps praise on Dirk, but tells him the government will be taking over, explaining, ""Gentlemen, you must understand that missile experimentation is government business. Strictly government!"" Steve tries to champion private enterprise, speaking more for Dirk than himself, which he confides later to Col. Wickers. Wickers tells the pair, ""I'm only carrying out orders. Tomorrow morning, a team of government experts will take over."" The meeting is interrupted by the Sheriff. He tells of the escape of two prisoners from the County Farm and asks permission to search the grounds and around the rocket. The rocket itself is protected by an electric perimeter fence. Dirk escorts the Sheriff out of the office. Steve and the Colonel discuss how he came to collaborate with Dirk. He reveals the project's scope includes a trip to the moon. June Saxton (Cathy Downs) enters the office and is introduced as Steve's fiancée. Dirk and the Sheriff arrive at the rocket site gate. Dirk warns the Sheriff not to touch the fence. As he gets his key to unlock the switch box, he notices the lock is unsecured and the power already cut. While the pair search around the rocket, the two escaped prisoners wander around inside the rocket. Gene Fennell (Tommy Cook), the shorter, tougher of the pair complains about the choice of hide out, ""This was a great idea, like hiding out in a gas chamber. The place gives me the creeps."" [Note: While credited as Gene, his character is frequently addressed as Gary.] Lon (Gary Clarke) is tall, slim and the smarter of the two. They decide the rocket may not be the best choice after all, but when they try to leave they notice Dirk and the Sheriff below. The convicts walk up the ladder to the control room. The Sheriff insists the rocket be searched, but Dirk convinces him he should search his own rocket. Dirk opens the hatch to the control room, sees the pair, smiles and tells the Sheriff, ""There's no one here!"" Dirk walks back down the latter, closing and locking the hatch behind him. Gene and Lon are locked in and very unhappy about it.Dirk returns to the office. Steve and June are having a drink and invite Dirk to join in the celebration. Dirk is not in the mood and tells them, ""Nobody's going to take over my work. I designed and built that ship to fly into space and I'm going to see that it does."" Dirk grabs a gun from his desk and exits the office. The escapees argue, with Lon expressing regrets for his involvement with Gene. Dirk enters the rocket with food for his newly acquired ""crew"". He presents Lon and Gene with a fait accompli. They can join Dirk as his crew to fly the rocket to the moon or be shot and killed on the spot. Gene still wants to leave, but is persuaded when Dirk completes his proposal with a gun in his hand. Lon is intrigued by the idea and agrees. The pair change clothes and prepare for launch. In the office, the rocket launch system activates which gets Steve and June's attention. They go to the rocket to investigate. Dirk prepares for launch and instructs Lon and Gene on their duties. Steve and June enter the ship. Before they can leave, the door closes trapping them inside a compartment with no climate control. They don oxygen masks and prepare themselves for launch.Launch was successful, but a counterbalance indicator alarm indicates something wrong below deck. Lon checks and discovers the two stowaways. Steve requires assistance to be brought around. Dirk proudly announces, ""We're thousands of miles in space. Everything is working as we designed it. We're on course and everything is under control."" Steve and June are introduced to Dirk's crew. Dirk laughs when he tells them they are the two escaped convicts. Gene immediately takes a liking to June and a dislike for Steve. Steve, Dirk and June check mission parameters. Steve and Lon go topside to check on equipment, and Dirk goes below. That leaves June and Gene alone. Gene makes a clumsy and unwanted pass at June. She tries to fight him off. Dirk's early return results in a warning to Gene to leave June alone, and a fight between the two takes place. A meteor shower stops the fight. A battery strap is broken, and Dirk goes to secure it. The battery falls on his head and he is seriously injured. While Gene and Lon move the battery, Steve attends to Dirk. Realizing he is dying, Dirk tells him, ""The controls are preset so the ship will land in a specified area. Don't change it, you must land there."" He gives Steve a medallion and tells him not to lose it, he will need it where they are going. Before he dies of his injuries, Dirk calls out, ""Lido. My Lido. Forgive me. Forgive."" Steve examines the medallion and reviews their situation. He suspects something unusual will happen on the moon. They approach the moon, and the automatic sequence for landing begins. They land and change into their spacesuits. They descend to the moon's surface and begin their exploration of the satellite. They stay in shadow to avoid the heat of the direct sun. They pass an outcropping rocks. The pile begins to move. They hear something, but dismiss it as a rock slide. The rock creatures begin to follow them. The four walk through a valley, past another rock creature, but this time they see it move. June screams and they see three more creatures all coming from different directions. They try firing pistols at the rock creatures, but bullets have no effect. They run to a cave to hide. Once inside, they notice the creatures won't enter the cave. They walk back deeper into the cave system. Lon discovers a torch, and June sees a light deeper inside. They discover a lighted torch, which means there is oxygen in the cave. They remove their space suits, secure them behind some rocks, and explore further. They conclude a higher form of life lives in the caves. Gene threatens to return to the ship, but wanders deeper into the cave. He encounters something, then screams. They smell gas as a hooded figure confronts them. They collapse.Sometime later they wake in the well-appointed throne room. The Lido (K.T. Stevens) enters wearing an elaborate gown and headdress. She is blind and welcomes them to Olanda. She introduces herself and sits on her throne. She offers the visitors/captives food and drink, provided by her court of eight beautiful women. The four eat the food provided and proclaim it delicious. The Lido proudly tells them, ""I am pleased to see that you find of offerings satisfying. It may interest you to know that the food in front of you was produced long before I was born."" The astronauts wince, then all put the food back down on the plates. A wine bearer notices Dirk's medallion around Steve's neck and reports it to the Lido. The Lido asks for the medallion and Steve is escorted back to the throne. Alpha (Nina Bara) takes the medallion from around Steve's neck and presents it to the Lido. The Lido is happy thinking that Dark has returned from his mission to Earth. Steve is mistaken for Dirk, an error he is not anxious to correct until he can learn more of their circumstances. The Lido and Steve retire to another room to talk. She inquires about Earth and volunteers that their world is dying, ""Our oxygen is disappearing. Our food supply is dwindling. Soon this satellite will be barren; devoid of life."" The Lido also mentions that he is to be married to Alpha after his briefing is completed.Gene is now happy to be surrounded by beautiful women waiting on him hand and foot. He takes an immediate interest in Lambda (Laurie Mitchell) and they leave to be alone. Gene notices Lambda's diamonds and asks for the source. In the throne room, Lon takes a shine to Zema (Leslie Parris as Marjorie Hellen). June starts to display a little insecurity and jealousy. The Lido tells Steve, still thinking he is Dirk, ""From what you tell me Dirk, the planet Earth would not satisfy our needs. Fortunately I have another destination in mind. Tell the Earth people they are not to consider themselves prisoners. They may move about as the wish, provided they do not try to escape. You will rejoin them now."" Steve and June talk. He reveals the Lido is blind and thinks he's Dirk and they want the rocket. Lon and Zema get acquainted. She tells him of her world and the rock creatures aversion to oxygen. When Steve tells June of his upcoming wedding to Alpha she reacts badly. She gets in a fight with Alpha and reveals Steve's real identity. Lon and Steve breakup the catfight. Alpha proclaims, ""She will die,"" then storms off. They plan their escape as Alpha reveals the plot to the Lido. The Lido pretends she knew Steve's real identity, but Alpha does not believe the story. She challenges her leadership, using some mind control technique, but is unsuccessful. The defeated Alpha pretends to follow her Lido's orders. Deep in the caves Gene is gathering up a couple of huge, uncut diamonds. Alpha takes it upon herself to unleash a giant spider to track down and kill the earth people.Steve, June and Lon wander the caves looking for Gene and their spacesuits. They find the spot where they hid them, but discover them now missing. Gene and Lambda join the three. Lambda warns them they must leave the caves immediately, but concludes that it is now too late. She runs off and is caught and killed by the giant spider. The four are captured and returned to the throne room. Steve chats with Alpha. She reveals to Steve that she still intends to proceed with the wedding. Alpha hypnotizes Steve to obey her orders. Alpha and the Lido talk, but the discussion ends with a knife plunged into the Lido's back. Alpha succeeds in taking over as the new Lido. Alpha's first order of business is June's execution followed by her wedding to Steve. Steve, dressed in a ceremonial gown, pronounces June's death order. June is hauled off to the extermination chamber. The ceremonial dance begins, as June is chained to a cross and a giant spider is released from a caged section of the cave. Zema has fallen in love with Lon, and helps in his escape with Gene. She gives the pair a key to the closet containing their space suits and tells them where to find June. She promises to set Steve free to join them in their escape. June screams when she sees the spider approaching and faints. Gene and Lon shoot the giant arachnid, a white powder is expelled from its mouth as it collapses in death. They unchain June. Gene dismisses himself to retrieve as many diamonds as he can carry. Alpha notices the missing earthmen and halts the ceremony. Lambda confronts Alpha, using her mind control talents, releases Steve from his spell. She and Alpha have a mind control battle. Weakened by her earlier battle she decides to sacrifice herself for Lon's safety and throws a bomb in the throne room, which causes the oxygen to be evacuated. Steve, Lon, and June don their space suits and exit the cave. As Alpha is dying she still tries to influence Steve with her mind control. It almost succeeds, but she dies first. Gene, carrying two large bags of diamonds, hurries to join his shipmates. The three start back for the ship, staying in the shade. Gene exits the cave, but a rock creature is between him and his shipmates. Gene's greed overcomes his better judgment, and he refuses to drop the diamonds which is hindering his progress. He is surrounded by rock creatures and wanders back into the sun. His body begins to smoke. He screams, then he bursts into flames. All that quickly remains is a smoldering skeleton. The three survivors get back to the ship. We close with the rocket blasting off from the moons surface.","

Dirk opens the hatch to the control room, sees the pair, smiles and tells the Sheriff, ""There's no one here!"" Dirk walks back down the latter, closing and locking the hatch behind him. Gene and Lon are locked in and very unhappy about it.Dirk returns to the office. Steve and June are having a drink and invite Dirk to join in the celebration. Dirk is not in the mood and tells them, ""Nobody's going to take over my work. I designed and built that ship to fly into space and I'm going to see that it does."" Dirk grabs a gun from his desk and exits the office. The escapees argue, with Lon expressing regrets for his involvement with Gene. Dirk enters the rocket with food for his newly acquired ""crew"". He presents Lon and Gene with a fait accompli. They can join Dirk as his crew to fly the rocket to the moon or be shot and killed on the spot. Gene still wants to leave, but is persuaded when Dirk completes his proposal with a gun in his hand. Lon is intrigued by the idea and agrees. The pair change clothes and prepare for launch. In the office, the rocket launch system activates which gets Steve and June's attention. They go to the rocket to investigate. Dirk prepares for launch and instructs Lon and Gene on their duties. Steve and June enter the ship. Before they can leave, the door closes trapping them inside a compartment with no climate control. They don oxygen masks and prepare themselves for launch.Launch was successful, but a counterbalance indicator alarm indicates something wrong below deck. Lon checks and discovers the two stowaways. Steve requires assistance to be brought around. Dirk proudly announces, ""We're thousands of miles in space. Everything is working as we designed it. We're on course and everything is under control."" Steve and June are introduced to Dirk's crew. Dirk laughs when he tells them they are the two escaped convicts. Gene immediately takes a liking to June and a dislike for Steve. Steve, Dirk and June check mission parameters. Steve and Lon go topside to check on equipment, and Dirk goes below. That leaves June and Gene alone. Gene makes a clumsy and unwanted pass at June. She tries to fight him off. Dirk's early return results in a warning to Gene to leave June alone, and a fight between the two takes place. A meteor shower stops the fight. A battery strap is broken, and Dirk goes to secure it. The battery falls on his head and he is seriously injured. While Gene and Lon move the battery, Steve attends to Dirk. Realizing he is dying, Dirk tells him, ""The controls are preset so the ship will land in a specified area. Don't change it, you must land there."" He gives Steve a medallion and tells him not to lose it, he will need it where they are going. Before he dies of his injuries, Dirk calls out, ""Lido. My Lido. Forgive me. Forgive."" Steve examines the medallion and reviews their situation. He suspects something unusual will happen on the moon. They approach the moon, and the automatic sequence for landing begins. They land and change into their spacesuits. They descend to the moon's surface and begin their exploration of the satellite. They stay in shadow to avoid the heat of the direct sun. They pass an outcropping rocks. The pile begins to move. They hear something, but dismiss it as a rock slide. The rock creatures begin to follow them. The four walk through a valley, past another rock creature, but this time they see it move. June screams and they see three more creatures all coming from different directions. They try firing pistols at the rock creatures, but bullets have no effect. They run to a cave to hide. Once inside, they notice the creatures won't enter the cave. They walk back deeper into the cave system. Lon discovers a torch, and June sees a light deeper inside. They discover a lighted torch, which means there is oxygen in the cave. They remove their space suits, secure them behind some rocks, and explore further. They conclude a higher form of life lives in the caves. Gene threatens to return to the ship, but wanders deeper into the cave. He encounters something, then screams. They smell gas as a hooded figure confronts them. They collapse.Sometime later they wake in the well-appointed throne room. The Lido (K.T. Stevens) enters wearing an elaborate gown and headdress. She is blind and welcomes them to Olanda. She introduces herself and sits on her throne. She offers the visitors/captives food and drink, provided by her court of eight beautiful women. The four eat the food provided and proclaim it delicious. The Lido proudly tells them, ""I am pleased to see that you find of offerings satisfying. It may interest you to know that the food in front of you was produced long before I was born."" The astronauts wince, then all put the food back down on the plates. A wine bearer notices Dirk's medallion around Steve's neck and reports it to the Lido. The Lido asks for the medallion and Steve is escorted back to the throne. Alpha (Nina Bara) takes the medallion from around Steve's neck and presents it to the Lido. The Lido is happy thinking that Dark has returned from his mission to Earth. Steve is mistaken for Dirk, an error he is not anxious to correct until he can learn more of their circumstances. The Lido and Steve retire to another room to talk. She inquires about Earth and volunteers that their world is dying, ""Our oxygen is disappearing. Our food supply is dwindling. Soon this satellite will be barren; devoid of life."" The Lido also mentions that he is to be married to Alpha after his briefing is completed.Gene is now happy to be surrounded by beautiful women waiting on him hand and foot. He takes an immediate interest in Lambda (Laurie Mitchell) and they leave to be alone. Gene notices Lambda's diamonds and asks for the source. In the throne room, Lon takes a shine to Zema (Leslie Parris as Marjorie Hellen). June starts to display a little insecurity and jealousy. The Lido tells Steve, still thinking he is Dirk, ""From what you tell me Dirk, the planet Earth would not satisfy our needs. Fortunately I have another destination in mind. Tell the Earth people they are not to consider themselves prisoners. They may move about as the wish, provided they do not try to escape. You will rejoin them now."" Steve and June talk. He reveals the Lido is blind and thinks he's Dirk and they want the rocket. Lon and Zema get acquainted. She tells him of her world and the rock creatures aversion to oxygen. When Steve tells June of his upcoming wedding to Alpha she reacts badly. She gets in a fight with Alpha and reveals Steve's real identity. Lon and Steve breakup the catfight. Alpha proclaims, ""She will die,"" then storms off. They plan their escape as Alpha reveals the plot to the Lido. The Lido pretends she knew Steve's real identity, but Alpha does not believe the story. She challenges her leadership, using some mind control technique, but is unsuccessful. The defeated Alpha pretends to follow her Lido's orders. Deep in the caves Gene is gathering up a couple of huge, uncut diamonds. Alpha takes it upon herself to unleash a giant spider to track down and kill the earth people.Steve, June and Lon wander the caves looking for Gene and their spacesuits. They find the spot where they hid them, but discover them now missing. Gene and Lambda join the three. Lambda warns them they must leave the caves immediately, but concludes that it is now too late. She runs off and is caught and killed by the giant spider. The four are captured and returned to the throne room. Steve chats with Alpha. She reveals to Steve that she still intends to proceed with the wedding. Alpha hypnotizes Steve to obey her orders. Alpha and the Lido talk, but the discussion ends with a knife plunged into the Lido's back. Alpha succeeds in taking over as the new Lido. Alpha's first order of business is June's execution followed by her wedding to Steve. Steve, dressed in a ceremonial gown, pronounces June's death order. June is hauled off to the extermination chamber. The ceremonial dance begins, as June is chained to a cross and a giant spider is released from a caged section of the cave. Zema has fallen in love with Lon, and helps in his escape with Gene. She gives the pair a key to the closet containing their space suits and tells them where to find June. She promises to set Steve free to join them in their escape. June screams when she sees the spider approaching and faints. Gene and Lon shoot the giant arachnid, a white powder is expelled from its mouth as it collapses in death. They unchain June. Gene dismisses himself to retrieve as many diamonds as he can carry. Alpha notices the missing earthmen and halts the ceremony. Lambda confronts Alpha, using her mind control talents, releases Steve from his spell. She and Alpha have a mind control battle. Weakened by her earlier battle she decides to sacrifice herself for Lon's safety and throws a bomb in the throne room, which causes the oxygen to be evacuated. Steve, Lon, and June don their space suits and exit the cave. As Alpha is dying she still tries to influence Steve with her mind control. It almost succeeds, but she dies first. Gene, carrying two large bags of diamonds, hurries to join his shipmates. The three start back for the ship, staying in the shade. Gene exits the cave, but a rock creature is between him and his shipmates. Gene's greed overcomes his better judgment, and he refuses to drop the diamonds which is hindering his progress. He is surrounded by rock creatures and wanders back into the sun. His body begins to smoke. He screams, then he bursts into flames. All that quickly remains is a smoldering skeleton. The three survivors get back to the ship. We close with the rocket blasting off from the moons surface.

"75","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052104/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","We open with a long shot of a rocket awaiting launch. Captain Neal Patterson (Eric Fleming), Lt. Mike Cruze (Dave Willock) and Lt. Larry Turner (Patrick Waltz) wait outside the Colonel's office. When admitted they are introduced to Professor Konrad (Paul Birch) and told their next assignment is to take Konrad to the Space Station. They express disappointment at such an unimportant assignment, but Col. Ramsey (an uncredited Guy Prescott) cryptically tells them, ""There are indications of serious trouble up there. Professor Konrad will tell you about it when you're underway.""The crew prepares for launch when Konrad arrives. He explains the importance of the Space Station as a launching point for all future space missions. Outside, Larry is saying goodbye to his girlfriend (an uncredited Joi Lansing). With Larry back on board, Prof. Konrad is strapped into his bed for launch. The crew grimaces with the G-forces of acceleration until they reach orbit. They navigate towards the Space Station. Konrad tells Patterson about the true nature of the mission, ""They've made some disturbing observations from the Space Station. Apparently we have some deadly neighbors in outer space. The Earth may be in mortal danger."" At that a ray of energy from an unknown origin flashes across the screen. Multiple shots get closer to the Space Station until one makes a glancing blow. The next shot is a direct hit and the wheel-shaped craft is destroyed. The beams are approaching the spaceship, Starfire. They try to outrun the energy force and are struck. The force accelerates the craft to an incredible speed. Later they will discover the speedometer broken above the maximum pegged value. Capt. Patterson was injured by a piece of flying debris.Title and credits roll [15 minutes into the movie] over a star field. They approach a planet and crash land in the snow. The crew awakens to take stock of their situation. They deduce they are on the planet Venus and discover the air is breathable. Below the snowline they enter a jungle with strange plants and no sound at all. A strange pulsating sound pierces the silence and Prof. Konrad correctly observes, ""My guess is that was an electronic signal of some kind."" They build a camp fire and bed down for the night. Larry takes the first watch. Mike took the watch that brought morning, but he dozed off. As a result, he didn't notice until too late the crew were surrounded by the inhabitants of the area. Women in short shirts, clear plastic high-heel shoes, and carrying ray guns take them hostage. They are marched back to the city. Once inside the city they get the impression that strangers, and particularly male strangers are not welcomed. They are brought into the Council Chamber for an audience with the rulers of Venus.A curtain parts and Queen Yllana (Laurie Mitchell) and her council, all wearing masks, take their seats at a table on a raised platform. Yllana introduces herself, ""I am Yllana, ruler of the city of Kadir and queen of this world."" Next she asks, ""Why are you here?"" Patterson introduces himself and his colleagues, then explains, ""We came from Earth on a peaceful mission, but our ship was thrown off course, and we crashed here."" The Queen does not believe the Earthmen. She and her council adjourn to decide their fate. Motiya (Lisa Davis), the blond woman that Larry found so captivating, leaves to tell Talleah (Zsa Zsa Gabor) of the Earthmen. Talleah, the leader of the resistance movement on Venus, decides to visit the Earthmen and decide for herself if they can be trusted to help her cause. The Earthmen are returned to the Council Chamber to hear the decision. The Queen pronounces that, ""You came here to spy on us, to prepare for invasion. What is the plan of attack? You will die!"" They are returned to the prison quarters.Konrad voices his concern, ""I have a sense of foreboding about them. A feeling of something monstrous, evil."" Patterson adds, ""I'm beginning to think our being here isn't an accident."" He concludes the energy beam originated on Venus. Talleah visits the Earthmen. She tells them their lives are in great danger. She confides that she is one of many who want to overthrow the Queen and makes a deal, ""If you help us, we are going to help you."" Then she drops the bombshell, ""The Earth is going to be destroyed."" Talleah tells of an interplanetary war Venus had ten years earlier with Mordo. Most of the cities were destroyed and lost to the jungle. Yllana led the revolt and took over from the men. Many were killed, but the men she needed are kept on a prison colony moon, Tyrus, that orbits Venus.An escort detail comes to take Capt. Patterson to see the Queen. Konrad noticed the Queen had an interest in Patterson and advises he try to charm her. Betraying her true feeling for Patterson, a jealous Talleah says, ""I hate her! I hate that Queen!"" Yllana joins Patterson in her bed chamber. She tells him, ""Bring me a glass of wine, Captain, and one for yourself."" She sits, provocatively on the edge of the bed, showing a lot of leg. They drink. The charm appears initially to be working until she warns, ""If you do not give us a truthful explanation of your visit here, the Council sentence will be carried out to the letter."" She does provide an escape provision for the handsome Captain. She admits to a desire for him. He asks her to take off her mask, but she refuses. By way of warning, she shows him preparations of the Beta Disintegrator that will be used to destroy the Earth. In a moment of weakness she allows Patterson to unmask her. He is shocked by the visage. Severe radiation burns have left the angry Queen with a scarred face of blue and black skin, with open red sores. ""For that you will die,"" she proclaims. Yllana replaces her mask and calls her guards to escort Patterson back to his cell. When alone, she removes her mask, looks at her face in the mirror and sobs uncontrollably. Patterson explains to his colleagues, ""It was atomic radiation that disfigured her. I think its affected her mind."" The four are taken to see Talleah in her lab. She introduces another of her circle, Kaeel (Barbara Darrow). Talleah tells Patterson they have no time to waste. She has learned that the Queen plans to destroy the Earth in two days. They plan to walk through the jungle to the site of the Beta Disintegrator and destroy it. Before they can leave, the guards search the lab. Since Talleah is still considered loyal she continues to work as the others hide. When the guards leave, Talleah frees her comrades and the Earthmen and they make their way through the city and escape outside.Odeena (Marilyn Buferd), who brought the Earthmen to see Talleah, has been captured and brought before the Queen. She protests her innocence, and is lulled into a sense of safety when the Queen reassures her, ""Odeena has always been loyal to her queen. Release her. You may go."" As she turns to leave, Yllana pulls a ray gun from a guard and blasts her into smoke. Outside the city, Talleah, Patterson and the others are under radar and searchlight detection. They conclude they are safest in a cave. The guards are searching in the jungle for them. Larry leaves the safety of the group to explore the cave system. Larry is observed by something that watches from a rock ledge above him. A giant red-eyed spider pounces down on him. He screams and fights it off. The commotion draws the rest to his aid. A blast with a ray gun soon reduces the spider to a smoldering shadow on the ground. They build a fire and wait in the cave. Patterson, Larry and Mike get to know their female companions on a more intimate basis. Konrad remains unattached, so he volunteers to go gather more wood for the fire. Outside he discovers the search party of guards have found their trail and are closing in fast. They devise a plan to have Talleah pretend to capture and march them back to the city.The Queen oversees final preparations on her Beta Disintegrator. She returns to the city to confront the Earthmen, unaware Talleah is no longer loyal. But Talleah reveals herself, ""I don't want your reward. One move and I kill you."" Patterson orders Yllana to give orders to suspend all work on the Beta Disintegrator. Talleah adds an order of her own, ""You will contact the guards on Tyrus and tell them to free all the men."" Yllana pretends to comply, goes to her bed and pulls a ray gun out from under a pillow, but is quickly disarmed. Patterson pulls her mask off and gives it to Talleah to masquerade as the Queen to give the orders. They tie up the Queen and hide her behind a screen. Motiya and Kaeel leave to warn their partisans at the weapon site. The masked guards enter the Queen's chamber. Talleah orders them out, but Yllana kicks over the screen revealing the plot. Talleah is disarmed and unmasked. The Queen is restored to power. Yllana delays the execution of the traitors until after she destroys the Earth, but promises, ""For her treachery, Talleah will die last, and most horribly of all."" Yllana makes one more appeal to Patterson for his love and attention, but her disfigured face even repells her guards.The Earthmen are taken to the jungle site of the weapon. While Yllana gloats, Motiya and Kaeel signal their mission is completed. On a giant screen the Earth is seen suspended in space. The Queen threatens, ""It took untold millions of years to create the planet you call Earth. Watch it closely Earthmen. It will be destroyed in a matter of seconds. Watch it!"" Yllana presses the button to start the machine. It whirrs up to speed, then makes an unexpected sound of distress. The Queen presses the button again, but all that happens is a screeching sound. She pounds on the button but still nothing happens. The machine explodes and a small fire erupts inside. The Queen enters the main operating room to work it manually. Every lever she throws only makes things worse. More explosions and more fires. A fight between the loyalists and resistance breaks out. A final fireworks display reduces the Queen to a burnt out carcass.Sometime later the Earthmen and citizens of the city assemble in the Council Chambers. A new Queen, Talleah, and her court assume their places on the dais. Talleah announces that the ship has been repaired and the Earthmen can now leave for home. They prepare to depart, but are delayed by a message for the Queen, ""The electronic tele-viewer is working. Earth answers us."" Colonel Ramsey tells the crew that their orders are, ""Not to attempt a return flight in the Starfire. I will not risk his life or the lives of his men in a patched-up ship. Therefore, Captain, you and your crew will remain on the planet Venus until a relief expedition can reach you."" We close with Patterson and Talleah embracing, then each principle cast member gets a credit and close-up.","

One of them, Professor Konrad, determines they have landed on Venus, a planet scientists had believed to be uninhabitable. They are taken prisoner by the inhabitants, all beautiful women, who imprisoned the men and took control of the planet. Their masked Queen, Yllana, has plans to destroy the Earth with their beta disintegrator but there is dissent among them led by the beautiful Talleah.

Yllana makes one more appeal to Patterson for his love and attention, but her disfigured face even repells her guards.The Earthmen are taken to the jungle site of the weapon. While Yllana gloats, Motiya and Kaeel signal their mission is completed. On a giant screen the Earth is seen suspended in space. The Queen threatens, ""It took untold millions of years to create the planet you call Earth. Watch it closely Earthmen. It will be destroyed in a matter of seconds. Watch it!"" Yllana presses the button to start the machine. It whirrs up to speed, then makes an unexpected sound of distress. The Queen presses the button again, but all that happens is a screeching sound. She pounds on the button but still nothing happens. The machine explodes and a small fire erupts inside. The Queen enters the main operating room to work it manually. Every lever she throws only makes things worse. More explosions and more fires. A fight between the loyalists and resistance breaks out. A final fireworks display reduces the Queen to a burnt out carcass.Sometime later the Earthmen and citizens of the city assemble in the Council Chambers. A new Queen, Talleah, and her court assume their places on the dais. Talleah announces that the ship has been repaired and the Earthmen can now leave for home. They prepare to depart, but are delayed by a message for the Queen, ""The electronic tele-viewer is working. Earth answers us."" Colonel Ramsey tells the crew that their orders are, ""Not to attempt a return flight in the Starfire. I will not risk his life or the lives of his men in a patched-up ship. Therefore, Captain, you and your crew will remain on the planet Venus until a relief expedition can reach you."" We close with Patterson and Talleah embracing, then each principle cast member gets a credit and close-up.

As Horace won't give them a day off, Cornelius and Barnaby plot to close the store and sneak into New York for the day, their mission to meet and kiss a girl. In New York, Cornelius spots Irene Molloy, a young female milliner upon who he sets his sights. On their meeting, Cornelius is unaware that she is also one of Horace's possible brides. Beyond what happens between Horace, Cornelius and Irene, Dolly herself may be ready for matrimony again despite her words to the contrary.

                    During World War II, tug boats conduct what are called salvage missions - picking up disabled ships. Not well equipped with weaponry, the tugs are sitting ducks for enemy fire. As such, the crew working the tugs have precarious lives, many with deep seated emotional problems. Before the Americans join the war, ex-American military man David Ross is assigned to captain a tug for the British military. He is shown the ropes by an old friend, Captain Chris Ford. Chris currently shares a flat with a young beautiful Italian-Swiss woman named Stella, who came with the flat and who lives a reclusive life there. Chris is the latest in a long line of tug boat captains who have lived there, each who has found another person to take over the flat and the associated looking after of Stella if anything is to happen to him. That person is given a key to the flat, the key only to be used if needed. The first in the series was Phillip Westerby, to who Stella was to be married before Phillip was killed. Chris, who in turn now loves Stella himself and wants to marry her, asks David to be the next in line. David reluctantly agrees. As David learns the pressures associated with his work, he begins also to understand the emotional turmoil that Stella has gone through, which changes his opinion about ""the key"". Stella's view of the key also changes with David.

Jeanne travels frequently to the house of her childhood friend Maggy Thiebaut-Leroy in Paris to meet her lover, the famous polo player Raoul Flores. One day, Henri suspects of the frequent trips of Jeanne to Paris and invites Maggy and Raoul Flores to have dinner and spend the weekend in his mansion.

                    Henri and Jeanne Tournier, married now for eight years, live outside the provincial town of Dijon, where Jeanne grew up, with their adolescent daughter, Catherine. Jeanne feels like a neglected wife as Henri spends more time on his job as the publisher of the Burgundy Monitor newspaper than he does with her. As such, she feels jealous of the exciting cosmopolitan life of her longtime best friend, married Maggy Thiebaut-Leroy, a flighty Paris socialite. Jeanne's visits to Paris become more and more frequent, to a point of being twice a month, as she has taken up with a renowned Paris polo player, Raoul Florès. Jeanne considers Raoul somewhat reckless in how open he is in their affair, she using Maggy, through who Jeanne and Raoul met, as their third in any outing to avoid any speculation of her infidelity. Jeanne admits she doesn't like the fact of other women chasing after Raoul when she's not around, he stating that he never succumbs to their advances. Jeanne suspects that Henri is having his own affair, with Hélène Cavalier, his secretary at the newspaper. Regardless of if Henri's affair is fact or just Jeanne's belief, Henri, knowing about Raoul, wants to have a showdown of sorts by Jeanne asking both Maggy and Raoul for a weekend in Dijon with them. If Jeanne has nothing to hide, she should have no problem with inviting her friends. That showdown, where the three in the triangle plan to work toward their own end goals, is affected by the last minute addition of a fifth to the weekend, young archaeologist Bernard Dubois-Lambert, who rescues Jeanne from her broken down car en route from Paris back to Dijon and who abhors the vacuous life of the Paris social scene.

                    In an effort to relieve the suffering of surgery patients, Dr. Thomas Bolton painstakingly develops an opium-based anesthetic, to which he gradually becomes addicted. In order to provide a continual supply of chemicals to continue his experiments and support his addiction, he falls in with a den of murderers who use his signature to sell cadavers to the local hospital.

                    In 1840, distinguished surgeon Thomas Bolton is convinced there must be a way to undertake painless surgery. He is a caring man and even runs a free clinic for the poor and underprivileged. He is particularly concerned about patients who are operated on without the benefit of anesthetic. His experiments lead him to the discovery of nitrous oxide but his first attempt at a demonstration to his colleagues goes very very wrong. He is also experimenting on himself, which affects his health and his surgical abilities. When he is banned from the hospital, he turns to a tavern keeper for help in getting the chemicals he needs to continue his experiments. In return, he is forced to help them by providing false death certificates from which they make a pretty penny murdering people and selling the bodies to the hospital. The police are soon on to them.

A narrator tells us, ""In the beginning there was chaos and eternal night. And a voice said, 'let there be light' and the dark was separated from the night. There was created the waters and the land and there were made the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night, and the stars to give light to the darkness. The Earth was made to bear growing green things and fruit. The animals were created and they were fruitful and multiplied. And then there came man."" A torch burns on a cave wall. Title and credits follow.The Curly-Haired Boy (Jonathan Haze) calls to the other tribe members carrying a dead elk back to the village (Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park, Los Angeles, CA). The Symbol Maker's wife (June Jocelyn) talks to her husband, the Symbol Maker (Leslie Bradley). He asks, ""Where is the boy?"" The wife mimes, beyond the river. The Symbol Maker's Teenage Son (Robert Vaughn) leans against a tree holding a spear. His father approaches. The father reminds his son of the law. The son admits he did go beyond the river, but only a little way. He argues that the area is plentiful with game, but his father tells him it is forbidden. The Symbol Maker tells his son it is a place of sickness and death. The Symbol Maker admits that he once visited the forbidden area, but only once. He warns of a creature known as The God that Gives Death with its Touch. The Symbol Maker tells his son it is time to return to the village.The Black-Bearded One (Frank DeKova) tells the Blond Maiden (Darah Marshall) that the Symbol Maker's Son will not reach the rights of manhood. There is a growing antagonism between The Black-Beaded One and the Symbol Maker's Son. Three men sit in the center of the village. The Symbol Maker's Son asks the first, ""Why do you do what you do?"" The Tender of Fire (Robert Shayne) answers, ""It's the first of the three great gifts of man."" The Symbol Maker's Son asks the second man, ""What good is it to worship a thing that turns?"" The Turner of Wheel (Joseph Hamilton) replies, ""It is the second of the great gifts of man.""

The Black-Bearded One has an agenda, and it involves taunting then tempting the Symbol Maker's Son to violate the law.That evening the Elder Keeper of the Law (Charles P. Thompson) announces that before the hunt two symbol makers are the glory and the life. Their power is to insure a good hunt. They have the power to see visions. The Symbol Maker reminds his son that it is against the law to question the signs and gifts of the gods. The son asks his father what the God that Gives Death with its Touch looks like. After the signs are made, the male tribe members venture off to hunt. The Symbol Maker is attacked and injured by a bear. The hunters return to camp carrying the bear, and the Symbol Maker on a stretcher. The Elder Keeper of the Law tends the Symbol Maker's wounds. The Black-Bearded One again tells the Symbol Maker's Son that one brave man could supply enough food for many days. He then limps over to the Tender of Fire. He asks, ""What is the punishment for questioning the law?"" The reply is that he be shunned for a time, but if evil comes to the village, then death is the prescribed penalty.The Curly-Haired Boy practices his fighting skills with the Fair-Haired Boy (Beach Dickerson) and wins. He hands the spear to the Symbol Maker's Son. The Symbol Maker's Son tells his clan members that the meat won't last long so another hunt must be arranged. He tells them that just beyond the river there is plenty of meat. The tribe members are horrified by the concept of breaking the law and walk away. They remind the Symbol Maker's Son of the dangers. At first light, the Symbol Maker's Son and three young clan members venture to the river, then beyond. They encounter two large lizards and watch them battle each other. The Fair-Haired Boy falls into quicksand, and despite the others' best efforts, he sinks to his death. Two boys return to the village but the Symbol Maker's Son continues the hunt alone. He sees more strange animals. He builds a fire and cooks a small game animal for dinner. A large, hairy, ape-like creature approaches the Symbol Maker's Son and his fire. It has large hemispherical eyes and a trunk like an elephant. The Symbol Maker's Son runs away from the creature, and hits his head on a tree and is knocked unconscious.In the village, the Elder Keeper of the Law announces, ""The blood is clean. The Symbol Maker wakes. He asks after his son."" The Symbol Maker asks his wife to fetch his son, but she informs him the boy is not in the village, but beyond the river. The Black-Bearded One confronts the Symbol Maker. He warns him that death will be visited upon the tribe. The Symbol Maker vows to go retrieve his sun in three days.The Symbol Maker's Son finally wakes and gets an idea. He fashions a primitive bow and arrow. With it he kills a deer. The Symbol Maker leaves camp. The Symbol Maker's Son carries the deer back to camp. A pack of dogs follows him. They get his deer and attack him. The Symbol Maker sees the attack and assists his son, killing the dog. Symbol Maker and son return to the village. The Black-Bearded One talks to the clan. He demands the Symbol Maker's Son be punished with death. The Symbol Maker, speaking for the defense, reminds the clan that everyone has questioned the law. He stipulates the law was broken, but since no evil has presented itself, he recommends shunning. Over strong objections by the Black-Bearded One, the Elder Keeper of the Law decrees the punishment of shunning. The Black-Bearded One is incensed and tries to take the law into his own hands and attacks the boy. The Elder Keeper of the Law breaks up the fight with a strong word.The Blond Maiden goes for a bath. The Symbol Makers Son entertains her with his pan pipes. She is amused, and contrary to the law, she speaks to him. She reminds him to abide by the law. A man on horseback wanders into the village. The Black-Bearded One wants it killed. The Symbol Makers Son proclaims the creature is just a man on an animal. The Man from the Burning Plains falls off and the horse rides away. The Symbol Makers son tries to protect the bearded stranger, but BB kills the stranger after he utters but one word, Peace.A tribal elder meeting is called. The Symbol Maker speaks of other clans and the need for contact. The Black-Bearded One argues against such contact. In addition he demands the position of Symbol Maker. The Symbol Maker is removed from his position and the Black-Bearded One is made the new symbol maker. A ceremony is held for the Symbol Maker's Son--entrance into manhood. The Symbol Maker's Son agrees to hold to the word and to the law. Part of the ceremony is the revealing of ancient symbols left by the gods. One is a meteor. The Black-Bearded One again antagonizes the Symbol Maker's Son. The Symbol Maker's Son warns the Black-Bearded One to stay in front of him when they go to the cave to make symbols. He foresees one dead by the other's hand. The Symbol Maker's Son and the Blond Maiden engage in conversation. She suggests a place of their own higher up on the mountain. He tells his woman he still dreams of the forbidden area. He reveals his goal is to seek the God that Gives Death with its Touch. He prepares for the journey. The Blond Maiden goes to see the former Symbol Maker and tells him his son has gone beyond the river. Father intends to go after his son. As he departs, the Black-Bearded one stirs up trouble with the clan. The men of the clan go after father and son. They want to prevent evil from coming to their village.The Black-Bearded One tells the men to cross the river, but the Blond Tribe Member (Ed Nelson) questions the orders. The Black-Bearded One crosses the river and promises that the journey is righteous and that no harm will come to the clan. The men do follow. The dogs catch the scent of the men. The Symbol Maker's Son finds the God he seeks and aims his bow and arrow at the creature. The clan reaches the former Symbol Maker and his son just as the dogs attack. Both the Blond Tribe Member and the Curly-Haired Boy are attacked. The Black-Bearded One climbs to a higher vantage and throws a rock on the hairy creature. Incensed, the Symbol Maker's Son shoots his arrow and kills the Black-Bearded One. The Symbol Maker's Son cautiously approaches the creature and pulls the head off. Underneath is a very old man with white hair and a white beard. He searches the body and finds a book. He opens the book and shows his father pictures: two men shaking hands, pictures of the New York skyline, and the explosion of the atomic bomb. The clan leaves the body and returns to their village.

The opening scene is the Main Street of a small town and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly (Charles Bronson) wearing coveralls and a hat. He is carrying a musical instrument case and walking towards a bank. He sees the word ""Funeral"" in a store window, winces, and turns away to light his cigarette. Anything associated with death or dying upsets him. He enters the back seat of a stolen car driven by two men. The three men drive to the Lebanon bank. They enter and rob the bank. The driver, Maize (Wally Compo) and passenger, Howard (Jack Lambert) assist Kelly with their elaborately planned and timed robbery. They discard their clothes and weapons and the loot is passed to a fourth man, Michael ""Fanny"" Fandango (Morey Amsterdam). Kelly exits the getaway car and meets up with a waiting Florence ""Flo"" Becker (Susan Cabot) in her car.A couple are stopped at a police road block and wait their turn for questioning. Harriet (Mitzi McCall) and Teddy (uncredited) are asked about a car and three men. Harriet is a little confused, and they are allowed on their way. Flo and Kelly drive up and wait for questioning. Flo is cautious but unconcerned. Kelly is angry and resentful and his attitude raises suspicion. A police call informs the roadblock officers that the car they are looking for has been found, abandoned. Before things escalate between Kelly and the police they are sent on their way.Kelly and Flo stop at a gas station along the road. They chat with an accomplice, Harry (Frank DeKova). Harry has a drinking problem, a character weakness Kelly exploits. Harry collects animals for his roadside zoo. He has a mountain lion he claims he captured himself, with a little help. Harry demands his $200 fee for his part in the robbery, but Kelly is reluctant to pay him. An encounter with Harry's cat convinces him otherwise. Harry gets his money, but also a beating for the way he convinced Kelly to pay. In addition, he gets a healthy scratch from his pet.The headlines in the local newspaper claim that $41,000 was taken. Flo loves to flirt, because she likes men, and she knows it annoys Kelly. The gang reassembles at a hotel room and waits for Fanny, a nickname Fandango really dislikes, to arrive with the money. When he does finally show he is short about $5,000. Fanny was holding out and they find it in his money belt. At police headquarters, Detectives Clinton (Michael Fox) and Drummond (Larry Thor) meet with a witness to go over mug books. At the hideout, Howard annoys Kelly with a jade figurine of death. He also knows that any mention of death sets Kelly off. The gang is getting a little stir crazy. Flo returns from casing a bank for their next job. Flo informs Kelly that Fandango plans to avenge himself for his rough treatment by Kelly. Kelly meets with Fanny at Harry's gas station. After a brief chat, Kelly pushes Fanny against the mountain lion's cage. His arm is mauled and will be amputated later.The gang reviews their plans for the bank robbery. An armored car with a large construction payroll delivery is planned, and they intend to intercept it. Flo will block traffic with her car as the others rob the bank. Howard enters the bank and will use a bathroom break as a pretense to get near the vault. Kelly walks towards the bank. The delivery of a coffin to a local funeral parlor spooks him and he retreats unable to complete his part of the robbery. The vault guard notices Howard and a gun fight ensues. The bank manager is killed and the guard chases Howard out of the bank. Kelly finally arrives at the bank but it is too late and he flees. Howard and Maize drive off with Joe (uncredited) and his driver in hot pursuit. They were supposed to pick up the construction payroll. They stopped earlier to assist Flo with her ""inoperable"" car. In the hail of bullets, one manages to hit Maize and he loses control of the getaway car and crashes. Howard escapes on foot with a non-lethal bullet wound. Kelly and Flo hide out at Flo's mom's house.Ma Becker (Connie Gilchrist) greets her daughter, Flo, and takes an instant dislike to Kelly. She tells her daughter, ""You never could pick your men, could you?"" Flo's mom is a Madame and runs a house of prostitution. She has five girls working for her, including Martha (Shirley Falls). Kelly and Flo sit down for a meal and we meet her Dad, Frank (George Archambeault). Frank gives Kelly a drink and talks. When Kelly sees a tattoo of a skull and crossed bones on Frank's hand he immediately shuns Flo's father. Mrs. Becker just loves to needle Kelly and remind her daughter that she isn't a very good judge of men, even crooked ones.Flo stops at a bar and is noticed by Philip Ashton (Jay Sayer). He was waiting for her, and invites himself to join her at her table for a drink and a chat. He explains that he is, ""A friend of Michael's...you call him Fandango, I believe."" He informs Flo that Howard blames Kelly for the botched bank job and he intends to kill him. Ashton also informs Flo that Fandango lost his arm. He closes with a warning that Howard and his new gang wants Kelly out of the bank robbery business.At the house, the girls are entertaining Kelly. Martha has taken a real shine to Kelly. When Flo gets back to the house she expresses her disapproval. She slaps Kelly and gets slapped in return as she is explaining that Howard intends to kill Kelly. Flo reminds Kelly that the botched job was Kelly's fault, but she helps him locate Howard and his new gang. Mrs. Becker continues to needle Kelly after which he visits Howard and his new gang and kills them all while they are playing poker. Kelly decides there isn't enough profit in bank robbery and decides more money can be made with kidnap for ransom.Flo and Kelly wait in their car outside a school to intercept a little girl. Sheryl Vito (Lori Martin as Dawn Menzer) is the last to exit the school. The kidnappers talk to the little girl while she looks for and waits on her nurse/governess, Lynn Grayson (Barboura Morris) who happens along just as the girl is abducted. Since the ransom note is already being delivered, Flo's suggestion to abandon the plan is overruled. They decide to kidnap both. While Flo escorts the girl into the car, Kelly pulls a gun on Lynn and coerces the nurse into the car. They drive off and meet up with another accomplice, Apple (Richard Devon). All but Flo leave in Apple's car. Flo goes home to pick up clothes and supplies. The gang holes up in a house in the country. Kelly explains the rules to Lynn, and under duress Lynn cooperates fully. A radio broadcast reports Lynn as being an accomplice in the kidnapping, as this was her first day on the job.

    Synopsis
    We open with the title and credits over newspaper headlines and gun images and a jazz score. The opening scene is the Main Street of a small town and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly (Charles Bronson) wearing coveralls and a hat. He is carrying a musical instrument case and walking towards a bank. He sees the word ""Funeral"" in a store window, winces, and turns away to light his cigarette. Anything associated with death or dying upsets him. He enters the back seat of a stolen car driven by two men. The three men drive to the Lebanon bank. They enter and rob the bank. The driver, Maize (Wally Compo) and passenger, Howard (Jack Lambert) assist Kelly with their elaborately planned and timed robbery. They discard their clothes and weapons and the loot is passed to a fourth man, Michael ""Fanny"" Fandango (Morey Amsterdam). Kelly exits the getaway car and meets up with a waiting Florence ""Flo"" Becker (Susan Cabot) in her car.A couple are stopped at a police road block and wait their turn for questioning. Harriet (Mitzi McCall) and Teddy (uncredited) are asked about a car and three men. Harriet is a little confused, and they are allowed on their way. Flo and Kelly drive up and wait for questioning. Flo is cautious but unconcerned. Kelly is angry and resentful and his attitude raises suspicion. A police call informs the roadblock officers that the car they are looking for has been found, abandoned. Before things escalate between Kelly and the police they are sent on their way.Kelly and Flo stop at a gas station along the road. They chat with an accomplice, Harry (Frank DeKova). Harry has a drinking problem, a character weakness Kelly exploits. Harry collects animals for his roadside zoo. He has a mountain lion he claims he captured himself, with a little help. Harry demands his $200 fee for his part in the robbery, but Kelly is reluctant to pay him. An encounter with Harry's cat convinces him otherwise. Harry gets his money, but also a beating for the way he convinced Kelly to pay. In addition, he gets a healthy scratch from his pet.The headlines in the local newspaper claim that $41,000 was taken. Flo loves to flirt, because she likes men, and she knows it annoys Kelly. The gang reassembles at a hotel room and waits for Fanny, a nickname Fandango really dislikes, to arrive with the money. When he does finally show he is short about $5,000. Fanny was holding out and they find it in his money belt. At police headquarters, Detectives Clinton (Michael Fox) and Drummond (Larry Thor) meet with a witness to go over mug books. At the hideout, Howard annoys Kelly with a jade figurine of death. He also knows that any mention of death sets Kelly off. The gang is getting a little stir crazy. Flo returns from casing a bank for their next job. Flo informs Kelly that Fandango plans to avenge himself for his rough treatment by Kelly. Kelly meets with Fanny at Harry's gas station. After a brief chat, Kelly pushes Fanny against the mountain lion's cage. His arm is mauled and will be amputated later.The gang reviews their plans for the bank robbery. An armored car with a large construction payroll delivery is planned, and they intend to intercept it. Flo will block traffic with her car as the others rob the bank. Howard enters the bank and will use a bathroom break as a pretense to get near the vault. Kelly walks towards the bank. The delivery of a coffin to a local funeral parlor spooks him and he retreats unable to complete his part of the robbery. The vault guard notices Howard and a gun fight ensues. The bank manager is killed and the guard chases Howard out of the bank. Kelly finally arrives at the bank but it is too late and he flees. Howard and Maize drive off with Joe (uncredited) and his driver in hot pursuit. They were supposed to pick up the construction payroll. They stopped earlier to assist Flo with her ""inoperable"" car. In the hail of bullets, one manages to hit Maize and he loses control of the getaway car and crashes. Howard escapes on foot with a non-lethal bullet wound. Kelly and Flo hide out at Flo's mom's house.Ma Becker (Connie Gilchrist) greets her daughter, Flo, and takes an instant dislike to Kelly. She tells her daughter, ""You never could pick your men, could you?"" Flo's mom is a Madame and runs a house of prostitution. She has five girls working for her, including Martha (Shirley Falls). Kelly and Flo sit down for a meal and we meet her Dad, Frank (George Archambeault). Frank gives Kelly a drink and talks. When Kelly sees a tattoo of a skull and crossed bones on Frank's hand he immediately shuns Flo's father. Mrs. Becker just loves to needle Kelly and remind her daughter that she isn't a very good judge of men, even crooked ones.Flo stops at a bar and is noticed by Philip Ashton (Jay Sayer). He was waiting for her, and invites himself to join her at her table for a drink and a chat. He explains that he is, ""A friend of Michael's...you call him Fandango, I believe."" He informs Flo that Howard blames Kelly for the botched bank job and he intends to kill him. Ashton also informs Flo that Fandango lost his arm. He closes with a warning that Howard and his new gang wants Kelly out of the bank robbery business.At the house, the girls are entertaining Kelly. Martha has taken a real shine to Kelly. When Flo gets back to the house she expresses her disapproval. She slaps Kelly and gets slapped in return as she is explaining that Howard intends to kill Kelly. Flo reminds Kelly that the botched job was Kelly's fault, but she helps him locate Howard and his new gang. Mrs. Becker continues to needle Kelly after which he visits Howard and his new gang and kills them all while they are playing poker. Kelly decides there isn't enough profit in bank robbery and decides more money can be made with kidnap for ransom.Flo and Kelly wait in their car outside a school to intercept a little girl. Sheryl Vito (Lori Martin as Dawn Menzer) is the last to exit the school. The kidnappers talk to the little girl while she looks for and waits on her nurse/governess, Lynn Grayson (Barboura Morris) who happens along just as the girl is abducted. Since the ransom note is already being delivered, Flo's suggestion to abandon the plan is overruled. They decide to kidnap both. While Flo escorts the girl into the car, Kelly pulls a gun on Lynn and coerces the nurse into the car. They drive off and meet up with another accomplice, Apple (Richard Devon). All but Flo leave in Apple's car. Flo goes home to pick up clothes and supplies. The gang holes up in a house in the country. Kelly explains the rules to Lynn, and under duress Lynn cooperates fully. A radio broadcast reports Lynn as being an accomplice in the kidnapping, as this was her first day on the job. Also reported is the fact that a ransom note was delivered to Mr. Andrew Vito (Robert Griffin), but no details were released.Flo arrives with her mom and dad in tow. Kelly is upset, as he doesn't like Flo's parents, but Mrs. Becker explains that, ""The child is probably cold, frightened, and hungry, and I'm not leaving until I see that she's all right.""

This is the story of one confronted by such strange forces within himself."" Robert Kraft (Richard Boone) and the caretaker, Andy McKee (Theodore Bikel) walk to the Immortal Hills Cemetary office building. Bob Kraft has taken over the chairmanship of the cemetery and is briefed on the routine by Andy. Bob notices a map on the wall of the cemetery. Andy explains that a black pin on a plot indicates someone buried and a white pin indicates a sold plot not yet occupied. Bob asks Andy, ""McKee you've been on the job now forty years, right?"" Andy replies, ""Aye,"" in his Scottish accent. Bob informs him he is to be retired and assures him he will draw the same monthly paycheck. Bob asks Andy for a replacement recommendation. Andy walks over to the desk and pulls a gun. He tells Bob it is available in case of emergencies. A young couple drive up to the office. It is Stuart Drexel (and uncredited Glen Vernon) and his new bride Elizabeth (an uncredited Lynette Bernay). A provision in Stu's inheritance is that he buy a plot for him and his wife before he can draw part of his trust from the bank. Beth is not amused by the entire situation and lets her new husband know. They drive off and Bob goes back to the office. Upon his return, Andy greets him with a shot of liquor. He explains that the previous chairman left it to sooth customers needing fortification to get through the burial process of a loved one. Bob places two pins on plots in the Drexel area of the cemetery.In his Department Store office, Bob, his Uncle George Kraft (Howard Smith) and the outgoing chairman, Henry Trowbridge (an uncredited Russ Bender) go through the formal process of swearing in Bob Kraft as the new chairman. Bob is not happy with the ""honor"", claiming he is far too busy to take on the role. But Uncle George insists, explaining that it is a family and company tradition and that it is his turn. While it is done pro bono, it is expected because three previous generations of Krafts did. It only entails a few hours a month of work. The caretaker takes care of day to day operations. As soon as he is sworn in he gets a telephone call from the local undertaker. He is told that Stu Drexel and his new bride, Beth, are dead.At the cemetery office, Bob and Andy are going over some paper work when the local newspaper reporter, Jess Jessup (Herbert Anderson) walks in. He tells Bob and Andy he is on the obituary detail, and complains the office is cold. When Bob tells Andy to change the Drexel pins from white to black, Andy informs Bob that they are already black. Bob dismisses it saying, ""I must have picked up the wrong color,"" when he marked the plots. Bob mentions the mistake made him feel eerie. Andy adds, ""I think he means he marked the young couple for death, sir."" Jess jokes that if any more pins are used to stay away from his area of the cemetery. As Jeff leaves, Bob's fiancée, Ann Craig (Peggy Maurer) arrives. She lightly complains that she was stood up for their lunch date. Bob and Ann quickly make up. Bob goes back to the map and randomly places a black pin on a plot. He looks to see his choice. A black and white pin sits on the ""W. Isham"" plot. He pulls the white pin out. The phone rings and he informs the caller that the funeral is for immediate family only. Ann returns to the office and they embrace and kiss. They leave the cemetery office.William Isham (an uncredited Cyril Delevanti) is repairing a teddy bear in his shop. He finishes stitching a section. As he is installing the eyes he collapses and dies. At the cemetery, Andy is finishing the Drexel marble headstone. Bob asks Andy if he has found his replacement. No is the reply, but Andy does show some progress in another area. He has fixed the space heater. Bob reviews the paperwork and notices an invoice for the funeral of William Isham. The pair walk over to the map and Andy tells Bob that he was going to change the white pin to black, but noticed it was already black. Bob tells Andy he changed the pin. Bob calls Jessup at the newspaper office. He informs Andy he change the pin color before the man died. Jessup reassures Bob that there is nothing supernatural. It was just a coincidence.Uncle George and Bob are going over store figures when Bob blurts out that he is quitting the chairmanship. ""I'm going to call Bates, Honegger and Trowbridge right now and tell them I'm quitting."" He reminds his uncle that three incorrectly placed pins accounted for three deaths. Uncle George laughs out loud. He tells Bob he is going out to the cemetery to put some black pins on the map to wipe out the competition. The two drive out together. At the cemetery, George pulls out Henry Trowbridge's pin. Bob insists he actually make the exchange then places a black pin on the map. Bob has a shot of booze and the two depart.Later that evening, Bob calls Henry Trowbridge at home. His wife answers the phone. It is 11:40 p.m. and Henry's wife informs Bob that her husband is not breathing. The body count is now four. The police drive up to the cemetery office. Lt. Clayborne (Robert Osterich) talks to Bob. Incredulous, Clayborne summarizes the situation, ""Let me get this straight, Mr. Kraft. You say that every time you stick a black pin in the map, people turn up dead?"" Clayborne reminds Bob that the Drexel couple were killed in a traffic collision. Isham died of a cerebral hemorrhage and Henry Trowbridge had a coronary thrombosis. He investigated and found nothing to suggest foul play. Bob starts to think it isn't the map, but he may be responsible.At his store office, Bob is informed by his Uncle George that he needs a vacation and George arranges one. Bob asks the committee be assembled that night at 7:00 p.m. Ann tries to reassure Bob it is a coincidence and suggests the vacation be turned into a honeymoon. That evening the committee members meet in Bob's office. Bill Honegger (an uncredited Ken Drake) and Charlie Bates (an uncredited Matt Moore) join Uncle George and Bob Kraft. Bill has a proposal to keep Bob as chairman. The committee demands Bob go out to the cemetery that evening and change Bill, Charlie, and Uncle George's white pins to black, then go home to bed. The motion is passed, and Bob makes the changes as ordered. Andy McKee stops by the cemetery office and tells Bob to lock the office and never come back. The phone rings. It is Jess, and Bob informs him of the three exchanged pins. He tells Jess if anything happens to any of them it is his fault. His attempt to light the portable furnace is unsuccessful. He calls the police and asks for Lt. Clayborne. The Desk Sergeant gives him the number where he can reach him, but the number is always busy. He finally realizes the phone number he has been dialing is Bill Honegger's. Jess calls Bob and informs him that Clayborne is with him and that Honegger is dead. He adds that Charlie Bates was found in his apartment dead. Bob is worried about his Uncle George and is surprised when George walks into the cemetery office. George tells Bob that he has proved his point. George pulls his black pin out of the map then leaves the office. Bob calls the police and asks that a policeman be assigned to watch his uncle.Clayborne calls Bob to inform him that George can't be found. Bob exits the office and finds his uncle in his car, still on the cemetery grounds. He is dead. He drives back to the office. He informs Lt. Clayborne he found his uncle. He puts the black pin back on the map on his Uncle's plot.The next day Lt. Clayborne returns to the cemetery with Jess and Ann in tow. Clayborne asks about one Jacob Mittel. Bob tells the policeman that he is a buyer for the store and he is currently out of the country on business. At the insistence of Clayborne, Bob puts a black pin on his plot. He is informed that Mittel is not dead. He is in Paris. This is a test. The police are setting up a trap. Bob voices his objections. Clayborne suggests Bob may have some unknown power, like voodoo in the West Indies.Overworked and overtired, Bob begins to hallucinate. He blames himself for the deaths. He concludes that if he changes the black pins back to white he can return the dead to life. With the floor heater broken by his own hand, he gathers paper and kindling to light a fire on the floor to keep warm. Out in the cemetery, the graves of the recently departed are starting to unearth themselves. Bob discovers this after he awakens in the smoke filled office. He snags his overcoat on one of the headstones. Leaving it behind, he runs back to the office. He retrieves the gun from the overturned desk. Before he has a chance to commit suicide the phone rings. It is the voice of Mrs. Mittel. She tells Bob that a cable arrived informing her that her husband died in Paris, France. Andy walks in and tells Bob it must be impossible. Andy confesses to Bob that he was responsible for the deaths. Andy was upset at being dismissed after forty years of faithful service. Andy picks up the gun and explains exactly how he killed each one. Andy doesn't believe Jacob Mittel is dead. The police burst into the office after Andy drops dead. Clayborne explains that Jacob Mittel is actually alive. The call and cable were set up by the police with the assistance of Mrs. Mittel. They watched as Andy dug up all seven graves. Bob and Ann leave the cemetery office together. We close with a slow zoom in on the map. It falls off the wall.","

That evening the committee members meet in Bob's office. Bill Honegger (an uncredited Ken Drake) and Charlie Bates (an uncredited Matt Moore) join Uncle George and Bob Kraft. Bill has a proposal to keep Bob as chairman. The committee demands Bob go out to the cemetery that evening and change Bill, Charlie, and Uncle George's white pins to black, then go home to bed. The motion is passed, and Bob makes the changes as ordered. Andy McKee stops by the cemetery office and tells Bob to lock the office and never come back. The phone rings. It is Jess, and Bob informs him of the three exchanged pins. He tells Jess if anything happens to any of them it is his fault. His attempt to light the portable furnace is unsuccessful. He calls the police and asks for Lt. Clayborne. The Desk Sergeant gives him the number where he can reach him, but the number is always busy. He finally realizes the phone number he has been dialing is Bill Honegger's. Jess calls Bob and informs him that Clayborne is with him and that Honegger is dead. He adds that Charlie Bates was found in his apartment dead. Bob is worried about his Uncle George and is surprised when George walks into the cemetery office. George tells Bob that he has proved his point. George pulls his black pin out of the map then leaves the office. Bob calls the police and asks that a policeman be assigned to watch his uncle.Clayborne calls Bob to inform him that George can't be found. Bob exits the office and finds his uncle in his car, still on the cemetery grounds. He is dead. He drives back to the office. He informs Lt. Clayborne he found his uncle. He puts the black pin back on the map on his Uncle's plot.The next day Lt. Clayborne returns to the cemetery with Jess and Ann in tow. Clayborne asks about one Jacob Mittel. Bob tells the policeman that he is a buyer for the store and he is currently out of the country on business. At the insistence of Clayborne, Bob puts a black pin on his plot. He is informed that Mittel is not dead. He is in Paris. This is a test. The police are setting up a trap. Bob voices his objections. Clayborne suggests Bob may have some unknown power, like voodoo in the West Indies.Overworked and overtired, Bob begins to hallucinate. He blames himself for the deaths. He concludes that if he changes the black pins back to white he can return the dead to life. With the floor heater broken by his own hand, he gathers paper and kindling to light a fire on the floor to keep warm. Out in the cemetery, the graves of the recently departed are starting to unearth themselves. Bob discovers this after he awakens in the smoke filled office. He snags his overcoat on one of the headstones. Leaving it behind, he runs back to the office. He retrieves the gun from the overturned desk. Before he has a chance to commit suicide the phone rings. It is the voice of Mrs. Mittel. She tells Bob that a cable arrived informing her that her husband died in Paris, France. Andy walks in and tells Bob it must be impossible. Andy confesses to Bob that he was responsible for the deaths. Andy was upset at being dismissed after forty years of faithful service. Andy picks up the gun and explains exactly how he killed each one. Andy doesn't believe Jacob Mittel is dead. The police burst into the office after Andy drops dead. Clayborne explains that Jacob Mittel is actually alive. The call and cable were set up by the police with the assistance of Mrs. Mittel. They watched as Andy dug up all seven graves. Bob and Ann leave the cemetery office together. We close with a slow zoom in on the map. It falls off the wall.

His passion - his wife would call it his addiction - is music and he spends a great deal of his fortune on concerts held for the locals in his magnificent music room. His wealth is in decline however. His lands are being eroded by the local river and he pays for the concert he arranges for his son's coming of age party by selling some of the family jewels. When his neighbor Ganguli invites him to a party at his house, Roy decides to one up him and organizes a lavish party for the same day - costing him the last of the jewels. After his wife and son are killed in a storm, Roy becomes something of a recluse, closing up the music room. Now, many years later he decides to have one final concert, spending the last of his money to again outdo - and spite - Ganguli.

His wife's entreaties to control spending are ignored, and the puberty party he throws for his son bring him down to the last few sacks of family jewels.
