                    Jane Eyre is left an orphan and penniless at the age of fourteen. She is adopted by her uncle, who has ample means of providing for her, and who also loves her dearly. Her uncle's kin, however, consider her adoption an intrusion, and do all in their power to prevent her becoming a member of the family. But her uncle insists on her remaining, and during his lifetime, she receives some degree of kindness and consideration. Unfortunately Uncle Reed dies and leaves Jane without a friend in the world. She is sent to an orphan asylum by her unfeeling aunt. Five years later she leaves the asylum to accept the position of governess to Lord Rochester's little niece. The child is the daughter of Rochester's dead brother. Her mother has become insane and is living in Lord Rochester's home, under his protection. Jane is engaged by Lord Rochester's housekeeper during his absence from home, and her first meeting with her employer is both exciting and romantic. She is sitting by the edge of the road reading when Lord Rochester rides up to his ancestral home. The sight of his huge dog, coming upon her suddenly, so startles Jane that she jumps to her feet, causing Lord Rochester's horse to shy and throw it rider. He injures his ankle, and has to be assisted to remount ""the little witch,"" as he calls her, who is the cause of his accident. That same evening in his home, he is surprised to find that ""the little witch"" of his adventure is living in his house as his niece's governess. Jane's rich relations, the Reed family, visit Lord Rochester, and persistently insult and humiliate her by treating her as a servant. Lord Rochester, however, is not blind to her sweetness, nor to the cruelty of her cousin, who is trying to win Lord Rochester's hand and fortune. One evening the maniac escapes from her nurse and sets fire to the room in which Lord Rochester has fallen asleep. He is saved from a horrible death by Jane. When next Jane's haughty aunt and cousins come to call upon Lord Rochester, they are just in time to be introduced to his bride, who is none other than the despised Jane Eyre.

                    King Othon's second wife is the fairest in the land. She owns a magic mirror that tells her she is the most beautiful until the day her daughter-in-law's beauty surpasses her own. The jealous Queen decides that Snow White must die and orders a mercenary to kill the young girl and bring back proof of the deed. The man is moved by the girl's beauty and lets her escape in the forest. Snow White finds refuge at the seven dwarfs' cottage. The mirror tells the Queen the whereabouts of Snow White, so she disguises as a peddler with a basket of laces, finds the girl and strangles her. Fortunately, the dwarfs return in time to revive her. But the Queen comes back with a basket full of poisoned apples. This time, the dwarfs are powerless and place Snow White in a crystal coffin that they leave on a rock in the mountain. A Prince and his escort appears. He removes the it of apple from Snow Whites mouth and brings her back to life. He takes her back to his father's palace.

                    The second wife of King Othon is the fairest lady in the land, and the possessor of a magic mirror which tells her often that her beauty is unrivaled. There comes a day, however, when the mirror tells her that her stepdaughter, Little Snowdrop, excels her in beauty. The jealous queen resolves that Snowdrop must die. She summons a hireling and orders him to destroy the girl, and bring her proof of her death. The servant wanders into the forest to lie in wait for Snowdrop, but when the girl comes strolling through the leafy glades, her beauty and youthful innocence touch his heart, and he tells her to fly into the forest out of her stepmother's reach. He takes her handkerchief, which he afterwards stains with the blood of a pigeon, and gives it to the queen. Snowdrop, left alone, plunges deep into the forest, and at last comes to the house of the Seven Dwarfs. They hospitably receive her, and beg her to stay with them. In the meantime the queen has learned from her mirror that Snowdrop still lives and where she is. She decides to destroy her herself, and, disguising herself as a beggar, she takes a basket of lace, seeks out the unfortunate girl and strangles her with a piece of lace. The Dwarfs return in time to save Snowdrop from death, and the queen, on reaching the palace, learns from her mirror that she still lives. She returns to the Dwarfs' house with a basket of poisoned apples and, Snowdrop, having tasted one, falls unconscious. This time, the skill of the Dwarfs is unavailing. They place her in a crystal coffin among the big boulders on the mountain. Scarcely have they placed the coffin on the ground when a gay cavalcade of mounted men, headed by a noble prince, appears in sight. The Dwarfs disappear, and the Prince, dismounting, approaches the coffin. He lifts the lid and. withdrawing the piece of poisoned apple from Snowdrop's mouth, restores her to life. Then, wondering at her beauty, he hears her story, mounts her before him on his horse, and carries her in triumph to her father's palace, where her return is celebrated with much rejoicing, and to the discomfiture of the wicked queen.

                    The incidents pictured in this film are founded on fact and relate to William Scott, a young soldier from the State of Vermont. Scott is on guard after a heavy day's march, and being found asleep is placed under arrest. He is tried by court-martial and sentenced to death. Meantime we see President Lincoln in his study at the White House in deep thought, and seeing a vision of the Civil War and the sorrow caused by it. The vision disappears and he reads a letter from Mrs. Scott pleading for the pardon of her son. Deeply affected he lays the letter down and sees another vision, that of the gray-haired mother and a nameless grave. We next see being marched off to the spot where he is to be shot. All is in readiness for the fatal word of command to be given, when through a cloud of dust a coach dashes up attended by outriders. The President steps out and pardons the prisoner, who falls on his knees and blesses him. The next scene is that of a battle with the Union soldiers retreating. The color-bearer falls, but William Scott rushes up, grabs the flag and rallies the Union troops, but amid the dreadful carnage he himself is shot. That night the doctors and ambulances are searching among the dead for the wounded who are still alive. They reach Scott. He is dying. A vision of the President appears before him, giving him a wreath of fame. Scott staggers to his feet, and as the vision fades away, drops dead. As a fitting climax, we see a tableau of President Lincoln taking from a Union and a Confederate color-bearer their respective flags, rolling them together and when they are unrolled displaying the Stars and Stripes.

                    Charley Wise with a Waldorf appetite on a beany salary finds himself growing unpopular with his landlord as well as other creditors. In fact the sighing breezes seem to whisper ""Charley it's your move."" So together with Pete, his valet, they decide upon a visit to the country to spend a few days with the rich old uncle. Upon their arrival they find Uncle Jim and Sarah are just planning a trip to Europe and the timely arrival of Charley renders it unnecessary to close up the home as he is placed in full charge with faithful Pete as his assistant and Jim and Sarah are off for the other side. Charles repairs to the race track and donates the remaining fragments of his bank roll, to the other man's better judgment. Pete hits upon a plan to open the palatial home of the uncle as a sanitarium and thus collect a few of the shining shekels that health seekers are always anxious to let loose of. Accordingly an ad is inserted in the daily papers, a sign put over the door, and the rooms are all numbered in regular order, per city hotel fashion. The patients begin to flock in like children to a nickel show. All sorts, ages, sizes, suffering from every known and unknown malady from Reno-it is to raving maniac. Pete was collecting in advance and the place in a few short hours looked more like a castle garden of Blackville Island than a country home. The money was rolling in so fast that Chas. and Pete almost went into hysteria. Just then a telegram arrives from 'Frisco from Uncle Jim saying that Aunt Sarah had lost her necklace and was returning home that night to find it. To clear the house for her coming was no small job and they encounter all kinds of trouble, compelled to return their money, which has a telling effect on Charles' ambitions. No sooner than this part of the program was completed a second message arrives saying the necklace had been found and they were off for Europe. Charles had no time to rejoice over the finding of the pearls; he was too busy thinking about the money he had found necessary to return to his sanitarium patients.

                    The Duchess de Langeais was one of the reigning belles of Paris, the pet of society, the envy of the women and the admiration of all the men. Her many conquests led her to believe herself to be irresistible, and when the famous General de Meyran failed to appreciate her charms, her vanity was piqued, and she determined to not only humble him in her own eyes, but in the eyes of all her friends. She had met him at an assembly at a friend's home, where he seemed to be suffering from ennui. Nothing amused this blasé soldier, the music was poor, the chattering of the ladies was uninteresting, and altogether he seemed to be having a very poor time. So distinguished did he appear that the Duchess desired that he be presented to her. This was done, but the General, instead of seeming pleased, immediately makes his adieus and takes his departure. The character of the General in its calmness and dignity is a distinct contrast to the nature of the frivolous Duchess, and his coldness determines the coquettish young lady to bring him to her feet. In order to do this, she grants him a special favor by inviting him to a tête-à-tête in her own home. The General accepts the invitation and beneath the warm hospitality his indifference melts and he yields to the charm of his hostess. Finally falling at her feet, he is about to profess his love and admiration for her, when the door is opened and the personal friends of the Duchess, whom she has induced to wait for this critical moment in the ante-room, enter, laughing slyly at the General's discomfiture. Deeply wounded and angered, the General takes his departure. After he is gone, the Duchess de Langeais realizes that she, too, has finally fallen deeply in love, but too late. She hastens to the General's office and seeks admittance. This is at first refused, but when she threatens to do herself some injury if he doesn't receive her, the austere soldier consents. When she is admitted, she throws herself at his feet and asks his forgiveness. This he sternly refuses, and immediately thereafter the Duchess disappears from Parisian society. Five years later, General de Meyran receives a commission from Ferdinand VII of Spain, and while establishing order in Formentera he visits the convent of the Order of the Carmelite Nuns. While passing through the chapel, he recognizes in the garb of a nun his former love, the Duchess de Langeais. The recognition is mutual and the Duchess flees to her cell. That night the General, with two friends, resolves to take her by force from the convent, and having forced an entrance they wander along the quiet passage until they find the door marked with the name which the Duchess has adopted at the time of her taking the veil. They enter, alas, too late; the excitement of seeing her love in such a place, after five years of separation, has proved too much for the Duchess, and she has died, and here in the lonely cell they find her body laid upon a rude bier, with a dim light of candles flickering on her pallid face. The Mother Superior now enters and sternly orders them to retire. This they do, after the General has imprinted his first and last kiss on the cold lips of his dead love.

                    Rip Van Winkle, a lazy American man, wanders off one day with his dog Wolf into the Kaatskill mountains where he runs into an odd group of men drinking and playing bowls. He drinks some of their mysterious brew and passes out. When he wakes up under a tree he is astonished to find that 20 years have passed and things are a lot different. This is a charming story about how America changed due to the cival war, only in a different and more subtle way than ever told before.
