"2","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043014/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film opens with the camera tracking down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California as police cars begin racing down it. The lifeless body of a young man, Joe Gillis (Holden) floats in the swimming pool of a palatial mansion. As the police begin converging on the house Joe's voice narrates, in flashback style, the events leading up to his own murder.Six months earlier, Joe was down on his luck, unable to find work as a screenwriter, having only made a few undistinguished films in his short career. Broke and on the verge of having his car repossessed, with no other options except a low-paying newspaper job in Ohio, Joe tries to persuade Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake (Clark) to buy his most recent script, but fails after script reader Betty Schaefer (Olson) gives Sheldrake a harsh critique of the script in her summation. Joe then tries unsuccessfully to borrow money from his friends. Fleeing from repossession men in his car, one of Joe's tires blows out in front of a large and seemingly deserted mansion on Sunset. Hiding the car in the garage, he sets out to explore the decaying house, when a woman inside calls to him. Mistaken for the undertaker to a recently deceased pet chimpanzee, he is ushered in by the mysterious butler, Max Von Mayerling (Von Stroheim). Meeting the woman who owns the house, he recognizes her as long-forgotten silent-film star Norma Desmond (Swanson). When she learns that he is a writer, she invites him in and asks for his opinion on an immense script she has written for a film about Salome that she hopes will revive her faded acting career. Although Joe finds the script awful, he flatters Norma into hiring him as an editor.Joe is put up in her guest room. The next morning he objects when he sees that Max has moved his belongings to the mansion on Norma's orders, and that she has paid his overdue rent. Though he hates being dependent on her, he accepts the situation and begins living at the mansion, first in a room over the garage, then in the mansion itself. As he works on Norma's script, he comes to see how unaware she is of how her fame has died. She refuses to hear any criticism of her work, and makes him watch her old films in the evenings. Although she still receives fan mail, Joe later learns that Max feeds into Norma's fantasy by sending the letters himself. He explains that Norma's state of mind is fragile, and she has attempted suicide in the past.Over the next few weeks, Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothing, including a tuxedo for a private New Year's Eve party attended only by the two of them. Horrified to learn that she has fallen in love with him, he tries to let her down gently, but she slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe, thinking his time with her is over, escapes to a party at his friend, assistant director Artie Green's (Webb) house, where he meets Betty Schaefer again. While still unimpressed with most of his work, she believes a scene in one of his scripts has potential. Joe half-agrees to work on it with her, and calls the house on Sunset to tell Max he is leaving. However, when Max informs him that Norma has attempted suicide with Joe's razor blade, Joe leaves the party and returns to the mansion, where he apologizes to Norma and makes love to her.After a while, Norma considers her script complete, and sends it to Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount and waits for his answer. Not long afterwards, calls from Paramount asking for Norma begin to arrive. They come from an executive named Gordon Cole, and Norma petulantly refuses to speak to anyone other than DeMille himself. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to the studio in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A, a rare vintage luxury car. While DeMille entertains Norma, many of the older guards, technicians and extras on the set recognize her and welcome her back. Joe and Max, meanwhile, learn that Cole had called because the studio wants to rent her car and has no interest in her script (DeMille tells an assistant in private that the script is awful). Max insists that they hide these facts from her. He later confesses to Joe that he was once a respected film director who discovered Norma as a girl, and was also her first husband, and that he now remains as her servant because he cannot bear to leave her.While Norma undergoes a rigorous series of beauty treatments to prepare for her comeback, Joe has secretly begun to work with Betty on a screenplay. Though she is now engaged to Artie, she falls in love with him. Although he likes her, Joe is dismayed at the triangle in which he is now caught. When Norma discovers the script with Betty's name on it, she phones Betty and insinuates what sort of man Joe really is. Joe, hearing her, invites Betty to the mansion to see for herself. When she arrives, he coldly terminates their relationship by letting her believe that he is a gigolo and prefers to live off Norma. After Betty leaves the mansion in tears, Joe begins packing, having decided to return to Ohio. He bluntly informs Norma of the truththat there will be no comeback, her fan letters come from Max, and she is forgotten. He ignores Norma's threats to shoot herself, and in a fit of passion she shoots him as he leaves, leaving him dead in the pool.The scene returns to the opening. Still narrating, Joe expresses fear over how Norma will be unable to cope with the disgrace, and the discovery of how forgotten she truly is. By the time the police arrive, however, she has completely broken with reality and slipped into a delusional state of mind, thinking the news cameras are set up for a film shoot. To help the police coax her down the stairs, Max plays along with her hallucination that she is on the set of her new film. He verbally sets up the scene for her, and yells ""Action!""; Norma dramatically descends her grand staircase. Joe, in voiceover, remarks that life has decided to spare her the pain of that discovery, and that ""The dream she had clung to so desperately had enfolded her."" Norma makes a short speech at how happy she is to be back making a film, and delivers the film's most famous line: ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.""","

Broke and on the verge of having his car repossessed, with no other options except a low-paying newspaper job in Ohio, Joe tries to persuade Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake (Clark) to buy his most recent script, but fails after script reader Betty Schaefer (Olson) gives Sheldrake a harsh critique of the script in her summation. Joe then tries unsuccessfully to borrow money from his friends. Fleeing from repossession men in his car, one of Joe's tires blows out in front of a large and seemingly deserted mansion on Sunset. Hiding the car in the garage, he sets out to explore the decaying house, when a woman inside calls to him. Mistaken for the undertaker to a recently deceased pet chimpanzee, he is ushered in by the mysterious butler, Max Von Mayerling (Von Stroheim). Meeting the woman who owns the house, he recognizes her as long-forgotten silent-film star Norma Desmond (Swanson). When she learns that he is a writer, she invites him in and asks for his opinion on an immense script she has written for a film about Salome that she hopes will revive her faded acting career. Although Joe finds the script awful, he flatters Norma into hiring him as an editor.Joe is put up in her guest room. The next morning he objects when he sees that Max has moved his belongings to the mansion on Norma's orders, and that she has paid his overdue rent. Though he hates being dependent on her, he accepts the situation and begins living at the mansion, first in a room over the garage, then in the mansion itself. As he works on Norma's script, he comes to see how unaware she is of how her fame has died. She refuses to hear any criticism of her work, and makes him watch her old films in the evenings. Although she still receives fan mail, Joe later learns that Max feeds into Norma's fantasy by sending the letters himself. He explains that Norma's state of mind is fragile, and she has attempted suicide in the past.Over the next few weeks, Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothing, including a tuxedo for a private New Year's Eve party attended only by the two of them. Horrified to learn that she has fallen in love with him, he tries to let her down gently, but she slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe, thinking his time with her is over, escapes to a party at his friend, assistant director Artie Green's (Webb) house, where he meets Betty Schaefer again. While still unimpressed with most of his work, she believes a scene in one of his scripts has potential. Joe half-agrees to work on it with her, and calls the house on Sunset to tell Max he is leaving. However, when Max informs him that Norma has attempted suicide with Joe's razor blade, Joe leaves the party and returns to the mansion, where he apologizes to Norma and makes love to her.After a while, Norma considers her script complete, and sends it to Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount and waits for his answer. Not long afterwards, calls from Paramount asking for Norma begin to arrive. They come from an executive named Gordon Cole, and Norma petulantly refuses to speak to anyone other than DeMille himself. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to the studio in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A, a rare vintage luxury car. While DeMille entertains Norma, many of the older guards, technicians and extras on the set recognize her and welcome her back. Joe and Max, meanwhile, learn that Cole had called because the studio wants to rent her car and has no interest in her script (DeMille tells an assistant in private that the script is awful). Max insists that they hide these facts from her. He later confesses to Joe that he was once a respected film director who discovered Norma as a girl, and was also her first husband, and that he now remains as her servant because he cannot bear to leave her.While Norma undergoes a rigorous series of beauty treatments to prepare for her comeback, Joe has secretly begun to work with Betty on a screenplay. Though she is now engaged to Artie, she falls in love with him. Although he likes her, Joe is dismayed at the triangle in which he is now caught. When Norma discovers the script with Betty's name on it, she phones Betty and insinuates what sort of man Joe really is. Joe, hearing her, invites Betty to the mansion to see for herself. When she arrives, he coldly terminates their relationship by letting her believe that he is a gigolo and prefers to live off Norma. After Betty leaves the mansion in tears, Joe begins packing, having decided to return to Ohio. He bluntly informs Norma of the truththat there will be no comeback, her fan letters come from Max, and she is forgotten. He ignores Norma's threats to shoot herself, and in a fit of passion she shoots him as he leaves, leaving him dead in the pool.The scene returns to the opening. Still narrating, Joe expresses fear over how Norma will be unable to cope with the disgrace, and the discovery of how forgotten she truly is. By the time the police arrive, however, she has completely broken with reality and slipped into a delusional state of mind, thinking the news cameras are set up for a film shoot. To help the police coax her down the stairs, Max plays along with her hallucination that she is on the set of her new film. He verbally sets up the scene for her, and yells ""Action!""; Norma dramatically descends her grand staircase. Joe, in voiceover, remarks that life has decided to spare her the pain of that discovery, and that ""The dream she had clung to so desperately had enfolded her."" Norma makes a short speech at how happy she is to be back making a film, and delivers the film's most famous line: ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.""

"4","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Sheltering from a rainstorm in the ruins of the Rashomon gatehouse, a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) sit dejected. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them, and wants to hear the ""strange story"" they have just heard at a murder enquiry in the courthouse garden. The story has horrified the priest. Even though ""year after year, it's been nothing but disasters,"" he has ""never heard a story as horrible as this."" The woodcutter is utterly confounded, and hopes the commoner can help him understand it.The woodcutter begins the narration, telling the commoner that three days earlier he had gone ""into the mountains to get wood.""The woodcutter is walking through the woods, carrying his axe. Sunlight filters through the foliage, dappling everything with a mix of sun and sharp shadows. He sees a woman's hat caught on a bush. Further along, he picks up a samurai's hat and some cut up rope. He sees something small amongst the leaves on the ground, and goes towards it, but does not notice the corpse right in front of him until he trips over it. He screams and, dropping everything (including his axe), runs away. He says, ""I ran as fast as I could to tell the police. Then, three days later--today--I was called to testify.""The woodcutter is seated in the sunlit courthouse garden, addressing the court, unseen and unheard behind the camera. He testifies that he is the one who found the body. Asked if he saw ""a sword or something,"" he protests emphatically that he found ""nothing at all"" but the hats, rope, and ""a shiny amulet case."" And here he lets slip two additional details: the rope was ""near the body"" and the amulet case had ""a red lining.""The priest is seated in the courthouse garden. He testifies that he saw the man three days earlier, travelling on the road with a woman on a horse, and armed with a sword and bow and arrows. [There is a brief shot of the samurai passing on the road, turning to smile at his wife.] The priest comments on the fragility of life and offers condolences to someone off screen--presumably the wife.The policeman (Daisuke Kato) is seated in the courthouse garden. The bandit (Toshiro Mifune) is sitting beside him, bound. The policeman identifies the bandit as the notorious Tajomaru. He had captured him two days earlier, at dusk. [There is a brief shot of the policeman finding the bandit writhing in agony on a riverbank. The bandit pushes him into the river.] He describes the weapons and horse belonging to the samurai. He concludes that Tajomaru must have fallen from the stolen horse.The bandit hotly denies falling from his horse. [There is a brief shot depicting the bandit as he wants to be perceived: galloping in heroic mode across the horizon, with stirring music.] He explains to the court that he was thirsty, and drank from a spring. [There is a brief shot of him drinking thirstily from a stream.] He says it must have been contaminated, because he was ill and had to get off the horse. The bandit says he knows he is doomed, so he has no reason to hide anything. He says it was he who killed the samurai. [There is a scene of the bandit lounging against a large tree, watching as the samurai (Masayuki Mori) and his wife (Machiko Kyo) pass by, the samurai eyeing the bandit warily.] The bandit says he initially intended ""to take her without killing the man.""Throughout the woodcutter's narration of the bandit's testimony the bandit's bravado and dignity are undercut. He has animal-like mannerisms, and appears indolent and ignoble, constantly scratching and swatting flies.The bandit runs through the woods to catch up to the couple. He accosts the samurai, lures him into the woods with a tale of a cache of swords he will sell cheap, and jumps him from behind. He laughs in triumph, and goes to get the wife, tricking her by saying her husband has suddenly ""taken sick."" In the courthouse garden the bandit says the wife's look of concern made him jealous, and this made him want to humiliate the samurai.Running through the woods, led by the bandit, the wife loses her hat. When they reach the grove she sees her husband tied to a tree stump. The wife, at first frozen and powerless, suddenly draws a dagger and fiercely attacks the bandit. She struggles, but eventually gives up. The bandit kisses her. She drops the dagger and embraces him.In the court the bandit says that he ""had succeeded in having her without killing her husband."" Having got what he wanted, it would make sense for the bandit to leave the scene while he can easily get away.In the grove, the bandit begins to leave, taking the samurai's sword. But the woman makes a bizarre melodramatic request that the men duel to the death. In response, he frees the samurai and lets him have his sword back. There is a fierce, dramatic sword fight. The bandit finally kills the samurai.In the courthouse garden the bandit boasts that it was an honourable, impressive fight, claiming they ""crossed swords 23 times."" When asked about the woman, he has to think a moment about this odd loose end, and supposes she ran off in fright (contrary to the fierce spirit that had attracted him). Responding to further questions, the bandit says that he sold the samurai's sword to buy liquor, and that he had forgotten the dagger--a ""foolish"" mistake, as it ""looked very valuable.""In the Rashomon gatehouse the woodcutter says the bandit's and the woman's stories were lies. The commoner observes that this is human. ""Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves."" The priest laments that this is because men are ""weak."" The priest says the woman was found hiding in a temple, and that she appeared at the enquiry. He says she showed no fierceness, was ""almost pitiful.""The priest takes over the narration, and begins relating the woman's testimony.The woman is in the courthouse garden, prostrate and weeping. She says after forcing her to ""yield to him"" the bandit laughed mockingly. In the grove, the bandit takes the samurai's sword and runs off. The woman embraces her bound husband, but he remains impassive. In the court, the woman says she saw ""neither anger, nor sorrow, but a cold light, a look of loathing."" In the grove, she begs him to stop, but he continues to look at her with cold disdain. She collapses in despair, then retrieves the dagger, cuts his bonds, and tells him to kill her. When he does not respond, she pleads for him to stop condemning her with his silence, and repeats this over and over as she approaches him with the dagger clenched in her hand.In the courthouse garden she says that she must have fainted and that when she came to she saw her dagger in her dead husband's chest. She says she remembers only a pond [There is a brief shot of the surface of a pond.], and throwing herself in, and failing with several other attempts to kill herself. She dissolves in tears.In the Rashomon gatehouse, the commoner comments that women ""use their tears to fool everyone."" The priest mentions ""the dead man's story,"" explaining that ""he spoke through a medium."" The woodcutter says, ""His story was also lies,"" and he looks away from them, agitated. The priest refuses to believe a dead man would be so sinful as to lie, but the cynical commoner observes: ""But is there anyone who's really good? Maybe goodness is just make-believe. . . Man just wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the made-up good stuff. It's easier that way."" He asks the priest to continue.In the courthouse garden, the medium (Fumiko Honma) performs a ritual around a small altar, and goes into a trance. When she speaks, it is the samurai's voice that is heard.The medium/samurai tells a story that incorporates sentiments and actions that vilify the woman, and are out of character and illogical for the bandit, but that result in the bandit and the woman leaving separately, with the samurai free of his bonds. In this sequence there are frequent cuts between the grove and the courthouse garden.The medium/samurai says the bandit ""tried to console his wife."" In the grove, the bandit is kneeling by the woman, who is lying on the ground. He ""was cunning,"" telling the woman that he loved her, and that she should marry him now. She gives in to him, and agrees to go with him ""wherever."" But then she tells the bandit to kill her husband. The bandit is appalled, throws her to the ground, and asks the samurai what he wants: ""Kill her or save her? You only have to nod.""

                    A priest, a woodcutter and another man are taking refuge from a rainstorm in the shell of a former gatehouse called Rashômon. The priest and the woodcutter are recounting the story of a murdered samurai whose body the woodcutter discovered three days earlier in a forest grove. Both were summoned to testify at the murder trial, the priest who ran into the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest just before the murder occurred. Three other people who testified at the trial are supposedly the only direct witnesses: a notorious bandit named Tajômaru, who allegedly murdered the samurai and raped his wife; the white veil cloaked wife of the samurai; and the samurai himself who testifies through the use of a medium. The three tell a similarly structured story - that Tajômaru kidnapped and bound the samurai so that he could rape the wife - but which ultimately contradict each other, the motivations and the actual killing being what differ. The woodcutter reveals at Rashômon that he knows more than he let on at the trial, thus bringing into question his own actions. But another discovery at Rashômon and the resulting actions from the discovery bring back into focus the woodcutter's own humanity or lack thereof.

                    Sheltering from a rainstorm in the derelict Rashomon gatehouse, a commoner wants to hear the strange story that has horrified a priest and confounded a woodcutter. They tell him about a murder inquiry at which they have just appeared as witnesses. Tajomaru (a bandit with a reputation for murder and lust) had managed to tie up a samurai and rape his wife. The woodcutter had discovered the dead body of the samurai in the forest, and the bandit was arrested the following day. But how the samurai was killed was unclear. Strangely, the three people involved all claim to be responsible. The bandit describes winning a dramatic sword fight. The distraught woman all but admits she was driven to stab her husband in desperation. Through a medium, the dead samurai claims his wife was treacherous, and that this drove him to suicide. Something has motivated at least two of them to lie, grotesquely subverting truth, justice, and decency. Even the woodcutter has not been forthright, and ironically, he feels that he too must lie. He changes his story, claims to have witnessed the crime, and gives yet another (the fourth) wild version of the samurai's death. The commoner is not fooled, and it only reinforces his cynical view of life. Then the men make a discovery, and their reactions reveal that, though there is terrible evil and mistrust in the world, there is also goodness.

Tajomaru is captured shortly afterward and is put on trial, but his story and the wife's are so completely different that a psychic is brought in to allow the murdered man to give his own testimony. He tells yet another completely different story.

    Synopsis
    Sheltering from a rainstorm in the ruins of the Rashomon gatehouse, a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) sit dejected. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them, and wants to hear the ""strange story"" they have just heard at a murder enquiry in the courthouse garden. The story has horrified the priest. Even though ""year after year, it's been nothing but disasters,"" he has ""never heard a story as horrible as this."" The woodcutter is utterly confounded, and hopes the commoner can help him understand it.The woodcutter begins the narration, telling the commoner that three days earlier he had gone ""into the mountains to get wood.""The woodcutter is walking through the woods, carrying his axe. Sunlight filters through the foliage, dappling everything with a mix of sun and sharp shadows. He sees a woman's hat caught on a bush. Further along, he picks up a samurai's hat and some cut up rope. He sees something small amongst the leaves on the ground, and goes towards it, but does not notice the corpse right in front of him until he trips over it. He screams and, dropping everything (including his axe), runs away. He says, ""I ran as fast as I could to tell the police. Then, three days later--today--I was called to testify.""The woodcutter is seated in the sunlit courthouse garden, addressing the court, unseen and unheard behind the camera. He testifies that he is the one who found the body. Asked if he saw ""a sword or something,"" he protests emphatically that he found ""nothing at all"" but the hats, rope, and ""a shiny amulet case."" And here he lets slip two additional details: the rope was ""near the body"" and the amulet case had ""a red lining.""The priest is seated in the courthouse garden. He testifies that he saw the man three days earlier, travelling on the road with a woman on a horse, and armed with a sword and bow and arrows. [There is a brief shot of the samurai passing on the road, turning to smile at his wife.] The priest comments on the fragility of life and offers condolences to someone off screen--presumably the wife.The policeman (Daisuke Kato) is seated in the courthouse garden. The bandit (Toshiro Mifune) is sitting beside him, bound. The policeman identifies the bandit as the notorious Tajomaru. He had captured him two days earlier, at dusk. [There is a brief shot of the policeman finding the bandit writhing in agony on a riverbank. The bandit pushes him into the river.] He describes the weapons and horse belonging to the samurai. He concludes that Tajomaru must have fallen from the stolen horse.The bandit hotly denies falling from his horse. [There is a brief shot depicting the bandit as he wants to be perceived: galloping in heroic mode across the horizon, with stirring music.] He explains to the court that he was thirsty, and drank from a spring. [There is a brief shot of him drinking thirstily from a stream.] He says it must have been contaminated, because he was ill and had to get off the horse. The bandit says he knows he is doomed, so he has no reason to hide anything. He says it was he who killed the samurai. [There is a scene of the bandit lounging against a large tree, watching as the samurai (Masayuki Mori) and his wife (Machiko Kyo) pass by, the samurai eyeing the bandit warily.] The bandit says he initially intended ""to take her without killing the man.""Throughout the woodcutter's narration of the bandit's testimony the bandit's bravado and dignity are undercut. He has animal-like mannerisms, and appears indolent and ignoble, constantly scratching and swatting flies.The bandit runs through the woods to catch up to the couple. He accosts the samurai, lures him into the woods with a tale of a cache of swords he will sell cheap, and jumps him from behind. He laughs in triumph, and goes to get the wife, tricking her by saying her husband has suddenly ""taken sick."" In the courthouse garden the bandit says the wife's look of concern made him jealous, and this made him want to humiliate the samurai.Running through the woods, led by the bandit, the wife loses her hat. When they reach the grove she sees her husband tied to a tree stump. The wife, at first frozen and powerless, suddenly draws a dagger and fiercely attacks the bandit. She struggles, but eventually gives up. The bandit kisses her. She drops the dagger and embraces him.In the court the bandit says that he ""had succeeded in having her without killing her husband."" Having got what he wanted, it would make sense for the bandit to leave the scene while he can easily get away.In the grove, the bandit begins to leave, taking the samurai's sword. But the woman makes a bizarre melodramatic request that the men duel to the death. In response, he frees the samurai and lets him have his sword back. There is a fierce, dramatic sword fight. The bandit finally kills the samurai.In the courthouse garden the bandit boasts that it was an honourable, impressive fight, claiming they ""crossed swords 23 times."" When asked about the woman, he has to think a moment about this odd loose end, and supposes she ran off in fright (contrary to the fierce spirit that had attracted him). Responding to further questions, the bandit says that he sold the samurai's sword to buy liquor, and that he had forgotten the dagger--a ""foolish"" mistake, as it ""looked very valuable.""In the Rashomon gatehouse the woodcutter says the bandit's and the woman's stories were lies. The commoner observes that this is human. ""Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves."" The priest laments that this is because men are ""weak."" The priest says the woman was found hiding in a temple, and that she appeared at the enquiry. He says she showed no fierceness, was ""almost pitiful.""The priest takes over the narration, and begins relating the woman's testimony.The woman is in the courthouse garden, prostrate and weeping. She says after forcing her to ""yield to him"" the bandit laughed mockingly. In the grove, the bandit takes the samurai's sword and runs off. The woman embraces her bound husband, but he remains impassive. In the court, the woman says she saw ""neither anger, nor sorrow, but a cold light, a look of loathing."" In the grove, she begs him to stop, but he continues to look at her with cold disdain. She collapses in despair, then retrieves the dagger, cuts his bonds, and tells him to kill her. When he does not respond, she pleads for him to stop condemning her with his silence, and repeats this over and over as she approaches him with the dagger clenched in her hand.In the courthouse garden she says that she must have fainted and that when she came to she saw her dagger in her dead husband's chest. She says she remembers only a pond [There is a brief shot of the surface of a pond.], and throwing herself in, and failing with several other attempts to kill herself. She dissolves in tears.In the Rashomon gatehouse, the commoner comments that women ""use their tears to fool everyone."" The priest mentions ""the dead man's story,"" explaining that ""he spoke through a medium."" The woodcutter says, ""His story was also lies,"" and he looks away from them, agitated. The priest refuses to believe a dead man would be so sinful as to lie, but the cynical commoner observes: ""But is there anyone who's really good? Maybe goodness is just make-believe. . . Man just wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the made-up good stuff. It's easier that way."" He asks the priest to continue.In the courthouse garden, the medium (Fumiko Honma) performs a ritual around a small altar, and goes into a trance. When she speaks, it is the samurai's voice that is heard.The medium/samurai tells a story that incorporates sentiments and actions that vilify the woman, and are out of character and illogical for the bandit, but that result in the bandit and the woman leaving separately, with the samurai free of his bonds. In this sequence there are frequent cuts between the grove and the courthouse garden.The medium/samurai says the bandit ""tried to console his wife."" In the grove, the bandit is kneeling by the woman, who is lying on the ground. He ""was cunning,"" telling the woman that he loved her, and that she should marry him now. She gives in to him, and agrees to go with him ""wherever."" But then she tells the bandit to kill her husband. The bandit is appalled, throws her to the ground, and asks the samurai what he wants: ""Kill her or save her? You only have to nod."" The medium/samurai laughs with triumphant satisfaction, and says: ""For those words alone, I was ready to pardon his crime.""The woman runs away. The bandit chases her, but is unable to catch her. He returns, exhausted and frustrated. He cuts the samurai's bindings, and leaves, taking both swords. The samurai weeps. He sees his wife's dagger, and uses it to stab himself. In court, the medium collapses. In the background, the woodcutter's attention is riveted. The medium/samurai says: ""Then someone quietly approached me. That someone gently withdrew the dagger from my heart."" When the medium's testimony stops there, the woodcutter relaxes.In the Rashomon gatehouse, the woodcutter paces thoughtfully.

He describes actions that are out of character and implausible, and the demeanor of the characters fluctuates wildly. There is no music--only the sounds of insects, rustling leaves, and gasping breath.In the grove, the bandit begs the woman to go with him, and says he will do anything for her. She retrieves the dagger, and cuts the samurai's bonds. The samurai is still wearing his sword, but just stands there. The bandit assumes she wants them to fight a duel.

Dowd is an endlessly pleasant and delightfully eccentric bachelor living in a small town that isn't quite aware that its newest citizen is a invisible, 6'3"" white rabbit named ""Harvey,"" that only certain people can see. After supposedly meeting this rabbit - its origins attributed to the Celtic legend of the Pooka - Dowd's sanity is put into question by his equally eccentric sister, Veta Louise.Elwood casually drives his sister's guests from their house by introducing and carrying on one-sided conversations with his invisible and silent friend. His sister and niece, Myrtle Mae, resort to taking him to the local sanitarium to have him committed. However, owing to people not paying attention, interrupting, and cutting Elwood off as he is about to introduce his imaginary friend, it doesn't immediately appear that there is anything wrong with him, although the examining doctor is sure he is doing the right thing by admitting him.Elwood is carted upstairs by a rough-handed and simple-minded man in the white coat while the examining doctor ushers the sister into the head psychiatrist's --Dr. Chumley's-- office to give a description of the problem. As Elwood is ""escorted"" to hydrotherapy, he tells the man in the white coat his friend ""Harvey"" is a ""Pooka"" The Aide later looks up the definition in the dictionary: ""Celtic mythology, a mischievous spirit that takes animal form and appears sometimes to some people for the purpose of doing this and that.""As Veta, still highly upset over Elwood driving away her friends, bemoans Elwoods delusions to Dr. Chumley, her frazzled manner and insistence that Elwood actually does have a six foot 3 inch invisible rabbit for a friend convinces Chumley it is she, not Elwood, who is hallucinating.He quickly has Veta carted upstairs and, fearing a lawsuit for incarcerating and treating a sane man, brings Elwood down and makes every manner of friendly gesture, including firing the examining doctor, Dr. Sanderson . His nurse, Miss Kelly, who is actually quite fond of Dr. Sanderson, is crestfallen, but, upset at being fired, the good doctor is unaware of her feelings for him, and this angers her.Elwood in his normal good natured way takes no exception to any of the events and once again, as he is about to introduce ""Harvey,"" gets cut off, interrupted and ignored while Dr. Chumley pursues his patronizing commentary. Never one to interrupt, the pinnacle of politeness, Elwood lets him say whatever he is going to say and is finally given a pass to leave. Soon Veta's friends, including Judge Gaffney, and Myrtle Mae arrive. The mistake is uncovered, and the entire group goes into a panic trying to find Elwood. Veta and the Judge Gaffney promise to sue the sanitarium for wrongful incarceration and rough treatment.Distraught, Elwood drinks heavily and retires to his favorite watering hole, Charlie's. Dr. Chumley, himself, tracks Elwood down, but while he is doing this, everyone else is looking in other places. When it finally becomes apparent to everyone that the Doctor has been gone for over four hours and that Elwood is not back in custody, another major panic ensues and the group descends on Charlie's to see what has happened to Dr. Chumley.Elwood, of course, is sitting alone, drinking, and maintains that the doctor left the bar with Harvey. They are convinced he is a madman and has done away with the doctor. However, in his easygoing and pleasant manner, Elwood sidetracks everyone with drinks and conversation and disarms them. Eventually the subject does turn back to the missing doctor, and the panic ensues again.The police are summoned, the heavy handed man in the white coat muscles Elwood back to the sanitarium, but not before becoming infatuated with Myrtle Mae and making advances toward her. Although he is a big galoot, she's attracted to him. The entire entourage, of Veta, Myrtle Mae, Dr. Sanderson, Miss Kelly, Judge Gaffney, the guard and the police, arrive at the sanitarium in a police car and a taxi to discover the doctor is there.However, Dr. Chumley arrives back at the hospital with a look of admiration and fear. Dr. Chumley indeed did leave with Harvey, the Pooka, but he wisely does not say anything about it to anyone, dismisses them all and tells everyone that everything is under control. He tells Dr. Sanderson that he is a fine doctor and can have his job back, then disappears into his office. Sanderson then decides to administer a very powerful injection, called Formula 977, into Elwood that will make him cease with his delusions about the rabbit for once and for all.Meanwhile the cab driver wants his money for the fare. No one seems to have any money so Veta says she'll pay. Digging everything out of her handbag, she discovers her money is gone. She assures the driver that if he waits until Elwood has his injection, she'll pay him handsomely when they are driven back home. The Cab driver however has dour insights into the effects of the injection about to be administered to Elwood. He says he's given many people a ride to the sanitarium for that injection and it changes them into crabby mean people; normal but irritable and unpleasant. Elwood, the most disarming and engaging and mild mannered man in the universe, is on the verge of being turned permanently into a real nuisance, so Veta abruptly changes her mind and rushes in and prevents the injection.Dr. Chumley asks to see Elwood privately in his office where Elwood tells him tells the incredible story of how he came to meet Harvey, and explains the way in which people react when they meet them. Elwood also explains that Harvey has the power to stop time by saying:""Did I tell you he could stop clocks? Well, you've heard the expression 'His face would stop a clock'? Well, Harvey can look at your clock and stop it. And you can go anywhere you like, with anyone you like, and stay as long as you like. And when you get back, not one minute will have ticked by. You see, science has overcome time and space. Well, Harvey has overcome not only time and space, but any objections.""By this point, Dr. Chumley is not only convinced of Harvey's existence, but has begun spending time with him on his own, and requests that Elwood allow Harvey to stay with him for a while and help him out by making his long-needed sabbatical a reality. Apparently this is one of the things Harvey can do if he is so inclined. Elwood asks Harvey if he will work with Chumley and tells Chumley that Harvey agrees.Dr. Sanderson pays for the cab and warms up to the nurse who has a crush on him. The entourage leaves, with the heavy-handed guard and Myrtle Mae making a date to see each other. As the sister digs in her pocketbook she discovers her money purse. She looks over her shoulder and says knowingly, ""Harvey,"" and shakes her head. She knew Harvey existed, and was mischievous, and her only reason for wanting to have Elwood committed was that Elwood's insistence on introducing him to her guests was driving everyone away.As Elwood is leaving, Dr. Chumley asks Elwood for Harvey's help, and Elwood, being the obliging fellow he is, makes no objection. Dr. Chumley, arm in arm with an invisible companion, asks ""Have you ever been to Akron?""In the final shot, after the gates to Chumley's Residence are closed, and Elwood is leaving, he stops, turns around and has a conversation with an invisible Harvey, who is already back from his trip to Akron (only a few minutes have gone by, but it was weeks due to Harvey the Pooka stopping time) and reaffirms their friendship. Harvey opens the security gate (showing only the control handles moving by themselves; Harvey is never seen on camera), and Elwood and his invisible companion saunter off towards the bus stop, following Veta and Myrtle Mae, towards the planned last stop of Charlie's Bar and another drink.","

    Elwood P. Dowd is an endlessly pleasant and delightfully eccentric bachelor living in a small town that isn't quite aware that its newest citizen is a invisible, 6'3"" white rabbit named ""Harvey,"" that only certain people can see.

They are convinced he is a madman and has done away with the doctor. However, in his easygoing and pleasant manner, Elwood sidetracks everyone with drinks and conversation and disarms them. Eventually the subject does turn back to the missing doctor, and the panic ensues again.The police are summoned, the heavy handed man in the white coat muscles Elwood back to the sanitarium, but not before becoming infatuated with Myrtle Mae and making advances toward her. Although he is a big galoot, she's attracted to him. The entire entourage, of Veta, Myrtle Mae, Dr. Sanderson, Miss Kelly, Judge Gaffney, the guard and the police, arrive at the sanitarium in a police car and a taxi to discover the doctor is there.However, Dr. Chumley arrives back at the hospital with a look of admiration and fear. Dr. Chumley indeed did leave with Harvey, the Pooka, but he wisely does not say anything about it to anyone, dismisses them all and tells everyone that everything is under control. He tells Dr. Sanderson that he is a fine doctor and can have his job back, then disappears into his office. Sanderson then decides to administer a very powerful injection, called Formula 977, into Elwood that will make him cease with his delusions about the rabbit for once and for all.Meanwhile the cab driver wants his money for the fare. No one seems to have any money so Veta says she'll pay. Digging everything out of her handbag, she discovers her money is gone. She assures the driver that if he waits until Elwood has his injection, she'll pay him handsomely when they are driven back home. The Cab driver however has dour insights into the effects of the injection about to be administered to Elwood. He says he's given many people a ride to the sanitarium for that injection and it changes them into crabby mean people; normal but irritable and unpleasant. Elwood, the most disarming and engaging and mild mannered man in the universe, is on the verge of being turned permanently into a real nuisance, so Veta abruptly changes her mind and rushes in and prevents the injection.Dr. Chumley asks to see Elwood privately in his office where Elwood tells him tells the incredible story of how he came to meet Harvey, and explains the way in which people react when they meet them. Elwood also explains that Harvey has the power to stop time by saying:""Did I tell you he could stop clocks? Well, you've heard the expression 'His face would stop a clock'? Well, Harvey can look at your clock and stop it. And you can go anywhere you like, with anyone you like, and stay as long as you like. And when you get back, not one minute will have ticked by. You see, science has overcome time and space. Well, Harvey has overcome not only time and space, but any objections.""By this point, Dr. Chumley is not only convinced of Harvey's existence, but has begun spending time with him on his own, and requests that Elwood allow Harvey to stay with him for a while and help him out by making his long-needed sabbatical a reality. Apparently this is one of the things Harvey can do if he is so inclined. Elwood asks Harvey if he will work with Chumley and tells Chumley that Harvey agrees.Dr. Sanderson pays for the cab and warms up to the nurse who has a crush on him. The entourage leaves, with the heavy-handed guard and Myrtle Mae making a date to see each other. As the sister digs in her pocketbook she discovers her money purse. She looks over her shoulder and says knowingly, ""Harvey,"" and shakes her head. She knew Harvey existed, and was mischievous, and her only reason for wanting to have Elwood committed was that Elwood's insistence on introducing him to her guests was driving everyone away.As Elwood is leaving, Dr. Chumley asks Elwood for Harvey's help, and Elwood, being the obliging fellow he is, makes no objection. Dr. Chumley, arm in arm with an invisible companion, asks ""Have you ever been to Akron?""In the final shot, after the gates to Chumley's Residence are closed, and Elwood is leaving, he stops, turns around and has a conversation with an invisible Harvey, who is already back from his trip to Akron (only a few minutes have gone by, but it was weeks due to Harvey the Pooka stopping time) and reaffirms their friendship. Harvey opens the security gate (showing only the control handles moving by themselves; Harvey is never seen on camera), and Elwood and his invisible companion saunter off towards the bus stop, following Veta and Myrtle Mae, towards the planned last stop of Charlie's Bar and another drink.

Captain William Bones, a sickly lodger and merchant marine, gives Hawkins a treasure map after being visited by two pirates, the second of whom (and whom also sports a large scar across his face) gives the captain a note marked with the black spot. That same night Bones is found dead at the inn, and Jim shows Squire Trelawney the map. Trelawney recognizes the map as belonging to the late buccaneer pirate Captain Flint and bankrolls a voyage to discover the pirate's lost treasure. Trelawney hires Captain Smollett and his ship, the Hispaniola, bringing along his friend Dr. Livesey as the ship's doctor and Jim as the cabin boy.Before departure Trelawney is taken in by Long John Silver, a one-legged inn-keeper and cook, who agrees to gather a crew. Silver strikes up a friendship with Jim and joins the expedition as the ship's cook. Smollett is concerned about the crew, especially when he reveals to Trelawney that the nature of their journey is common knowledge.At sea Jim overhears Silver and the crew's plan to mutiny, discovering that the seamen hired by Silver are Captain Flint's old crew of pirates (Silver worked as the cook aboard Flint's ship). Jim reveals the treachery to Smollett who asks Jim to stay friends with Silver to learn more. Upon reaching Treasure Island, Silver offers to tow the ship to a safer anchorage, using two of the ship's row boats. While the ship is being towed, one of Silver's men, Merry, leads a mutiny on the ship. Smollett, having been forewarned of the plot by Jim, is able to hold them off with the few men loyal to him and imprisons the mutineers below decks. Silver cuts the row boats from the Hispaniola and heads for shore with the rest of his men, taking Jim as a hostage. Smollett, Trelawney, and Livesey go ashore after them, leaving two guards on the ship.On the island, Jim escapes and meets Ben Gunn, a disheveled sailor marooned by Flint on the island five years ago. Gunn shows Jim the boat he's built, then leads him to Flint's stockade, where he meets up with Smollett and the others. Meanwhile, Merry escapes, takes the ship and raises the Jolly Roger skull and bones flag. Silver returns to the Hispaniola, arms his men with muskets and makes plans to take the stockade. Short of men, Silver attempts to parlay with Smollett, but when he is rebuffed, Silver calls his men to attack. The assault on the stockade fails with many of the pirates killed and wounded, but Silver shoots and wounds Smollett before retreating. Although seemingly protected by the stockade, Smollett surmises that, with the morning tide, Silver could move the Hispaniola into cannon range and level the fort.That evening, Jim takes Gunn's boat and cuts the Hispaniola's anchor rope. Jim also witnesses two of Long John Silver's men argue, leading to one of them killing the other. The pirate guard, Israel Hands, discovers Jim and chases him up into the ship's rigging to the crows nest. Hands injures Jim arm with a throwing knife but is killed by the boy's pistol who then falls overboard. Jim strikes the Jolly Roger and hoists the Union Jack.Slowed by his wound, it takes him all night to get back to the stockade, which is unguarded. Inside, Jim searches for the doctor to tend his wound, but the man asleep under Livesey's coat is Long John Silver, which his men have taken the stockade. Jim faints on the spot. Silver finds the treasure map on him as his men wake up. Merry wants Jim dead, but Silver states he wants to trade him for the map, which his men believe is with Smollett.

Needing money, he reluctantly takes the job of adapting a trashy novel for the screen. Knowing that this is obviously below him, instead of reading the thing he instead asks a naive, celebrity-obsessed girl (who has read the book) he meets at a restaurant to give him a synopsis, which she does enthusiastically. He sends her home with cab money and is abruptly woken up at 5:00 the next morning by a police officer; the girl was found murdered, and Dix was the last person to see her alive. Given his violent past and what appears to be apathy towards her death, he is the most logical suspect until his beautiful neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) gives him an alibi (though the audience is never quite sure if she is telling the truth or lies because of her attraction to Dix). There is an undeniable connection between Laurel and Dix, and despite her guarded demeanor and his deep internal demons, the two fall madly in love and for a while they enjoy the happiest time of their lives. Meanwhile, the murder investigation continues and Dix is still the most likely suspect. This puts immense strain on their relationship. The pressure on him is mounting, and as he begins to become increasingly impatient and irritable, this makes her back away from him. Sensing this, he is so frightened he'll lose Laurel, he clings ever more tightly to her, which appears controlling and frightens her. After hearing she didn't tell him about going down to the police station to answer more questions, he storms off and almost kills an innocent bystander, and is only stopped by Laurel's plea. After that incident, Laurel begins to truly doubt Dix's innocence. Dix senses this and from the strain of the accusation, the novel and his fears of losing Laurel, his violence has started up again. In addition, his controlling ways continue to increase from his desperation as she pulls further and further away from him emotionally. Though she loves Dix, Laurel fears for her life and plans to leave him. When Dix finds out, he flies into a rage and nearly strangles the woman he loves; the only thing that stops him is a ringing telephone which confirms his innocence. However, he walks away anything but a free man, having lost forever the one person who he truly loved, who truly loved him, and could've made him happy enough to help him deal with his violent nature.","

    Synopsis
    Dixon ""Dix"" Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is a talented but violence-prone and washed up screenwriter. Needing money, he reluctantly takes the job of adapting a trashy novel for the screen. Knowing that this is obviously below him, instead of reading the thing he instead asks a naive, celebrity-obsessed girl (who has read the book) he meets at a restaurant to give him a synopsis, which she does enthusiastically. He sends her home with cab money and is abruptly woken up at 5:00 the next morning by a police officer; the girl was found murdered, and Dix was the last person to see her alive. Given his violent past and what appears to be apathy towards her death, he is the most logical suspect until his beautiful neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) gives him an alibi (though the audience is never quite sure if she is telling the truth or lies because of her attraction to Dix). There is an undeniable connection between Laurel and Dix, and despite her guarded demeanor and his deep internal demons, the two fall madly in love and for a while they enjoy the happiest time of their lives. Meanwhile, the murder investigation continues and Dix is still the most likely suspect. This puts immense strain on their relationship. The pressure on him is mounting, and as he begins to become increasingly impatient and irritable, this makes her back away from him. Sensing this, he is so frightened he'll lose Laurel, he clings ever more tightly to her, which appears controlling and frightens her. After hearing she didn't tell him about going down to the police station to answer more questions, he storms off and almost kills an innocent bystander, and is only stopped by Laurel's plea. After that incident, Laurel begins to truly doubt Dix's innocence. Dix senses this and from the strain of the accusation, the novel and his fears of losing Laurel, his violence has started up again. In addition, his controlling ways continue to increase from his desperation as she pulls further and further away from him emotionally. Though she loves Dix, Laurel fears for her life and plans to leave him. When Dix finds out, he flies into a rage and nearly strangles the woman he loves; the only thing that stops him is a ringing telephone which confirms his innocence. However, he walks away anything but a free man, having lost forever the one person who he truly loved, who truly loved him, and could've made him happy enough to help him deal with his violent nature.

Just released from jail, he has what he considers his final caper mapped out, after which he plans on retiring to Mexico City. A jewel heist, he estimates the take will be in excess of $1 million, enough for his retirement plus the payment to all those involved. It will require the assistance of a few men, one of whom is to be the financier. He turns to lawyer Lon Emmerich for the money, trusting his associate bookie, Cobby, on Emmerich's ability to do the job. Doc also enlists a small time hood, Dix Handley, who he meets at Cobby's betting parlor, to be one of the men to carry out the actual heist. Although he counts on the money from Emmerich, he doesn't really trust him. As the heist is carried out, its execution is not according to Doc's meticulous plan. As each individual makes his escape with Doc holding the loot, the police are on their tail. The crosses and double crosses between each of those individuals, who are ultimately out to protect themselves and their own sense of what is important to them, may make the fragile relationships between the crooks and thus the heist fall apart.

                    Hoping that she will help hide him, Jonathan Cooper confides in his friend Eve Gill, a novice acting student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, that he is helping famed stage actress Charlotte Inwood, with who he is in love, cover up her accidental killing of her husband. Jonathan believes he is in trouble because Charlotte, who was wearing a blood stained dress, asked Jonathan to retrieve a clean dress for her at her supposedly empty house where he suspects he was spotted by the maid, Nellie Goode, just prior to Nellie finding the dead body. Eve agrees to help Jonathan since she is in love with him, and who she believes is being framed by Charlotte. Charlotte's blood stained dress, which she asked Jonathan to destroy but which he still has in his possession, is a key piece of evidence in implicating Charlotte. When the police get involved, Eve tries to find out as much as she can from the lead investigator, Detective Inspector Wilfred Smith - who she ends up calling Ordinary Smith on his request - without divulging her connection to Jonathan. With her equally sleuthing father Commodore Gill behind her, Eve, trying to demonstrate her acting skills, also infiltrates the Inwood household acting as Charlotte's temporary plain housemaid and dresser. These dual roles becomes difficult for Eve to manage, especially in keeping them separated from Ordinary as he continues his investigation, and from Charlotte. In the process, Eve, who still wants to protect her friend Jonathan, ends up falling in love with Ordinary. But as those concerned get closer and closer to discovering the truth behind Inwood's death with Charlotte's blood stained dress a key item in trying to expose the killer, Eve, without realizing it, becomes a possible second target for the murderer.

He provides comedy relief for the entire story, which is quite welcome and wonderful.)The space ship travels to the moon and on the way, a problem develops which requires that crew members go outside of the travelling ship in space suits, and make a repair. One crew member accidentally drifts off into space, but is rescued by another crew member who, creatively, uses an oxygen tank to propel himself to connect with the adrift fellow crew member in danger of being lost in space forever. The rescue scene is all done dramatically and believably, and this is true of additional dramatic moments in the movie.

                    After their latest rocket fails, Dr. Charles Cargraves and retired General Thayer have to start over again. This time, Gen. Thayer approaches Jim Barnes, the head of his own aviation construction firms to help build a rocket that will take them to the moon. Together they gather the captains of industry and all pledge to support the goals of having the United States be the first to put a man on the moon. They build their rocket and successfully leave the Earth's gravitational pull and make the landing as scheduled. Barnes has miscalculated their fuel consumption however and after stripping the ship bare, they are still 100 lbs too heavy meaning that one of them will have to stay behind.

    Synopsis
    DESTINATION MOON (1950) was produced by the legendary George Pal (see his WWW.IMDb.Com bio), and was one of the first great full color 1950's sci-fi outer space thrillers which later included WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE (1951), THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (1953), THIS ISLAND EARTH (1955), and FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956).The movie is intelligent, interesting, dramatic, and highly informative about basic science facts regarding space travel and the difficulties, challenges part of it.By any standard, DESTINATION MOON (1950) is a landmark movie, produced in 1950 which was a high water mark year for world cinema, along with 1939, 1928, and 1956........all years notable for multiple cinema productions of remarkable accomplishment and enduring quality.The story is about a successful first flight to the moon, made by four men who travel in a spacecraft built by a private USA company which must take off unexpectedly early because a ""court order"" has been issued and is about to be delivered to the space travellers STOPPING the trip due to the fact that public opinion is fearful of the consequences of any such effort.The four man team learn of the court order and decide to take off early, before govt. officials can ""serve them"" and stop their departure.They take off...three highly educated and renowned men (one a retired Army general, one a famous scientist with a doctorate, one a respected technology executive, and the fourth....played wonderfully by comedian Dick Wesson playing ""Joe Sweeny of Brooklyn NY USA"".....operates the communications equipment, and portrays a wise-cracking, cowardly ""everyman"" from Brooklyln who doesn't believe the space ship will ever fly, and is astonished and frightened when it does. He provides comedy relief for the entire story, which is quite welcome and wonderful.)The space ship travels to the moon and on the way, a problem develops which requires that crew members go outside of the travelling ship in space suits, and make a repair. One crew member accidentally drifts off into space, but is rescued by another crew member who, creatively, uses an oxygen tank to propel himself to connect with the adrift fellow crew member in danger of being lost in space forever. The rescue scene is all done dramatically and believably, and this is true of additional dramatic moments in the movie. Much of the movie is gripping, and comic moments, well done, are welcome interludes to dramatic crisis parts of DESTINATION MOON (!950).The space ship lands on the moon, and the commander claims the moon for the USA on behalf of all mankind in a statement quite similar to the actual statement the first NASA moon landing astronauts made famous in 1969 (the ""one small step for man, one giant step for mankind"" statement).Suddenly, the four moon explorers learn the space ship they need for return to the Earth is too heavily loaded for departure from the moon, and that they need to unload large quantities of equipment and supplies to lighten the ship and make departure possible.They pitch out large quantities of ""junk"" including used oxygen tanks, radios, and other large metal objects, but in the end, not enough has been removed....110 pounds remain!All four travellers separately volunteer to remain behind, and one (the comic ""Joe Sweeny from Brooklyn"") actually leaves the ship and refuses to return so his remaining three comrades can leave safely.His sacrifice isn't necessary, however, since the ship commander determines that the remaining radio used for contact with the Earth can also be thrown off the ship, and so can the one space suit held back and worn by Joe Sweeny, once he returns to the ship.Sweeny does return to the ship and all four travellers depart successfully from the spacecraft after the radio and space suit are thrown out, and the needed weight removal is accomplished.The ship returns to the Earth with all four travellers safely aboard.

                    The poet Orphée is popular among the general public but detested by the avant-garde at the Café des Poètes. A young poet is killed by two motorbikes just outside the café. His patroness, called The Princess, brings the body to her car, and asks Orphée to come along as a witness. From the car radio a monotonous voice is reciting meaningless lines, which Orphée conceives as the fresh inspiration he has been looking for to renew his writing. In a deserted house he witnesses how The Princess revives the dead poet and disappears with him into a mirror. The chauffeur Heurtebis takes Orphée back home, where Eurydice is longing to tell him that she is pregnant. Orphée ignores her, and sneaks out to the garage, to listen to the captivating voice in the car radio. When Eurydice leaves the house, the two motorbikes kill her on the road. Heurtebis shows the remorseful Orphée how to follow Eurydice through a mirror. When Orphée finds Eurydice in the other world, a court allows them to return to life under the condition that he never looks at her. Orphée is tormented by conflicting feelings, because he is also in love with The Princess, his personal Death.

                    The 1870s, New Mexico territory: T.C. Jeffords is a cattle baron who built his ranch, the Furies, from scratch. He borrows from banks, pays hired hands with his own script (""T.C.'s""), and carries on low-level warfare with the Mexicans who settled the land but are now considered squatters. He has enemies, including Rip Darrow, a saloon owner who's father T.C. took land from. His headstrong daughter, Vance, has a life-long friend in one of the Mexicans, her heart set on Rip, and dad's promise she'll run the Furies someday. Her hopes are smashed by Rip's revenge, a gold-digger who turns T.C.'s head, and T.C.'s own murderous imperialism. Is Vance to be cursed by fury and hatred?

                    Vance is a firebrand, and that's the way her equally iron-willed father, T.C. Jeffords, likes her. Certainly the tyrannical cattle rancher cares more for his daughter than his seemingly weak-willed son, whose wedding is only the ostensible reason for him to end his San Francisco trip earlier than expected and return to The Furies. T.C. needs money, and being something like a feudal lord of the 1870s, all he has to do is print some up: his own money, paper bills called TCs. He also has enough power to drive off the Mexican squatters from his land, but Vance insists he leave the Herrera family alone. She is close friends with the family's eldest son, Juan, who is in love with her. Vance is in love with nobody until she meets Rip Darrow, a flinty gambler who wants back the piece of land he believes rightfully belongs to him. Predictably, father and daughter clash over Rip, but their lively relationship doesn't turn ugly until T.C., who hasn't been serious about a woman since his wife had the effrontery to die, meets an attractive widow who schemes to take control of The Furies herself.

"25","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042531/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In the opening scene, aging gunslinger Jimmy Ringo (Gregory Peck) rides out of the desert night into a small Southwestern town and strides wearily into a saloon. The bartender recognizes Ringo from earlier days in El Paso and greets him. At a nearby table, a group of ranch hands overhears the bartender and speaks in hushed tones about the feared gunfighter and his deadly reputation. One of the men, a brash young buck named Eddie (Richard Jaeckel) resents the respectful attention given to Ringo and decides to test him. He makes several insulting, challenging comments to Ringo, which the gunfighter does his best to ignore. Finally, realizing that the young man is determined to pick a fight, Ringo squares off with him and shoots him dead. It is Ringo's twelfth kill.The bartender explains that the dead man has three brothers in town who will be looking for revenge. Ringo mounts up and moves on, keeping one eye over his shoulder. Sure enough, the brothers follow, but Ringo gets the drop on them a few miles outside of town. He slightly wounds one of them before disarming the group and scattering their horses. The men are forced to pursue Ringo on foot.Ringo rides on to the small town of Cayenne and stops by the Palace Bar, where he is once again recognized by the bartender, Mac (Karl Malden). Mac explains that he and Ringo had crossed paths years ago in Dodge City. Ringo orders breakfast and goes out back to wash up. Mac sends a boy to alert Marshal Mark Strett (Millard Mitchell) that Ringo is in town. Strett gets three men to accompany him to the saloon, where he surprises Ringo. It turns out that Ringo and Strett had ridden together before Strett went straight and became a lawman. The Marshal makes it clear that he wants Ringo to leave town before trouble follows. Ringo admits that some men are after him, but explains that they are still hours away, and he tells Strett that he has come to Cayenne to see his old girlfriend and the son they had together before they became estranged. Strett fiercely protects the privacy of the woman, Peggy Walsh (Helen Westcott), but he agrees to approach her and see if she is open to a meeting with Ringo. Strett also sends a deputy to deliver a warning to young, hotheaded, local gunhand Hunt Bromley (Skip Homeier), hoping to head off another needless shooting. In the meantime, Ringo finds out that Bromley had once tried unsuccessfully to move in on Peggy.Bromley soon rides into town and hears that Ringo is at the Palace Saloon. The young gun hand walks into the saloon and loudly orders a whiskey. He immediately complains about the ""watered down"" whiskey and demands a round for the whole house to prove his point. He carries a bottle over to Ringo's table and aggressively insists that Ringo try the whiskey. When Ringo demurs, Bromley presses the point. Ringo dismissively insults the cocky young man and advises him to leave while he still can. When Bromley tries to push the issue further, Ringo coolly informs him that he is holding a revolver under the table, pointed directly at the young man. He orders Bromley to turn around and walk out, humiliating him.Meanwhile, the three brothers who are after Ringo have made it on foot to a relay station where fresh horses and guns are available for them. They saddle up and head for Cayenne, with the horses allowing them to arrive hours earlier than Ringo had anticipated.When a girlfriend tells Peggy that Ringo came to town expressly to see her and the boy, she is still hesitant. The friend further explains that Ringo has matured and mellowed, but Peggy isn't ready to believe it. She can't abide returning to a life of sudden violence and insecurity.The Marshal now orders Hunt Bromley out of town in hopes of avoiding another confrontation and also sends his deputy to the saloon to keep an eye on things. The situation becomes even more complicated thanks to an angry citizen who mistakenly believes that Ringo killed his son. Rooming at the hotel across the street from the saloon, the man keeps watch from a window and waits on his chance to get even. When Ringo and the deputy step through the saloon door, the man aims a rifle at Ringo, who fortunately sees the sun glint on the barrel. He quickly retreats into the saloon, sneaks out the back door, and climbs the rear stairs of the hotel. He gets the drop on the man and takes him to the marshal's office to lock him up. Finding no one present at the jail, Ringo locates the keys and does the honors himself.A comedic interlude ensues when a delegation of proper townswomen arrives at the marshal's office, led by elderly Mrs. August Pennyfeather. Mistaking Ringo for a jailer, they announce their demand that the Marshal and his deputies arrest the ""murderous"" gunfighter immediately. Flummoxed, Ringo politely plays along, identifying himself as a friend of Marshal Strett. As the women stridently denounce Ringo's violent history, Ringo stays in his jailer character and tries to defend his own past as if he were just an unbiased advocate for a presumably innocent stranger. He chalks many of the killings up to a ""misunderstanding."" When Mrs. Pennyfeather sarcastically decries Ringo's ""fifty"" misunderstandings, Ringo protests and corrects the record down to fifteen or so. They then accuse him of unfairly taking up for the murderous gunman. In response, Ringo lamely concedes that a case could perhaps be made for having the gunslinger arrested or run out of town. Another woman then demands that the killer be hung, with Ringo growing more and more uncomfortable by the minute. Just in the nick of time, Marshal Strett arrives. He answers the ladies' fervent demands for action by saying that Ringo will soon be on his way out of town without any bloodletting required. Mrs. Pennyfeather says she is satisfied to wait for another hour or so, after which time Ringo should be ""shot down like a dog."" They thank Marshal Strett for his reasonable attitude before he gestures toward ""Mr. Ringo"" and suggests they thank him instead. Horrified, the chastened women quickly shuffle out of the jail.Strett now procures a fresh horse for Ringo and prepares to hustle him out of town. Just as Ringo saddles up, Peggy finally arrives to meet with him and delays his departure. He begs her to give him a second chance at settling down with her and the boy and she finally agrees to consider it if he is still alive in another year. Elated, Ringo asks to see his son before he leaves. While he waits, the three vengeful brothers arrive; one covers the saloon's front entrance while the others prepare an ambush from a hayloft behind the saloon, where Ringo's saddled horse is waiting. Ringo has a brief meeting with the boy and establishes some tentative ties. Finally saying his goodbyes, Ringo and Strett exit the rear of the saloon. Just as two of the three brothers prepare to ambush Ringo, Strett's deputy sights them from down below and aims his shotgun at them. They surrender and it appears that all is clear for Ringo's escape. He mounts up and starts to ride off. Just then, Hunt Bromley steps out from behind a wagon and shoots Ringo twice in the back. Mortally wounded, Ringo is helped out of the stirrups and stretched out in the alleyway. The smirking Bromley is dragged over to view his cowardly handiwork, and Ringo surprises everyone by saying that he drew first on Bromley, and that Bromley had beaten him. Strett objects to the obvious lie, but Ringo looks Bromley squarely in the eye and explains that by doing it this way he has condemned the young man to an uncertain, dangerous future as the man who got the infamous Jimmy Ringo, fair and square. Every young gun within reach will be out to earn a reputation by killing him. Ringo closes his eyes for the last time as Strett drags Bromley into a barn, administering a savage beating before running him out of town. Ringo's funeral, at which Peggy uses the name Mrs. Ringo for the first time, closes the movie.","

The men are forced to pursue Ringo on foot.Ringo rides on to the small town of Cayenne and stops by the Palace Bar, where he is once again recognized by the bartender, Mac (Karl Malden). Mac explains that he and Ringo had crossed paths years ago in Dodge City. Ringo orders breakfast and goes out back to wash up. Mac sends a boy to alert Marshal Mark Strett (Millard Mitchell) that Ringo is in town. Strett gets three men to accompany him to the saloon, where he surprises Ringo. It turns out that Ringo and Strett had ridden together before Strett went straight and became a lawman. The Marshal makes it clear that he wants Ringo to leave town before trouble follows. Ringo admits that some men are after him, but explains that they are still hours away, and he tells Strett that he has come to Cayenne to see his old girlfriend and the son they had together before they became estranged. Strett fiercely protects the privacy of the woman, Peggy Walsh (Helen Westcott), but he agrees to approach her and see if she is open to a meeting with Ringo. Strett also sends a deputy to deliver a warning to young, hotheaded, local gunhand Hunt Bromley (Skip Homeier), hoping to head off another needless shooting. In the meantime, Ringo finds out that Bromley had once tried unsuccessfully to move in on Peggy.Bromley soon rides into town and hears that Ringo is at the Palace Saloon. The young gun hand walks into the saloon and loudly orders a whiskey. He immediately complains about the ""watered down"" whiskey and demands a round for the whole house to prove his point. He carries a bottle over to Ringo's table and aggressively insists that Ringo try the whiskey. When Ringo demurs, Bromley presses the point. Ringo dismissively insults the cocky young man and advises him to leave while he still can. When Bromley tries to push the issue further, Ringo coolly informs him that he is holding a revolver under the table, pointed directly at the young man. He orders Bromley to turn around and walk out, humiliating him.Meanwhile, the three brothers who are after Ringo have made it on foot to a relay station where fresh horses and guns are available for them. They saddle up and head for Cayenne, with the horses allowing them to arrive hours earlier than Ringo had anticipated.When a girlfriend tells Peggy that Ringo came to town expressly to see her and the boy, she is still hesitant. The friend further explains that Ringo has matured and mellowed, but Peggy isn't ready to believe it. She can't abide returning to a life of sudden violence and insecurity.The Marshal now orders Hunt Bromley out of town in hopes of avoiding another confrontation and also sends his deputy to the saloon to keep an eye on things. The situation becomes even more complicated thanks to an angry citizen who mistakenly believes that Ringo killed his son. Rooming at the hotel across the street from the saloon, the man keeps watch from a window and waits on his chance to get even. When Ringo and the deputy step through the saloon door, the man aims a rifle at Ringo, who fortunately sees the sun glint on the barrel. He quickly retreats into the saloon, sneaks out the back door, and climbs the rear stairs of the hotel. He gets the drop on the man and takes him to the marshal's office to lock him up. Finding no one present at the jail, Ringo locates the keys and does the honors himself.A comedic interlude ensues when a delegation of proper townswomen arrives at the marshal's office, led by elderly Mrs. August Pennyfeather. Mistaking Ringo for a jailer, they announce their demand that the Marshal and his deputies arrest the ""murderous"" gunfighter immediately. Flummoxed, Ringo politely plays along, identifying himself as a friend of Marshal Strett. As the women stridently denounce Ringo's violent history, Ringo stays in his jailer character and tries to defend his own past as if he were just an unbiased advocate for a presumably innocent stranger. He chalks many of the killings up to a ""misunderstanding."" When Mrs. Pennyfeather sarcastically decries Ringo's ""fifty"" misunderstandings, Ringo protests and corrects the record down to fifteen or so. They then accuse him of unfairly taking up for the murderous gunman. In response, Ringo lamely concedes that a case could perhaps be made for having the gunslinger arrested or run out of town. Another woman then demands that the killer be hung, with Ringo growing more and more uncomfortable by the minute. Just in the nick of time, Marshal Strett arrives. He answers the ladies' fervent demands for action by saying that Ringo will soon be on his way out of town without any bloodletting required. Mrs. Pennyfeather says she is satisfied to wait for another hour or so, after which time Ringo should be ""shot down like a dog."" They thank Marshal Strett for his reasonable attitude before he gestures toward ""Mr. Ringo"" and suggests they thank him instead. Horrified, the chastened women quickly shuffle out of the jail.Strett now procures a fresh horse for Ringo and prepares to hustle him out of town. Just as Ringo saddles up, Peggy finally arrives to meet with him and delays his departure. He begs her to give him a second chance at settling down with her and the boy and she finally agrees to consider it if he is still alive in another year. Elated, Ringo asks to see his son before he leaves. While he waits, the three vengeful brothers arrive; one covers the saloon's front entrance while the others prepare an ambush from a hayloft behind the saloon, where Ringo's saddled horse is waiting. Ringo has a brief meeting with the boy and establishes some tentative ties. Finally saying his goodbyes, Ringo and Strett exit the rear of the saloon. Just as two of the three brothers prepare to ambush Ringo, Strett's deputy sights them from down below and aims his shotgun at them. They surrender and it appears that all is clear for Ringo's escape. He mounts up and starts to ride off. Just then, Hunt Bromley steps out from behind a wagon and shoots Ringo twice in the back. Mortally wounded, Ringo is helped out of the stirrups and stretched out in the alleyway. The smirking Bromley is dragged over to view his cowardly handiwork, and Ringo surprises everyone by saying that he drew first on Bromley, and that Bromley had beaten him. Strett objects to the obvious lie, but Ringo looks Bromley squarely in the eye and explains that by doing it this way he has condemned the young man to an uncertain, dangerous future as the man who got the infamous Jimmy Ringo, fair and square. Every young gun within reach will be out to earn a reputation by killing him. Ringo closes his eyes for the last time as Strett drags Bromley into a barn, administering a savage beating before running him out of town. Ringo's funeral, at which Peggy uses the name Mrs. Ringo for the first time, closes the movie.

What he wants is more power and money, which is the reason he has come to Washington DC, specifically to bribe a congressman or two, only the latest of his illegal activities. Among Harry's entourage is his fiancée of seven years, Billie Dawn, a former showgirl and an uneducated seemingly stereotypical dumb blonde. Beyond throwing money at her or playing gin rummy with her, Harry largely ignores Billie, or when he does spend time with her treats her badly, despite he being in his brand of love with her. As Harry is embarrassed by Billie's uncultured ways in dealing with the political elite of Washington - in the process he being clueless or unconcerned as to his own crudeness - he decides to hire Paul Verrall, a local freelance reporter writing a story on him, to teach Billie how to be cultured. Paul gladly accepts the job in his enjoyment of showing all that Washington DC has to offer in its history and politics, but not for Harry, who he does not like much. Paul finds that Billie is an eager student regardless of she seeing herself as being dumb and uneducatable.

"28","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042832/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","At night, on a seedy street of New Orleans, we see an upper floor window that is thrown open. In that room a poker game is under way. One of the players is seaman Kochak (Lewis Charles), who gathers a large pot he has just won and says he feels sick and needs to go rest. The other players object, Blackie (Jack Palance), Raymond Fitch, ( Zero Mostel), and Poldi (Guy Tomajan), claiming that it was too early to quit. Despite threats, Kochak leaves. Blackie quickly talks to the other two, ordering them to bring back Kochak or the money. Raymond and Poldi follow Kochak out, stop him and push him, but Kochak continues on his way. Raymond and Poldi are giving up, but an angry Blackie demands that he be followed. Some distance away, in the dock area, Kochak is surrounded, there is a brief fight. Blackie kills Kochak with two shots and orders Raymond and Poldi to get rid of the body after retrieving the money.The next morning, Dr. Clinton Reed, a U.S. Public Health Service officer (Richard Widmark) is at home looking forward to a day off with his wife Nancy (Barbara Bel Geddes) and son Tommy (Tommy Rettig), We see him as a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary, as there are bills that have gone unpaid for quite a while.From a dock on the river front, the dead body of Kochak has been spotted, and policemen pick it up and take it to the morgue. The coroner technician digs out the two bullets and notices something strange with the body. Immediately he isolates the body and phones Dr. Reed at home.Dr. Reed reluctantly agrees to come back to the morgue, and confirms the dead man had pneumonic plague, similar to bubonic plague but attacking the lungs, and transmitted not by rats but by coughing and sneezing and physical contact among people. He takes charge, isolates everyone who touched the body, has the body cremated and starts inoculating the policemen and morgue technicians.At a hastily summoned emergency meeting with mayor Murray (H. Fowler, Jr.), police chief Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) and other authorities, Reed describes the potentially enormous consequences and deaths that could ensue from not finding those infected. Death occurs within four days of the onset of illness, and illness within about two days of contagious exposure. So they have a 48 hour window to try to find those exposed and prevent further illnesses by inoculations.Since the dead man was moved by his killers, the killers have been exposed and must be found. The search has to be done with a different excuse, otherwise the killers might leave town and potentially infect the whole nation. The secret must also be kept from the public, otherwise there would be a mass exodus that might spread the illness through a vast area.The mayor supports Reed, the rest go along very reluctantly. Warren objects that he has an impossible job because the murder victim is unidentified, but grumblingly he promises to do his best. Reed and Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other as they start off on their search for the killers.Warren orders a round up of all known petty criminals and suspects, who are shown a picture of the murder victim and are asked what they know. Reed is so involved an intense that he gets in the way of the police procedures, so he goes on his own to try other ways to identify the murder victim.Dr. Reed goes into the seamens hiring hall and offers a $50 reward to anyone who can identify the murder victim, to no avail. He senses there is a reluctance to give information, so he announces he will wait at a nearby café, Franks Place just in case anyone wants to talk to him. After some waiting, a girl comes to him and says she thinks she knows a boat owner who might have seen the unidentified victim. Reed follows her to a boat and the owner denies knowing anything. After some pushing, the owner says he also owns a café that is run by his wife and will ask his wife.At the café, the wife is consulted by her husband out of sight from Reed. She recognizes the man but refuses to admit it. She complains of having a headache, and she starts to cough.Meantime, Blackie, Raymond and Poldi have sensed that the police is after something important, and Blackie guesses that the dead man, who was Poldi's cousin, is much more important than one would guess from a merchant seaman, and imagine that Kochak had information about some treasure or drug stash.A scene in Blackies supposed legitimate business serves to define the characters of both Blackie and Raymond. Blackie argues with Raymond and his shrewish wife (Liswood), and shows Raymonds frantic subservience as he tries to pacify each, like some berserk pinball.There are brief scenes where Blackie's complex character is further developed. When a stunning prostitute asks Blackie for $100 (the equivalent of $1000 in 2010), he doesn't hesitate. When a little newspaper seller gives him some information, he insists on giving money to him, although, he doesn't want it. When a doctor tells him that the man he is trying to kill is sick and needs an expensive sanitarium, Blackie quickly offers the money. He may be a killer, but he sure is generous.The film intersperses small scenes that grab attention simply by making the characters and their little exchanges interesting. Like the Irish dwarf, for instance, who refuses to take payment for his favors, looking up at the towering Blackie, saying, ""No, Blackie, no."" And then after Blackie stuffs the bills into his sweater, he hobbles away backwards and saying, ""God bless ye, Blackie, God bless ye.""In the same vein, Reeds character is developed as struggles with his status as a nearly absentee dad, slaving away at a job that pays him poorly and barely managing to spend any time with his wife and son. The $50 reward he offers for information means the bill he was going to pay will have to wait.Blackie starts to suspect Poldi of holding out on him, since Kochak was Poldi's cousin, so Poldi disappears trying to get away from Blackie.Meantime, the wife of the café owner has been taken to a hospital, and dies from the plague. Her husband arrives, and Dr. Reed is able to extract more information due to the heavy guilt and grief. Kochak is identified as having arrived in a ship called the Queen of the Nile, which is still within reach of the authorities.The ship is boarded, and despite the Captains denials and lack of cooperation, Reed succeeds in questioning the crew, and finds that there had been a recent death on board. The interview of two Asian cooks aboard the Nile Queen is hilarious -- ""He cawr me dirty names and ask for Shishabob!"" Later, loudly proclaiming that the crew will start dying in just a few days, Reed succeeds in convincing the seamen to get inoculated. The captain yields as his crew starts to mutiny.During these searches, three times, Reed just misses meeting up with Raymond. The viewer is tantalized with both men in the same frame but unaware of the connection between them.The film has a subplot in which a news reporter, who wears his ""Freedom of Speech"" as a badge of honour, is shut down and locked away in a jail, to prevent him from publishing a story that might indeed trigger panic in the streets. This is a decision by the mayor at the urging of Reed that gives rise to a brief discussion of Constitutional rights.Eventually Blackie finds and interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband. Cat like, Blackie stalks his victim across the room, eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed, holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands. Meantime, Poldi's mother has summoned a nurse, whose entrance prevents Blackie from torturing the dying Poldi. She is aware of the seriousness of Poldi's condition, and refuses to leave. Blackie summons his own doctor, and the doctor expels the nurse, who manages to get messages to Reed about the situation. Were it not for the serendipitous perceptive nurse, Reed and Warren might still be looking for the killers.The doctor together with Blackie Fitch start to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed. Poldi is thrown down to his death, and an exciting chase follows. Blackie and Raymond hijack a van to flee, as they are being chased by Reed, Warren, and half the New Orleans Police, first in 1949 Ford police cars, then on foot after the van is surrounded. The two escaping killers try to throw off the pursuers in a coffee and bananas warehouse where they hide among the mountains of burlap coffee bags. At one point Reed enters and yells at them that they will die unless they surrender and get inoculated.The weight challenged Raymond trying to keep up with Blackie is a source of shots that would be funny except for the circumstances.After Raymond is captured, in the final chase shots Blackie is on the run at the water level under the wooden docks, with the police hot on his tail. Trying to escape on a fruit boat headed towards South America the dirty and murderous rat, Blackie, is prevented from getting on board by the ship's rat shield causing him to end up in the water where he is eventually captured.The final shots symbolize that the emergency is over, as the exhausted Reed returns to his family.","
    
                    When a body is found in the New Orleans docks, it's pretty obvious that he died from gun shot wounds. The police surgeon notices that the man is also displaying other symptoms and Lt. Commander Clint Reed, a doctor with the U.S. Public Health Service, diagnoses a highly contagious disease, pneumonic plague. He tries to convince local officials to find everyone who may have been in contact with the dead man. The Mayor supports his efforts but many, including the police, are doubtful. Reed wants to avoid publicity so as not to panic the public. They have little information to go on - they don't know the dead man's identity - and Reed estimates they have 48 hours before disease begins to spread. With police Capt. Tom Warren going through the motions, Reed sets out to find the killers.

He takes charge, isolates everyone who touched the body, has the body cremated and starts inoculating the policemen and morgue technicians.At a hastily summoned emergency meeting with mayor Murray (H. Fowler, Jr.), police chief Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) and other authorities, Reed describes the potentially enormous consequences and deaths that could ensue from not finding those infected. Death occurs within four days of the onset of illness, and illness within about two days of contagious exposure. So they have a 48 hour window to try to find those exposed and prevent further illnesses by inoculations.Since the dead man was moved by his killers, the killers have been exposed and must be found. The search has to be done with a different excuse, otherwise the killers might leave town and potentially infect the whole nation. The secret must also be kept from the public, otherwise there would be a mass exodus that might spread the illness through a vast area.The mayor supports Reed, the rest go along very reluctantly. Warren objects that he has an impossible job because the murder victim is unidentified, but grumblingly he promises to do his best. Reed and Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other as they start off on their search for the killers.Warren orders a round up of all known petty criminals and suspects, who are shown a picture of the murder victim and are asked what they know. Reed is so involved an intense that he gets in the way of the police procedures, so he goes on his own to try other ways to identify the murder victim.Dr. Reed goes into the seamens hiring hall and offers a $50 reward to anyone who can identify the murder victim, to no avail. He senses there is a reluctance to give information, so he announces he will wait at a nearby café, Franks Place just in case anyone wants to talk to him. After some waiting, a girl comes to him and says she thinks she knows a boat owner who might have seen the unidentified victim. Reed follows her to a boat and the owner denies knowing anything. After some pushing, the owner says he also owns a café that is run by his wife and will ask his wife.At the café, the wife is consulted by her husband out of sight from Reed. She recognizes the man but refuses to admit it. She complains of having a headache, and she starts to cough.Meantime, Blackie, Raymond and Poldi have sensed that the police is after something important, and Blackie guesses that the dead man, who was Poldi's cousin, is much more important than one would guess from a merchant seaman, and imagine that Kochak had information about some treasure or drug stash.A scene in Blackies supposed legitimate business serves to define the characters of both Blackie and Raymond. Blackie argues with Raymond and his shrewish wife (Liswood), and shows Raymonds frantic subservience as he tries to pacify each, like some berserk pinball.There are brief scenes where Blackie's complex character is further developed. When a stunning prostitute asks Blackie for $100 (the equivalent of $1000 in 2010), he doesn't hesitate. When a little newspaper seller gives him some information, he insists on giving money to him, although, he doesn't want it. When a doctor tells him that the man he is trying to kill is sick and needs an expensive sanitarium, Blackie quickly offers the money. He may be a killer, but he sure is generous.The film intersperses small scenes that grab attention simply by making the characters and their little exchanges interesting. Like the Irish dwarf, for instance, who refuses to take payment for his favors, looking up at the towering Blackie, saying, ""No, Blackie, no."" And then after Blackie stuffs the bills into his sweater, he hobbles away backwards and saying, ""God bless ye, Blackie, God bless ye.""In the same vein, Reeds character is developed as struggles with his status as a nearly absentee dad, slaving away at a job that pays him poorly and barely managing to spend any time with his wife and son. The $50 reward he offers for information means the bill he was going to pay will have to wait.Blackie starts to suspect Poldi of holding out on him, since Kochak was Poldi's cousin, so Poldi disappears trying to get away from Blackie.Meantime, the wife of the café owner has been taken to a hospital, and dies from the plague. Her husband arrives, and Dr. Reed is able to extract more information due to the heavy guilt and grief. Kochak is identified as having arrived in a ship called the Queen of the Nile, which is still within reach of the authorities.The ship is boarded, and despite the Captains denials and lack of cooperation, Reed succeeds in questioning the crew, and finds that there had been a recent death on board. The interview of two Asian cooks aboard the Nile Queen is hilarious -- ""He cawr me dirty names and ask for Shishabob!"" Later, loudly proclaiming that the crew will start dying in just a few days, Reed succeeds in convincing the seamen to get inoculated. The captain yields as his crew starts to mutiny.During these searches, three times, Reed just misses meeting up with Raymond. The viewer is tantalized with both men in the same frame but unaware of the connection between them.The film has a subplot in which a news reporter, who wears his ""Freedom of Speech"" as a badge of honour, is shut down and locked away in a jail, to prevent him from publishing a story that might indeed trigger panic in the streets. This is a decision by the mayor at the urging of Reed that gives rise to a brief discussion of Constitutional rights.Eventually Blackie finds and interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband. Cat like, Blackie stalks his victim across the room, eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed, holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands. Meantime, Poldi's mother has summoned a nurse, whose entrance prevents Blackie from torturing the dying Poldi. She is aware of the seriousness of Poldi's condition, and refuses to leave. Blackie summons his own doctor, and the doctor expels the nurse, who manages to get messages to Reed about the situation. Were it not for the serendipitous perceptive nurse, Reed and Warren might still be looking for the killers.The doctor together with Blackie Fitch start to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed. Poldi is thrown down to his death, and an exciting chase follows. Blackie and Raymond hijack a van to flee, as they are being chased by Reed, Warren, and half the New Orleans Police, first in 1949 Ford police cars, then on foot after the van is surrounded. The two escaping killers try to throw off the pursuers in a coffee and bananas warehouse where they hide among the mountains of burlap coffee bags. At one point Reed enters and yells at them that they will die unless they surrender and get inoculated.The weight challenged Raymond trying to keep up with Blackie is a source of shots that would be funny except for the circumstances.After Raymond is captured, in the final chase shots Blackie is on the run at the water level under the wooden docks, with the police hot on his tail. Trying to escape on a fruit boat headed towards South America the dirty and murderous rat, Blackie, is prevented from getting on board by the ship's rat shield causing him to end up in the water where he is eventually captured.The final shots symbolize that the emergency is over, as the exhausted Reed returns to his family.

                    Luther Brooks, a black man, has just passed his Board exams to become a certified doctor. Rather than work under a black doctor as his family expects, Dr. Brooks decides to stay at County Hospital where he did his internship to do his junior residency under his mentor, Dr. Dan Wharton, a white man, the most supportive person in authority he has ever known. Dr. Brooks wants to continue working under Dr. Wharton if only because he is still somewhat unsure of his abilities despite being at the top of his class and having the full confidence of Dr. Wharton. His first assignment is working as the head of the prison ward, where criminal brothers, Johnny and Ray Biddle, are brought in, both shot in the leg after a botched robbery. Upon a quick examination and obtaining some information about Johnny, Dr. Brooks believes that the gunshot wound is only secondary to Johnny's bigger problem of a previously undiagnosed brain tumor. Alone in the room with Ray and Johnny, Dr. Brooks conducts a spinal tap on Johnny to confirm his diagnosis, during which Johnny dies. An unabashed racist, Ray accuses Dr. Brooks of purposefully killing Johnny. Dr. Brooks wants to have an autopsy conducted on Johnny to confirm his diagnosis and that he did not kill Johnny, something that requires family consent, which Ray or any of the the other Biddles is unwilling to provide if only not to cooperate with anything that would help Dr. Brooks. When news of what happened between Dr. Brooks and Johnny gets back to Johnny and Ray's primarily white, lower class, crime ridden and racist neighborhood of Beaver Canal, another full out race riot seems a real possibility. Other such riots are still fresh on the minds of many in the black community, such as with Lefty, an elevator operator at the hospital who sports a facial scar and whose sister is permanently wheelchair-bound from a previous riot. Caught between the two worlds is Edie Johnson, Johnny's ex-wife who too has deep seated racist views if only because of her background, yet hates the Biddles and what they represent. Beyond the issue of the autopsy, Ray is determined to ruin the life of Dr. Brooks, not because of Johnny's death but because he is an upwardly mobile black man.

                    Twelfth-century Lombardy lies under the iron heel of German overlord Count Ulrich 'The Hawk', but in the mountains, guerillas yet resist. Five years before our story, Ulrich stole away the pretty wife of young archer Dardo who, cynical rather than embittered, still has little interest in joining the rebels. But this changes when his son, too, is taken from him. The rest is lighthearted swashbuckling, plus romantic interludes with lovely hostage Anne.

                    Dardo is introduced as a wild mountain man who is a friend to all the villagers and loved by all the village women. The enemy of the people, Count Ulrich, arrives riding with his niece Anne and his wife. Dardo who is walking with his son, shows off his skill with an arrow by shooting the hawk that Ulrich has released after the village's many pigeons. Mountain law says that any hawk found in the hills is fair game, but a gentleman's hawk is an expensive beast and in revenge the count takes Dardo's son away. He justifies this because the lady who is his wife used to be Dardo's own and the boy should be raised in the castle. Dardo manages to rescue the boy and they try to escape across the rooftops, but Dardo is struck by an arrow and so the boy saves his father by running further on and making a great deal of noise to draw the soldiers away. The boy is captured and taken to the palace where we meet the Marchese, a young Italian gentleman in trouble for not paying his taxes. He introduces himself to Anne and asks for her hand in marriage. But he is driven out of the area tied to the back of his own cart which is carrying his belongings, along with his minstrel. The soldiers happen to ride with their captives through Dardo's territory and he and his rebels appear and rescue the Marchese. An argument over who should keep possession of the Marchese's goods ensues, but as the Marchese decides to join the band of rebels all is set to rights. He ends up serving as a stable boy in the ancient Roman temple in the mountains where the rebels live. To rescue his son, Dardo decides to invade the castle, and approaches his uncle Papa Bartoli to find help. Bartoli suggests Anne's maid who is one of Dardo's many lovers. The maid helps them in but they are unsuccessful in trying to rescue the boy, instead they find themselves in Lady Anne's apartment. Piccolo, Dardo's closest friend who is also mute suggests to Dardo through various hand gestures that they kidnap the Lady and use her as a bargaining tool against her uncle. They cover her with a pillowcase and carry her away. When she arrives at their secret hiding place the Marchese tries to persuade Dardo to treat her as a Lady deserves, to which Dardo replies that he will treat her as the Count's niece deserves and puts a metal collar and chain around her neck. At the sight of the collar she makes a run for it and leaps up onto Dardo's horse and rides away, but the horse is stopped by a whistle from its master and she falls to the ground. At first dismayed to find the Marchese has given himself over to such people she then tries to cajole him with the offer of her hand in marriage but the Marchese does not believe her. She then tries to talk to Piccolo asking him why he is so loyal to Dardo, Piccolo indicates that Dardo is a 'free spirit' and that is what is attractive about him, but he does not agree with the way he has tied her up. Still Anne cannot persuade him to let her go. She requests a bath and bathes in the nearby spring whilst Dardo stays behind a rock holding the end of the chain while they talk to each other. She requests a little more length so she can reach her clothes and uses it to wrap around a tree stump while she creeps round the rock with a large stone in order to knock him on the head with it. But Dardo is wise to her scheme and foils it. The rebels get the minstrel to write a message to the Count asking for an exchange of prisoners. The Marchese requests the honor of carrying it but Piccolo is chosen. His arrival at the palace is seen as an insult and so he is beaten and told to warn his master that instead of releasing his son, the Count will capture and execute his uncle unless the Lady is returned. Piccolo returns to the camp bruised and beaten but manages to indicate to the others that they should go to the village square where the scaffold has been erected. Dardo and the others race there and fight to rescue Papa Bartoli. Having rescued Papa Bartoli, the rebels return to the temple where a large rabble of villagers carrying torches arrive. As spokeswoman, Nonna Bartoli chides Dardo for causing trouble in the village and tells him that five more prisoners are now waiting to hang in Papa's place. But Papa Bartoli manages to persuade the angry villagers that Dardo has been acting for their sake and has made things better not worse, and that he would have been proud to die for his nephew's sake that night. Dardo and the rebels go to the town square to rescue the five new prisoners, Dardo gives himself up to save the others and is taken to the scaffold for execution in front of his son. But the executioner has been replaced by a friend and we see two hooks appear from under Dardo's tunic which take the brunt of the noose's force. Ulrich declares that the body can hang there until sunset and takes the rest of the rebels as prisoner - including the Marchese. The Marchese speaks to a guard asking him to alert the Count of his presence and that he wishes to discuss a proposal of marriage. Once in the great hall he informs the Count that the rebels are planning an attack the next day. The Count is incredulous as he doesn't believe anyone can lead them now Piccolo and Dardo are both dead, at which point the Marchese reveals that Dardo is alive. As a troupe of performing artists is announced at the castle gates, the two of them discuss their plans to foil the rebels plans and set up the Marchese as Anne's husband. Anne arrives at this point, unaware that Dardo is still alive, she still declares that she will not marry him. She runs to Dardo's Aunt's house to warn them of the Marchese's betrayal, while the men hide round the corner she passionately exhorts Nonna Bartoli to tell the remaining outcasts that the Marchese and the Count are celebrating the foiling of the rebels' plans with a group of performers at the castle, confessing as she does so that she is in love with Dardo. Nonna denies all knowledge of a rescue attempt and sends the Lady away. After she has gone, Dardo's aunt persuades him that the girl was telling the truth asking why Dardo who is so easily convinced that every woman loves him cannot believe that Anne does, perhaps because he loves her too? They decide that they must attack at once. Piccolo provides a plan for getting into the castle by posing as some of the acrobats, and the minstrel who waxes eloquent on the betrayal of his master provides them with clown costumes and a bear outfit. They arrive late at the castle and are almost not allowed in but they prove they are real clowns by balancing one on top of each other's shoulders. When they arrive, Dardo and Piccolo whose faces are heavily disguised by make up, meddle with the performances of the other acrobats to make the audience laugh. The Bear prevents the master of ceremonies from reaching them to stop the chaos, but eventually he realizes that the bear is not his own live one, the rebel in the bear costume then tells him to announce Dardo's act. The pair perform by balancing a pole on Piccolo's chin which Dardo climbs, this allows him to get on to the high window frame and then Piccolo climbs the pole to join him. As they take their bows they remove their disguises and all hell breaks loose as the Count realizes that Dardo has infiltrated the castle. Ulrich arrests all the performers as well, and the minstrel persuades the master of ceremonies to tell the troupe to fight for their freedom. A big battle ensues and Dardo and Piccolo slip away using the pole to balance their way through the kitchen roofs to the cells where they free the rebels and return to join the fight in the great hall. Anne, delighted to see her beloved alive and well, cries out above the din to Dardo telling him that the Count has gone after the boy. As Dardo runs through the battle the scene changes to a broad corridor in the castle where the Marchese stands between the Count and the boy's room. He tries to persuade Ulrich to take him along when they escape, but Dardo appears behind the Count at the other end of the corridor and the Count takes the opportunity to slip past the Marchese telling Dardo that the Marchese betrayed the outlaws and therefore must be stopped. Dardo however does not wish to fight the Marchese and tries to persuade him to stand aside. But the Marchese knows that his only escape lies with the Count, and so insists on fighting allowing the Count to disappear. They battle in the corridor until the chandelier is struck and the lights go out, there is a mad scuffle in the dark, and the Marchese is killed. After the fight Dardo finds his old wife dead by a knife in the back, and pursues the Count to where he is holding the boy captive at sword-point so that he can escape untouched. Dardo finds a bow and aims carefully, killing the Count and freeing his son. With a triumphant set of acrobatics along a series of bars high up on the castle he makes his way down to ground level and the crowd holding his son, they run to each other and then Dardo spies Ulrich's niece watching and smiling, they embrace in a romantic kiss as the end credits come up.

                    In true Hollywood fashion, Warner Bros. bought the film rights to Hemingway's novel ""To Have and Have Not,"" used the title for a follow-up to ""Casablanca"" with Humphrey Bogart, then filmed the plot as ""The Breaking Point"" with John Garfield. Bogart's fans probably would not have accepted him as Hemingway's anti-hero, which fit Garfield's persona perfectly.

                    Kim, a young boy living on his own on the streets of India, is actually the son of a British officer. He meets a lama, a holy man, and devotes himself to his tending. But when British administrators discover his birthright, he is placed in a British school. His nature, however, is opposed to the regimentation expected for the son of a British soldier, and he rebels. His familiarity with Indian life and his ability to pass as an Indian child allows him to function as a spy for the British as they attempt to thwart revolution and invasion of India. Rejoining his holy man, Kim (with the help of daring adventurer Mahbub Ali) takes on a dangerous mission.

                    Naive 19-year old Marie Allen is incarcerated for being an accessory to a minor robbery committed by her husband Tom, who was killed during the robbery. The prison, populated primarily by hardened career criminals, is run by warden Ruth Benton, who is trying to reform the penal system by running a humanistic prison. However she is at odds with sadistic matron Evelyn Harper, who is in charge of Marie's cell block. Evelyn runs her cell block the way she wants despite Benton's directives, and takes bribes from the charge with the most money to offer. Marie's time is rough, as she slowly learns that playing by the legitimate rules will get her nowhere, especially with Harper operating by her own sadistic rules. In addition, Marie is pregnant and has little to no support outside the prison walls to support her and her expanding family. Marie ultimately changes to a more hardened inmate after a series of events including her baby being taken away from her, the suicide of a fellow model inmate following a parole denial, and Marie's own parole denial for circumstances beyond her control. Marie changes for good after being placed in solitary confinement due to an altercation with Harper. Although Harper does eventually get her comeuppance, Marie decides, against the sage advice of lifer Millie Lewis, to take the most expedient way out by joining forces with the inmate with criminal connections on the outside. Despondent Benton knows that Marie will unfortunately be back behind bars.

She is two months pregnant and finds herself in the company of both petty and hardened criminals. With the help of a few inmates she quickly learns the inmate pecking order and takes the advice of the kindly prison Superintendent, Ruth Benton, to follow the rules and aim to get parole at the end of her first year. Her biggest obstacle is the matron in charge of her section, Evelyn Harper, an evil and sadistic overseer who goes out of her way to make everyone miserable. When her mother refuses to take care of her newborn child, it goes into State care and when she is refused parole, she hardens and is destined to a life of crime.

                    An everyman plays several roles in this film. In his role as narrator of the story presented, he is aware that he is in a movie, he often breaking that fourth wall. In that role, he spends much of his time operating a carousel to match the story that he is about to tell which has at its core a round. He also dons several, what he calls ""disguises"", inserting himself in the story often acting as the puppet-master to manipulate the characters to do what is truly in their hearts, and to move the story along to ensure that it doesn't get stalled by the stray activities of any one character. The story, which takes place in 1900 Vienna, is about the pursuit of love. The narrator will not feel that the story is complete until the circle, or the round, has been achieved. The story begins with Léocadie, a prostitute, negotiating, on the streets, the terms of her potential encounter with Franz, a soldier; who, in turn, has a chance encounter at a dance hall with Marie, a chambermaid; who, in turn, meets, in a new working assignment, Alfred, the amorous yet shy on the surface son of her employers; who, in turn, has an on-going clandestine relationship with Emma Breitkopf, a society matron; who, in turn, embarks in ""pillow talk"" about their relationship with her long standing well-off husband, Charles Breitkopf; who, in turn, has dinner in a private room of a restaurant with Anna, a working class girl; who, in turn, has a hotel encounter described by Charles as their fantasy next encounter, but instead with Robert Kuhlenkampf, a poet; who, in turn, goes backstage at a theater to meet up with a longtime friend, Charlotte, an actress; who, in turn, is visited in her boudoir by a fan who saw her perform, he a count; who in turn, on a drunken spree, falls into the arms of a prostitute named Léocadie. In this one regard, the narrator is satisfied in that the circle of love of has been completed.

At various air bases throughout the world, USAir Force planes and crews are directed to fly to the Frankfurt/Main US air base to help supply West Berlin with food, coal, and other necessities. The film concentrates on two American sergeants who know each other, Danny McCullough (Montgomery Clift), and Hank Kowalski (Paul Douglas) as they fly in from Honolulu.Hank, Danny and others in their group arrive in Frankfurt/Main air base and are assigned temporary quarters there, and soon begin to shuttle from Frankfurt into Berlin. The procedures in the cockpit and the landing descents into runways in the heart of a built up city are shown in some detail. Danny is in charge of cockpit checklists for the pilots who are flying. Hanks job is related to radar control of the approaches to land. Some sequences explain how the approach control works.For several months, they are confined to the airport while in Berlin. When Danny and others in the crew arrive in Berlin in what is flight number 100,000 of the airlift, the German authorities in the city welcome them in a special surprise ceremony that involves an extensive honor guard parade, and souvenir gifts presented by a municipal leader, a young boy, and comely war widow Frederika Burkhardt (Cornell Borchers). A newsman covering the event encourages Frederika and Danny to kiss after the presentation, to get good pictures for his story.Danny is much taken with Frederika, and after a brief chat gets an address for her and the phone number or a neighbor, where he might reach her if he ever gets permission to visit the city.Motivated by his attraction for Frederika, Danny makes arrangements for public relations activities with the newsman as a way of getting blocks of time to spend in Berlin outside the airport. Meantime, Hank has been assigned ground work at Tempelhof.The first time Danny gets time in Berlin outside Tempelhof, the camera follows him as he tries to find Frederika, and this gives an excuse for showing scenes of streets and avenues demolished by the war, of people surviving as best they can, and some of the black market activity.Danny finds Frederika gathering up rubble to recycle bricks with a crew of women working under a male foreman. He can only talk with her briefly to make a date for later. Later, Danny gives out cigarettes, and paint spills on his uniform. Federica takes his clothes to a cleaner, he takes a bath and borrows clothes from the neighbor..The neighbor with a phone is Stieber (O. E. Hasse). He has a phone because he is a spy for the Soviets, who is assigned the task of counting and identifying the airplanes that land at Tempelhof, since the apartment has a window overlooking the approach path. Stieber explains that he documents the flights for the Soviets, who do not trust the official information given in the newspapers. Since the official information is correct, he purposefully miscounts the planes downward in his reports so the Soviets keep him at his job.The cleaning shop closes early, as the owner has a family emergency that takes him to the Soviet sector. Frederika and Danny take a subway to find the owner and retrieve a key. On the ride, they cross into the Soviet sector and there is an inspection for contraband. A man carrying dozens of coffee bags under his coat manages to divert the attention of the inspectors by denouncing a fellow passenger for having ONE coffee bag under her hat. After failing to retrieve the uniform, they meet Hank and Gerda (Bruni Lobel) in a restaurant with live entertainment. Hank orders Gerda around, answers for her, while giving his opinion that Germans are too submissive to fathers, and that prepared their psychology to follow Hitler. Danny points out that Hank is treating Gerda just like that. Hank argues back but changes his attitude toward Gerda. He tries to explain democracy to her.Hank does not hide his anti German attitudes. He demands that Frederika give an account of her background, and she claims that her husband had disappeared after being arrested by the SS, and that her father had been a somewhat outspoken anti Nazi.While at the restaurant, police come in checking identity papers. Danny doesnt have any, but manages to escape the check by pretending to be one of the entertainment jazz trio, which with him becomes a quartet.At the restaurant, Hank sees a man at another table and he seems familiar. As the man leaves, he thinks he recognizes him because he has a limp, and follows him out. After following him for some distance through areas deserted because of war damage, he calls him Felix. The man pretends not to speak English but Hank is sure he was the guard that tormented and beat Hank while he was a war prisoner, and exacts revenge by turnabout. Danny, Gerda and Frederika catch up with Hank and try to stop the beating. As Military Police arrive, and Danny runs with Frederika into the Soviet sector by crossing the Brandenburg gate. At the Soviet check point Frederika claims that Danny is her husband. At first they are believed, and they walk on, but other Soviet sector guards catch up and try to arrest them. A crowd gathers, guards from the British and French sectors intervene, the location of the borders is disputed, and in the confusion Frederika and Danny get away.In the apartment Danny wakes after 3 in the morning. Frederika has electricity from 3 to 5 AM and is ironing his uniform. In their chat, she realizes that Danny loves her.Danny successfully returns to duty even though his uniform has shrunk. Some time later Hank shows Danny documents showing that Frederika has lied, that her husband had volunteered early into the SS. Frederika admits she lied, but she explains their dire needs to survive, to make him sympathetic. At first, Danny decides to end the relationship, realizing that Frederika is capable of deceit. As he walks away in a street of ruined houses, a section of wall falls down. However, he returns some time later.As he arrives back to the Frankfurt base, a group of sailors from the Navy are also arriving to help in the airlift. A comical sequence follows in which the Army guys sing the Navy song and vice versa, in good natured rivalry ribbing.At the base, Danny asks permission to marry a German citizen, and his commanding officer explains the rules and regulations and time frames. Because of the success of the air lift at that point, replacements are coming in, there is a good chance that Danny would be sent back soon, so there is time schedule pressure on his marriage arrangements.In a comic relief sequence, Hank tries to explain America and its values to Gerda, how people of different nationalities live in New York City peacefully, and how Americans are not persecuted or put in prison for expressing criticism of their government.We see how the neighbor Stieber has become suspicious because Frederika receives letters mailed from the USA, and opens them first, even though letters from Danny have arrived simultaneously.Eventually Danny learns he scheduled to leave on the next Friday. Danny talks with Frederika through a fence of the airport compound, and they make arrangements to hurry the paperwork so they can marry before his departure back to the USA.Complications arise because of weather, as fog forces cancellation of flights. Danny gets on a plane that departs in a short moment of less fog, but then has a burning engine that triggers an emergency landing. This gives an excuse for a sequence that shows how radar radar is used for foggy landings, as Hank and gives the plane landing instructions by radio. They land safely.Eventually after much frantic running around, Danny finds Frederika in Berlin and makes the appointment to marry. Hank and Gerda are to be the witnesses. At the last minute, Gerda argues with Hank about her rights and throws him out of her apartment, but he changes tone and attitude and she relents. Meantime, Frederika asks an emergency favor from Stieber, to mail an important letter. Stieber, suspicious, opens it and reads how she plans to meet another man, a man she loves, in America. As Hank and Gerda wait at the office where the marriage would take place, Danny arrives first, and then after Frederika show up, Danny comments that maybe she would like to go to St. Louis instead of St. Paul. He has the incriminating letter and lets Hank read it. Danny walks away. Gerda follows him and says she has decided to stay in Germany to help make it better. Hank informs Danny that he has been reassigned to permanent duty, and he now speaks fluent German. They say goodbye.An airplane departs in the partially cleared fog. A last image shows a bunch of crows walking on the ground. This is a reference to an earlier comment by Hank, that the US Air Force flies even when birds stay on the ground.","
    
                    In 1948, the Soviet Union blockades the Allied sectors of Berlin to bring the entire city under their control. A semi-documentary about the resulting Berlin Airlift gives way to stories of two fictitious U.S. Air Force participants: Sgt.

Danny McCullough, whose pursuit of an attractive German war widow gives him a crash course in the seamy side of occupied Berlin.

                    In post-WWII Berlin, the Russians have set up blockades on all ground and water transportation routes in and out of the city in an effort to starve the western sectors of the city to force who were their Allied partners in the war out. As such, those Allied partners, with the support of the German citizenry in Berlin, decide to airlift supplies in and out of the western sectors of the city in not bowing down to the Russians' force. Two of the enlisted US Air Force airmen taking part in the airlift mission, which will continue indefinitely as long as the Russians have set up the blockades, are friends Sgt. Danny MacCullough, who is part of an air crew flying those supplies from Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt to Tempelhof Field in the western sector of Berlin, and M/Sgt. Hank Kowalski, a ground control approach (GCA) operator based at Tempelhof. Hank's respectful request to be excused from this assignment is denied, his strong anti-German feelings stemming from his time in a German POW camp during the war which are still fresh in his mind. While in Berlin, Hank, however, is not averse to satisfying his personal needs in beginning a casual relationship with a fraulein named Gerda, whose naivety is borne solely out of not being exposed to the world, especially as the Nazis propagated lies to the German citizenry. Because of the in and out nature of the flights, Danny is not given the opportunity to get into Berlin to explore at all. His want to do so increases when he meets at Tempelhof Frederica Burkhardt, a German war widow whose enlisted husband was killed in the war. Danny seizes upon an opportunity he probably would not have partaken in if not for the benefit of getting into Berlin proper and seeing Frederica. In addition to Frederica, Hank and Gerda, who collectively get into one adventure after another due to the political situation of Berlin, Danny is able to see much of what is truly the life of Berliners through the eyes of one of Frederica's neighbors, Herr Stieber, a German national who is more than willing to help the Russians in acting a Russian spy as he knows the information he is providing them is virtually useless. Through all these encounters, Danny and Frederica fall in love and want to get married. There are many obstacles in their way, including from Hank, whose anti-German feelings extend to not fully trusting Frederica.

Since the official information is correct, he purposefully miscounts the planes downward in his reports so the Soviets keep him at his job.
The cleaning shop closes early, as the owner has a family emergency that takes him to the Soviet sector. Frederika and Danny take a subway to find the owner and retrieve a key. On the ride, they cross into the Soviet sector and there is an inspection for contraband. A man carrying dozens of coffee bags under his coat manages to divert the attention of the inspectors by denouncing a fellow passenger for having ONE coffee bag under her hat. After failing to retrieve the uniform, they meet Hank and Gerda (Bruni Lobel) in a restaurant with live entertainment. Hank orders Gerda around, answers for her, while giving his opinion that Germans are too submissive to fathers, and that prepared their psychology to follow Hitler. Danny points out that Hank is treating Gerda just like that. Hank argues back but changes his attitude toward Gerda. He tries to explain democracy to her.Hank does not hide his anti German attitudes. He demands that Frederika give an account of her background, and she claims that her husband had disappeared after being arrested by the SS, and that her father had been a somewhat outspoken anti Nazi.While at the restaurant, police come in checking identity papers. Danny doesnt have any, but manages to escape the check by pretending to be one of the entertainment jazz trio, which with him becomes a quartet.At the restaurant, Hank sees a man at another table and he seems familiar. As the man leaves, he thinks he recognizes him because he has a limp, and follows him out. After following him for some distance through areas deserted because of war damage, he calls him Felix. The man pretends not to speak English but Hank is sure he was the guard that tormented and beat Hank while he was a war prisoner, and exacts revenge by turnabout. Danny, Gerda and Frederika catch up with Hank and try to stop the beating. As Military Police arrive, and Danny runs with Frederika into the Soviet sector by crossing the Brandenburg gate. At the Soviet check point Frederika claims that Danny is her husband. At first they are believed, and they walk on, but other Soviet sector guards catch up and try to arrest them. A crowd gathers, guards from the British and French sectors intervene, the location of the borders is disputed, and in the confusion Frederika and Danny get away.In the apartment Danny wakes after 3 in the morning. Frederika has electricity from 3 to 5 AM and is ironing his uniform. In their chat, she realizes that Danny loves her.Danny successfully returns to duty even though his uniform has shrunk. Some time later Hank shows Danny documents showing that Frederika has lied, that her husband had volunteered early into the SS. Frederika admits she lied, but she explains their dire needs to survive, to make him sympathetic. At first, Danny decides to end the relationship, realizing that Frederika is capable of deceit. As he walks away in a street of ruined houses, a section of wall falls down. However, he returns some time later.As he arrives back to the Frankfurt base, a group of sailors from the Navy are also arriving to help in the airlift. A comical sequence follows in which the Army guys sing the Navy song and vice versa, in good natured rivalry ribbing.At the base, Danny asks permission to marry a German citizen, and his commanding officer explains the rules and regulations and time frames. Because of the success of the air lift at that point, replacements are coming in, there is a good chance that Danny would be sent back soon, so there is time schedule pressure on his marriage arrangements.In a comic relief sequence, Hank tries to explain America and its values to Gerda, how people of different nationalities live in New York City peacefully, and how Americans are not persecuted or put in prison for expressing criticism of their government.We see how the neighbor Stieber has become suspicious because Frederika receives letters mailed from the USA, and opens them first, even though letters from Danny have arrived simultaneously.Eventually Danny learns he scheduled to leave on the next Friday. Danny talks with Frederika through a fence of the airport compound, and they make arrangements to hurry the paperwork so they can marry before his departure back to the USA.Complications arise because of weather, as fog forces cancellation of flights. Danny gets on a plane that departs in a short moment of less fog, but then has a burning engine that triggers an emergency landing. This gives an excuse for a sequence that shows how radar radar is used for foggy landings, as Hank and gives the plane landing instructions by radio. They land safely.Eventually after much frantic running around, Danny finds Frederika in Berlin and makes the appointment to marry. Hank and Gerda are to be the witnesses. At the last minute, Gerda argues with Hank about her rights and throws him out of her apartment, but he changes tone and attitude and she relents. Meantime, Frederika asks an emergency favor from Stieber, to mail an important letter. Stieber, suspicious, opens it and reads how she plans to meet another man, a man she loves, in America. As Hank and Gerda wait at the office where the marriage would take place, Danny arrives first, and then after Frederika show up, Danny comments that maybe she would like to go to St. Louis instead of St. Paul. He has the incriminating letter and lets Hank read it. Danny walks away. Gerda follows him and says she has decided to stay in Germany to help make it better. Hank informs Danny that he has been reassigned to permanent duty, and he now speaks fluent German. They say goodbye.An airplane departs in the partially cleared fog. A last image shows a bunch of crows walking on the ground. This is a reference to an earlier comment by Hank, that the US Air Force flies even when birds stay on the ground.

"47","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042367/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In a Paris theater in 1640, a play begins before a fairly full house. After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (José Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clichéd comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose. Le Bret suggests they go out to eat, but Cyrano says he has no money left, as all he had was in the bag he threw at the theater manager -- a costly grand gesture that he does not regret.A beautiful fruit seller (Elena Verdugo) overhears Cyrano, offers him food and wine from a buffet prepared for the theater patrons, and mentions her admiration for his poetry and bravery. But he refuses charity food, accepting only a grape, a sip of water and half a macaroon. This is his way of acknowledging her regard while emphasizing his disdain for money.Le Bret points out to Cyrano that the girl's admiration indicates he has real possibilities of being loved despite his nose. He also tells him that Roxane watched his duel with an excited fascination that surely was encouraging.Roxane's servant reenters to arrange a meeting between Roxane and Cyrano the next morning after church. Cyrano, becoming bold, says he will wait at the pastry shop run by his friend Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan).At this point, pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau approaches Cyrano for help. Ragueneau has been warned that De Guiche, whom Ragueneau has mocked in published poetry, has hired a hundred ruffians to give him a beating that night, and he asks to sleep at Cyrano's. Cyrano scoffs at the threat, promising Ragueneau he will escort him safely home. The mob of ruffians appears as Cyrano walks with Ragueneau on a dark and deserted street and Cyrano alone routs them, wounding many and killing eight.The next day at the pastry shop, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince). She has never even spoken to Christian, but wants Cyrano to protect him. Cyrano hides his devastation and promises to help.At a gathering of the regiment, rookie recruit Christian de Neuvillette is being made fun of by the others. Christian asks the captain how he can establish himself, and the captain answers he must not accept mocking and must somehow demonstrate his valor. Christian is also advised never to mention the word nose or anything related to noses when Cyrano is present, or face the consequences. Moments later, Cyrano arrives to tell about his routing of the hundred ruffians hired to beat up Ragueneau. Christian, from the sidelines, interrupts the telling by adding the word nose whenever he can work it into the story, as in ""It was so dark you couldn't see . . . BEYOND YOUR NOSE.""At the first such interruption, Cyrano stops and menacingly asks who that new face might be, and he is told the young man's name is Christian de Neuvillette. Cyrano reins in his increasing anger through repeated interruptions, finally ordering everyone in the regiment out while he talks to Christian.Cyrano reveals that he knows that Christian is in love with Roxane, that he is Roxane's cousin, and that he talks to her often, whereupon Christian profusely apologizes for his recent insults. Cyrano decides to help in Christian's wooing of Roxane after Christian admits that while he is not shy or tongue-tied when talking to men, he becomes hopelessly inept when he tries to talk to Roxane. Cyrano knows words of love and starts to coach Christian systematically.Meantime, De Guiche consults his uncle, Cardinal Richelieu (Edgar Barrier), as to how to punish Cyrano for duels and fighting, which had been forbidden by Richelieu. The cardinal tells him that when a man is as talented as Cyrano with both words and sword, exceptions should be made so his talents can serve the state. De Guiche accepts the advice.Cyrano composes love letters to Roxane, which are sent and read as though they were from Christian. She finds them irresistible. Christian talks to Roxane using memorized and practiced phrases supplied by Cyrano, and she falls ever more deeply in love. Cyrano continues his own visits to Roxane, during which they talk mostly about her love for Christian. De Guiche, meantime, has not given up his suit for Roxane's hand, and is much annoyed at meeting Cyrano at Roxane's, although he follows Richelieu's advice and makes no trouble.Later, Christian decides he wants no more help and tries to speak to Roxane on his own, in her garden. Roxane rebuffs him in short order and reenters her house. Cyrano, who had been watching from behind some bushes, comes to his rescue, whispering words to him that Christian speaks loudly to her from beneath her window. When she admires his newly found words but is puzzled by how hesitantly he speaks, Cyrano takes over completely, able to pull off the deceit because of the darkness and because he is beneath the balcony. At the point that Roxane is totally won over by Cyrano's eloquence, a friar (Francis Pierlot) arrives bearing a letter from De Guiche for Roxane. De Guiche insists on marrying her that night, as his regiment is ordered to join the siege at Arras and must leave the next morning. He will be arriving soon after the friar.Roxane reads the sealed letter aloud but changes its content, telling the friar he is sent to immediately perform a rite marrying her to Christian, and as this is somewhat irregular, one hundred and twenty gold coins will be given to his monastery.Cyrano stays in the garden to delay De Guiche until the marriage ceremony is over. Cyrano intercepts de Guiche as he arrives and pretends, in a long conversation with detailed technical explanations, that he has just fallen from the moon. Furious at finding Roxane married, De Guiche, who is Christian's commander, orders him to join his unit immediately for the siege against the Spanish armies. Roxane begs Cyrano to get Christian to write her a letter every day, and he promises.The siege becomes complicated, as the besieging French are in turn encircled by Spaniards. It is Cyrano who writes letters to the fair Roxane, but in Christian's name. De Guiche's heroism in battle wins the admiration of Cyrano, who had previously despised him, so the enmity between these two evolves into respect. To send the letters every day, Cyrano must risk his life to cross the no-man's-land between the opposing armies.Learning that a convoy will carry food and supplies through the battle zone to the besieged French forces, Roxane in disguise stows away on a wagon and thus arrives to visit her husband in the camp. They embrace joyfully, and she thanks him profusely for the daily letters that she has received from him, telling him that she is now more than ever in love with the great soul she knows from the words he writes.Christian did not know about the letters, so he realizes she has fallen in love with Cyrano's words. He pretends to be concerned about what might happen if he were to become seriously wounded in the upcoming battle -- crippled, perhaps; disfigured, maybe. What if he were to become ugly? She radiantly proclaims none of that would make any difference.Christian leaves Roxane for a moment and goes to talk with Cyrano, reporting Roxane's proclamations of love despite ugliness or physical disfigurement. He gets his rival to promise to tell Roxane the truth about the words and letters, and let her decide between them.Before the opportunity arises, an attack begins, a major battle ensues, Christian volunteers for a dangerous mission and is brought back fatally wounded. Cyrano deceives Roxane, so Roxane tells Christian that she knows everything, and as he dies in her arms, Christian thinks he is the chosen one. Roxane finds a last unsent letter in his pocket and decides to carry it forever in a locket near her heart.Fourteen years pass. Roxane has entered a life of seclusion in a convent. Cyrano visits her once a week, at three o'clock on Saturdays, telling her news about the world outside and the gossip of the court, but never mentioning his feelings. De Guiche, who has also continued to visit her, has overheard a courtier plotting against Cyrano because he has continued to write satirical articles mocking the nobility. He warns Roxane that Cyrano's life may be in danger.One night, Cyrano is lured into an ambush and run down by a speeding wagon. Near death, acting against the doctor's orders, he hides his injuries and goes the next afternoon to keep his weekly appointment with Roxane.As he is received into the courtyard, he banters with Sister Marthe (Virginia Christine). When he gives her permission to pray for him, she says she did not wait for his permission.He is injured and weak, stumbling a bit, but he refuses all help, and just sits to visit, first making a few jokes about trivial events at court. He asks Roxane to let him read Christian's last letter, and she hands it to him, apologizing that it is wrinkled and faded and blurred with a few tears. He pretends to read, but he actually recites the letter from memory, as it is a farewell to her from someone who might be dying shortly.Listening to his voice and words, she first feels a special thrill at how eloquently he reads, but then recognizes the voice as the one she heard from her balcony many years before. As she turns to look, Roxane realizes that he is reciting from memory a letter that supposedly he has never seen before. It dawns on her it was Cyrano all the time: all the letters, all the words. She says, ""It was you!""But it is too late. Cyrano slips into delirium and gets up with a last bit of energy. Refusing to die sitting down, he takes his sword in hand for the upcoming battle against Death, challenging Death with his final words, which sum up his life: ""my white plume.""Cyrano falls dead, and Roxane is left to mourn the death of a great love for the second time.","
    
                    France, 1640: Cyrano, the charismatic swordsman-poet with the absurd nose, hopelessly loves the beauteous Roxane; she, in turn, confesses to Cyrano her love for the handsome but tongue-tied Christian. The chivalrous Cyrano sets up with Christian an innocent deception, with tragic results. Much cut from the play, but dialogue not rewritten.

In order to pursue the three brothers into Texas, Hollister fakes his own death in a staged gunfight with his friend Wild Bill Hickock. He then befriends Martin Weatherby, the newly appointed U.S. Marshal to Dallas, an affable, but not very experienced lawman, who agrees to let Hollister assume his identity. The eldest of the Marlowe brothers, Will, masquerades as a law-abiding real estate dealer while feigning righteous indignation over the brutal acts of lawlessness and violence visited on the honest citizens of Dallas by his sociopathic brothers, Cullen and Bryant. (Their parents were evidently fond of the renowned poet William Cullen Bryant). When Hollister becomes a rival for the affections of Weatherby's aristocratic fiancee Tonia Robles, Martin wonders whether he should let Blayde know that he's been pardoned and free to marry her after the Marlowes have been defeated.

                    Secretary Joyce Willecombe grows suspicious of two men boarding her train and is referred to 'Tough Willy' Calhoun, head of the Union Station police. The all-seeing, no-nonsense Calhoun is initially skeptical, but the men (who escape) prove to be involved in a kidnap case. Calhoun calls in equally tough police Inspector Donnelly, but the ruthless kidnapper's precision planning stays one jump ahead of them. Most of the action centers around bustling Union Station.

Indeed, they have kidnapped Lorna Murchison, the blind daughter of Joyce's wealthy employer, and are holding Lorna ransom for $100,000. As the crooks use bustling and aways crowded Union Station as the drop-off point for the ransom, ""tough"" Lt. Bill Calhoun, Chief of Police at Union Station, leads the investigation along with equally pragmatic Inspector Donnelly of the city police. Joyce and Bill are two of only a few people who can identify the two men. The investigators use this limited knowledge to gather more evidence as to the crooks' hideout and hopefully a still living Lorna. Meanwhile, Joe Beacom, a penny-ante ex-con and mastermind behind the kidnapping, won't let anything or anyone, including his accomplices, stop him from getting the prized $100,000.

Larry Blair, who has had a thing for Nanette in the past because of her wealth but she who will not speak to him now over an unpaid loan, has the rights to Jimmy's latest songs for a Broadway show in which Jimmy and Tommy have major roles. Larry is looking for investors in this difficult time immediately after the stock market crash. He's afraid that his stormy personal relationship with her will prevent Nanette, one of the few remaining wealthy people he knows, from investing as she has done in the past. But when Jimmy suggests that Nanette take over the lead role from Larry's current girlfriend Bea Darcy, Nanette believes this move could be her big show business break and promises to invest the $25,000 needed to put on the show. Unbeknown to Nanette, she and her financier uncle, J. Maxwell Bloomhaus, are currently broke as Max made the decision to convert all their government bonds into stock, which were hit in the crash. But based on a conversation that Max had with their lawyer, William Early, who told Max that he could have saved a lot of money by not saying ""yes"" so often especially to hair-brained schemes, Nanette bets her uncle that she be allowed to cash in $25,000 of her bonds (which no longer exist) if she answers ""no"" to every question asked of her over the next 48 hours. Nanette's faithful but wisecracking secretary Pauline Hastings is to act as the official judge to make sure Nanette doesn't answer ""yes"" during that time. Uncle Max does whatever he can to make Nanette lose the bet if only because he wouldn't be able to fulfill his side of the bet if he loses. Nanette's ""no""'s cause more than a few misunderstandings, not only with respect to putting on the show, but also with her budding romance with Jimmy. In the end, even if Nanette wins the bet, will it be worth it if she loses the show and/or Jimmy, especially as the money no longer exists?

That all changes when leaving work one day from her office job at a mill, Ann is followed by a man. Ann, scared and thus unable to notice anything about the man beyond the scar on his neck and his brown leather jacket, is raped by him. Among the health related issues associated with the attack is Ann's visible emotional shock. As the more physical aspects of Ann heal and as she tries to get on with her life over time, Ann still feels the emotional shock and stigma associated with the incident, where she believes that everything about her is a walking billboard as ""THE rape victim"" and as every little thing around her steers her mind back toward the attack. Unable to cope and no longer wanting to get married - not to Jim or anyone else, ever - Ann decides to run away to Los Angeles, not telling anyone that she is leaving. En route, Ann encounters Tom and Madge Harrison, owners of an orange grove, and Reverend Bruce Ferguson - Doc to his friends - who try to help this stranger who they can only see is a frightened young woman. Ann does not tell them her real name or about the rape. The question becomes whether Doc and the Harrisons' compassion can help Ann deal directly with the rape and thus capture of her attacker, and/or come to emotional terms with the rape and thus be able to move on with her life, regardless of if she tells them the truth.

One of the more devout of the parishioners was Mrs. Martin Lynn, who just passed away. Her son, Martin Lynn Jr., is a hard working, conscientious young man, who feels the church has done his family no good. Unable to pay for a lavish funeral for his mother which he feels he owes her, unable to convince the church to do so on his behalf, and unforgiving of the fact that the church would not sanction even a burial for his father who committed suicide years ago, Martin, in a fit of violence, kills the seemingly unsympathetic senior parish priest, Father Kirkman, who admitted that he lost touch with his parishioners in his later years. Following the killing, Martin, not wanting to implicate his loving girlfriend Julie in the crime, tries desperately to find anyone else to help him arrange the lavish funeral. As he is denied at every turn, he begins to alienate those around him. The only person who can at least assist and who Martin hasn't alienated is the parish's junior priest, Father Roth. When Father Roth discovers through other means that Martin killed Father Kirkman, Father Roth prays that Martin will do what's best for his immortal soul.

In ""The Verger,"" a church verger of seventeen years is fired by his new straight-laced vicar when it's discovered that he cannot read or write. Forced to make life-altering decisions, the life-long bachelor proposes to his landlady and becomes an entrepreneur. In ""Mr. Know-All"" an obnoxiously pushy and irrepressibly boorish dealer in jewelry alienates all his fellow passengers on an ocean cruise despite his cheerful nature and generosity, but later is sensitive enough to realize that sacrificing his ego at a key moment is important to a woman's happiness. ""The Sanatorium"" revolves around the lives of tuberculosis patients at an exclusive Scottish sanatorium including a pair of doomed lovers who choose quality over quantity of life.

As she has missed her bus to Kaminoyu and as Ichirô is heading there anyway, he offers her a ride to the resort where both of them are staying and which is largely empty as it is the off season. As he visits her in her room solely as a measure of friendship and camaraderie, they are unaware that a paparazzo working for scandal sheet Amour has taken a photograph of the two of them together on her balcony. Hori, Amour's publisher, decides to print the photograph along with an accompanying salacious story on what could have happened based on the photograph, but which is a total fabrication. Hori has done such before with other celebrities, never having been sued as he believes his subjects either like the publicity or are too busy or scared to take action. A libel suit he feels will only increase circulation. He is nonetheless surprised when Ichirô does sue, Ichirô's action regardless of what Miyako decides. Ichirô decides to hire as his lawyer Otokichi Hiruta, despite Hiruta coming across as an ambulance chaser and shyster. Ichirô makes this hiring decision after meeting Hiruta's bedridden daughter, Miyako, who suffers from tuberculosis and whose inherent goodness Ichirô believes cannot have come out of anywhere but her parents. The resulting case not only becomes about Ichirô and Miyako's rights and their belief that justice will and should prevail, but also about Hiruta whose person and soul will have to face the consequences of his own actions.

                    The murder of gangster Nick Prenta touches off an investigation of mysterious socialite Lorna Hansen Forbes, who seems to have no past, and has now disappeared. In flashback, we see the woman's anonymous roots; her poor working-class marriage, which ends in tragedy and her determination to find ""better things.""

                    A land surveyor discovers the body of a notorious gangster out in the Palm Springs desert, setting off a police investigation that turns up one very surprising fact. The gangster was somehow connected to the New York socialite, Lorna Hansen Forbes. Where is she? The last place they would think to look is near an oil field in the modest home of two old folks. It seems the mysterious Miss Forbes has a secret past; these poor old folks are her parents. In a flashback, we learn that Miss Forbes was once Ethel Whitehead, a poor wife who wanted something more out of life and abandoned her husband to get it. A new career selling cigars in an office lobby leads to something better: modeling dresses. That leads to her meeting a meek accountant. And he becomes the first rung on her ladder to success, which means climbing down into the underworld and meeting rich gangsters, who are able to give her everything she has ever wanted - or thought she did.

                    The film dramatizes about a dozen vignettes from the life of St. Francis and his early followers - starting with their return in the rain to Rivotorlo from Rome when the Pope blessed their Rule and ending with their dispersal to preach. The unconnected chapters are like parables, some with a moral. The slight and comic Ginepro returns naked to St. Mary's of the Angels, having given away his tunic, but not his ricotta. The aged Giovanni shouts and holds onto his cape; the beatific St. Clair pays a visit. Humble Francis doubts his leadership, hugs a leper, and sends his brothers spinning, dizzy, and smiling into the world. This brotherhood is infused with whimsy as well as belief.

                    Columbia's 43rd serial finds Lex Luthor, secretly the Atom Man, blackmailing the city of Metropolis by threatening to destroy the entire community. Perry White, editor of ""The Daily Planet"", assigns Lois Lane, Jimmy Olson and Clark Kent/Superman to cover the story. Luthor invents a number of deadly devices to plague the city, including a disintegrating machine which can reduce people to their basic atoms and reassemble them in another place. But Superman manages to thwart each scheme. Since Kryptonite can rob Superman of his powers, Luthor decides to create a synthetic Kryptonite and putters about obtaining the necessary ingredients: plutonium, radium and the undefined 'etc.'(in order to keep viewers from trying this at home). Luthor places the Kryptonite at the launching of a ship, with Superman in attendance. He is exposed to the Kryptonite and passes out. Superman is taken off in an ambulance driven by Luthor's henchmen, and he is now under the control of Luthor. Superman is placed in a device, a lever is pulled, and the Man of Steel vanishes into ""The Empty Doom."" With eight chapters remaining, the odds are high he will return. Most of chapter 7 is a repeat of the origin story from chapter 1 of Columbia's first ""Superman"" serial, and this serial also finds a way to work in stock footage from Ken Maynard's 1936 ""Avenging Waters,"" minus ol' Ken and his hoss Tarzan.

                    A Christmas Wish is a heartwarming holiday classic about a New York family (led by Durante) who is down on their luck at Christmas time. Shortly before Christmas, they move into a ground floor apartment where Rupert the squirrel lives in the attic rafters. Just when it seems that the holiday will come and go without so much as a Christmas tree, Rupert acts as the family's guardian angel, not only saving Christmas, but changing their lives forever. The film is enlivened with the warmth and sweetness of an unforgettable love story between Terry Moore (of Mighty Joe Young) and Tom Drake (of Meet Me in St. Louis). Rupert the Squirrel (created using George Pal's Academy Award winning animation technique) will charm young and old alike. Jimmy Durante shines when he sings Jingle Bells and other well-loved Christmas carols in the evocative voice that made him one of America's recording legends.
