                    This shows an old man coming along happy in his belief that he has a large, fine watermelon; but a crowd of street kids have made up their minds to get the melon, and the picture shows them waiting up an alley for the old man to pass, and when he does the boys rush out and push, with the result that the melon falls to the ground, and then what a sight! Nothing to be seen but the boys, melon and old man chastising them. Fine picture; great hit; absolutely.
