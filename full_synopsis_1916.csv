                    Intolerance and its terrible effects are examined in four historical eras. In ancient Babylon, a mountain girl is caught up in the religious rivalry that leads to the city's downfall. In Judea, the hypocritical Pharisees condemn Jesus Christ. In 1572 Paris, unaware of the impending St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, two young Huguenots prepare for marriage. Finally, in modern America, social reformers destroy the lives of a young woman and her beloved.

                    Four parallel stories of intolerance through the ages - most specifically ancient Babylon, the era of Christ's uprising, the French Renaissance during the reign of Charles IX and his mother Catherine de Medici, and present day - are presented. That intolerance is solely because of social groupings as opposed to the people as individuals. Each story tells of the group in power who use that power to quash a popular uprising - usually with violence - and the affect that it has on a young couple who just want to live largely in peace. The movie moves from story to story, cutting from one to another during moments similar to the two stories. But overriding the entire proceeding is the Eternal Mother, who is seen rocking the cradle of the human race.

                    Four tales from director D.W. Griffith show how intolerance and hatred have affected mankind through the ages. In the first tale a young girl, the Dear One and her father are forced to move to the city after he loses his job at a local mill. The dear One faces a hard life after her husband is falsely convicted.In the second tale, the Pharisees ignore Jesus Christ's message of love and protection and refuse to help him. In the third tale, a young Huguenot couple, Brown Eye and Prosper Latour, prepare for their wedding in 1572 Paris unaware of the plans to eliminate the Protestant sect. Finally, the last story looks at a young mountain girl of ancient Babylon in 539 B.C. who falls in love.

That night he is visited by the spirit of Joan of Arc and is transported back to the 15th Century. Joan's career begins when, as a peasant girl, she meets Trent's ancestor, also an English soldier, fighting for the Burgundians. After Trent is captured, Joan is brought to the attention of the beleaguered Dauphin, heir to the French throne, who cannot be crowned because the English hold the royal city of Orleans. The weak Dauphin is impressed by her vision and apparently heaven-sent powers which border on the supernatural and ultimately gives her command of the armies. She is victorious at Orleans and the new King is crowned. Joan resists Trent's entreaties of love and continues her struggle to free the rest of her country from English occupation. Sinister forces, both English and French, conspire against her and she is captured. Tortured and condemned, she dies at the stake but never loses her faith and vision.

She gives her heart to the witch, Hex, in return for which she becomes beautiful and wins the love of the king. While hunting, the king falls from his horse and is killed, leaving Mary Jane, who has been rechristened Brangomar, upon the throne. Brangomar forces Snow White to work in the kitchen and takes her lovely clothes away from her. When Snow White accidentally meets a young hunter she becomes interested in him and he is fascinated, though neither has any idea who the other is. So they are dumbfounded when he comes to Snow White's castle and presents a letter to the queen, asking for the hand of Snow White, for he is the Prince Florimund, who has been sent to ask for the hard of the little princess, whom he has never seen. Brangomar, who believed that the prince was coming to sue for her hand, is furious. She decides to kill the little girl and forces old Berthold, a hunter, and Snow White's devoted slave, to promise to kill the child. He is to bring her the heart of Snow White as proof of his act. Berthold takes Snow White into the woods and tells her what he has been forced to promise and she tells him to kill a pig and take its heart back to the queen. While he is doing this, a bird leads Snow White to the cabin of the seven little dwarfs, where she wins their undying gratitude. When the queen discovers that Snow White has escaped her, she tries to kill her with a magic comb and then inveigles her into biting a poisoned apple. Snow White falls prostrate and is discovered by the dwarfs, who carry her body in state to the palace, where the queen rejoices until the furious Prince Florimund threatens to kill her. In the excitement the dwarfs drop the casket, in which there lies the body of Snow White, and she awakens. The apple had stuck in her throat and she had not swallowed it. The witch turns Brangomar into a peacock and all ends happily.

This creature is human in every way, except that he cannot experience love. He does experience all other emotions, however, apparently including considerable frustration that he cannot experience love. The professor raises him as his son, not telling him who and what he is, until he reaches the age of 25, when he discovers the truth for himself. He now learns that women have a propensity for loving him, although he cannot return this feeling. This results in various tragic situations, wherein he drives young women to suicide. His frustration with the situation causes him to declare a war against humanity, vowing to spread fear and terror. He goes to a Middle Eastern society and is able to use ""superhuman abilities"" to cure the local Prince, but soon the locals decide that he must be in league with the devil and pursue him. There is a woman in love with him here, as well, but there is also a dog that gets killed by the crowd, which upsets him rather a lot for a man who doesn't feel love.

The girl loves frivolous things and Bancroft, a divinity student, finally estranges himself from her by his continual efforts to preach to her. Attracted by Hugh Wiley, a gambler, from a nearby city, Naomi finally elopes with him and eventually becomes known as the gambling queen. The girl's one ambition in life is to hoard up her wealth against the day when she shall lose her beauty and her popularity. Bancroft has plunged into religious work. He has become famous as an evangelist and has been trusted with the combination to the vault of the great tabernacle over which he presides. Learning this fact, Wiley inflames the mind of Naomi against Bancroft on the false ground that he has spurned her because of her life. He plans to have Naomi lure Bancroft to her gambling palace on a pretense, to overpower the minister while he is in there, steal the combination and loot the tabernacle. Furthermore, Wiley arranges to have the executive board of the tabernacle informed when the minister is in the gambling den, and to have the place raided by the police while he and his pal, McCarthy, rob the tabernacle. But the minister is too strong to succumb to the temptations of Naomi when he reaches her apartment, and his spiritual power wins the repentance of his temptress. Wiley, realizing that he is losing, springs upon Bancroft from behind and gets the combination away from him while his confederate alarms the police and the executive board according to the plan. But Naomi spirits the minister away through a secret passage, rushes to the tabernacle too late to prevent the robbery, and makes the great sacrifice of replacing the stolen money by her own ill-gotten hoard before the bewildered police and board officials arrive at the vault. In the final great moment of spiritual exaltation, Naomi has realized the greatness of Bancroft's love and of his power. Meanwhile Wiley, in an attempt to steal the loot from McCarthy, has wrecked the automobile in which they are fleeing and is killed.

Gloria is sixteen and vivacious, bubbling over with fun and good spirits, and naturally resents the rules and regulations under which her governess would have her follow. However, she takes advantage of every chance to escape the governess' eye, and romps about like a tom-boy. Family friends Judge Freeman and his daughter, Lois, also arrive in Palm Beach, where Lois is being courted by Dr. Stephen Royce, who also pays a lot of attention to Gloria. Brother David thinks Lois is swell. Richard Freneau, a young broker, becomes acquainted with both families, and is soon a rival of David's for the swell Lois. Glora takes a night drive along the beach in David's new racing automobile and manages to drive it into the ocean, where it doesn't float. She escapes but loses her way when she attempts to walk home alone, and the dawn finds her wandering around in the Everglades. She has borrowed a suit of boy's clothes, as her wet gown was not suitable for Everglade exploring, and is found by some Seminole Indians. Freneau, looking for her finds that Dr. Steve has found her first. However, while Dr. Steve is engaged in some hand-to-hand combat with one of the hostile Indians, Freneau, the Cad, escorts her safely home, and is unjustly hailed as her rescuer, since Gloria was unconscious when Dr. Steve came upon the scene. Back home in New York City, Freneau has made his case and is soon engaged to Gloria, while Dr. Steve remains a silent witness on the sidelines. Gloria has to determine which man is the best man for her, and she eventually does so - after nineteen more damsel-in-distress chapters.

                    Scrooge was a ""grouch,"" the greatest the world of literature has ever known. His former partner, Jacob Marley, had been dead more than seven years when the eventful Christmas Eve closed in on London. So imbued had Scrooge become with greed for money that his world, his sun, moon and stars were represented in bank notes and the securities he dealt in. He had not given Marley a thought since the day he buried him, and Scrooge celebrated that day by driving the best of business bargains. On this Christmas Eve Bob Cratchit, his faithful clerk, had been sent home with a gruff word instead of a ""Merry Christmas"" and had been told because he was to have the day off he must come to work extra early on the following morning. Scrooge's nephew had made his accustomed call to ask the old ""grouch"" to dine with him; and Scrooge had been his usual surly self in refusing. Kind-hearted collectors for charity had called, and Scrooge had turned them away with a snarl. There was no Christmas spirit, so far as Scrooge was concerned, and in his accustomed mood of ""grouchiness"" he ate his lonely meal and went to his lodgings, embittered, morose and decidedly ""anti-Christmas"" in spirits. In lodgings so cold that anybody but Scrooge would freeze, the old ""grouch"" prepared to spend the night. He was so miserly that he would not burn coal or use candles to dispel the gloom. Outside the cold was growing more intense; the merry voices of young and old picking up Christmas cheer and passing glad tidings in friendly salutations, grated on Scrooge's ears and made him hate more bitterly the world and everybody in it. Suddenly Scrooge is aroused by the clanking of chains and footfalls on the stairs, and before he realized what was transpiring the ghost of Jacob Marley was standing at Scrooge's elbow. The subsequent events transpired through the visits of three ghostly messengers: Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Future. These apparitions led Scrooge through his childhood, youth and manhood; recalled in vivid reality the varying phases of his career, and Christmas Future shows him what he may expect, under conditions that involve his change of heart and attitude toward mankind. When Scrooge awakens we see his change of heart, exemplified in wondrous ways; behold him as the kindly man, bubbling over with the Christmas spirit; see him transfigured, a lovable and kindly old man, solely bent upon making up in charitable and humane deeds for the wasted years of his ill-spent life.

                    Episode 1: Mary Page, actress, is playing the leading role in ""The King's Daughter,"" in rehearsal at the opening of the story. The show is secretly backed by David Pollock, man about town, who is in love with the girl. Mary is in love with Philip Langdon, a young lawyer. Pollock attends every rehearsal. He is really watching Mary. Philip Langdon, attorney-at-law, one day, keeps an appointment with Mary. He is talking to her on the stage when they are discovered by Pollock. Pollock is overcome with rage and orders the manager to show Langdon out. Langdon smilingly leaves the theater and waits outside. Mary goes to her dressing room. Pollock follows and attacks her. He is worsted in a fight by Langdon, who hears Mary's cries. On its premier, the play is declared a huge success and Mary attends a banquet given for the company. She is accompanied by Langdon, who waits in the hotel lobby. Pollock also goes to the hotel and engages a room, drinking heavily. He sends a bellboy to Mary with the message that Langdon wants to see her and she comes to the room. There she discovers herself trapped. Langdon, meanwhile, sees Mary leave the dining room and follows her. While he is trying to find out where she went, he hears a scream and a shot. He leads the crowd to Pollock's room, where he finds him dead. Mary is arrested. Episode 2: Mary Page is placed on trial for her life for the murder of David Pollock. She is defended by Philip Langdon. The first witness to go on the stand is the bellboy whom Pollock sent to summon Mary from the banquet table to his room. He tells the jury how Pollock had bribed him to tell Mary it was Mr. Langdon who wished to see her. The hotel detective is next to take the stand. He tells of the finding of Pollock's body with Mary in a dead faint beside it, and of the pistol which lay at her side. The theater carpenter's testimony is damaging to the State's evidence. Mary Page, the defendant, finally takes the stand. When asked why she took a pistol to the banquet, she explains that she intended to give it to Langdon. It was the pistol Langdon wrested from Pollock in their fight in her dressing room. After giving her testimony, Mary Page falls in a faint and court is adjourned. Episode 3: The leading man in Mary Page's theatrical company has just created a sensation in the courtroom, where Mary is on trial charged with the murder of Dave Pollock. ""Langdon was either in the room or at the door when Dave Pollock was murdered!"" is the accusation made by the witness. The courtroom is quickly quieted and the charge seemingly is forgotten. Ruth Pollock, sister of the murdered man, takes the stand. Her startling testimony carries the spectators back to the time when Philip, Mary and Dave Pollock were young people together in a country town. Mary, it seems, had been engaged to Pollock. Her father, a heavy drinker, had forged Pollock's name to a check and to save her father from prosecution, although she loved Philip, she promised to marry Dave. The announcement was made at a dance. Philip, not knowing of the forgery, believed Mary had jilted him and went into the bar and began drinking. Mary tried to get him out of the place and as she stood there, her arms around Philip, Pollock appeared. Mary announced that she could marry no one but Langdon and Pollock, enraged, produced the check bearing the signature forged by Dan Page, Mary's father. Langdon, for the first time, realized the power Pollock had over Mary, and seized the check and destroyed it. The check proved to be only a copy and Pollock browbeats Mary into promising again to wed him. ""But,"" Mary threatened Pollock, ""you will regret this to the end of your life."" Brandon, the reporter, who testified to the scene at the dance, swore that during the struggle he saw on Mary's shoulder finger prints that came and faded away in an uncanny manner. Brandon was another of the young people in Mary's home town who went to New York. He was in police headquarters the morning after the murder, discussing the mysterious affair when Mary Page, in evening gown, without hat or coat, was brought in by a policeman who had found her wandering in the street. As Brandon stood there and heard Mary murmuring incoherently again he saw on her shoulder those uncanny finger prints. As he approached Mary the door opened and Langdon entered. ""I give myself up,"" said Mary to the sergeant and turned and fell into Langdon's arms. Episode 4: Mary Page is charged with the murder of Dave Pollock. Langdon loves Mary and is her attorney in the trial. Langdon has a chance to save his sweetheart by confessing the murder, but he ignores the opportunity. Insanity is Mary Page's defense. ""If Mary Page murdered Dave Pollock,"" Langdon announces, ""she did it while suffering from 'repressed psychosis.'"" Then he brings witnesses who tell thrilling incidents of Mary's early life. Mary's father, Dan Page, was a drunkard. Because of a powerful pre-natal influence Mary always had a horror of liquor. At times of great mental stress, upon her left shoulder have appeared the shadowy imprints of heavy fingers, a strange phenomenon caused by the fact that before Mary was born Dan Page brutally attacked Mary's mother. Mary had loved Langdon almost as long as she could remember. Pollock, who lived in the same small town, wanted to wed Mary and Dan, because Pollock knew of shady transactions in Dan's career, favored Pollock's suit. In a drunken rage, in his home, Dan Page attacked Langdon with a hot poker. A glancing blow struck Mary on the forehead. She was rendered temporarily insane, and she fled into the wood. There Langdon found her and carried her home. Episode 5: While a way out seems to have shown itself to Philip Langdon, unforeseen circumstances serve to lessen the advantage he imagined he possessed. The young attorney defending Mary Page, accused of murder of Dave Pollock, calls a specialist in brain disorder, a Dr. Foster, who testifies concerning the unusual circumstances surrounding his first acquaintance with the case. He describes how Mary Page, insane, had lost herself in a wood for a night and how, when found by her lover, Langdon, had been brought to his attention. He found her to be suffering from repressed psychosis, a stage of mind originating in a prenatal influence which caused her to lose her reason at the sight of intoxication. His operation on her and later meeting in New York, shortly before Dave Pollock spirited her away, were retold for the jury. During the course of the testimony of the alienist, Langdon is obviously worried concerning a paper which the prosecutor's assistant presents to his chief. ""Serve it,"" Langdon hears him order. But before there is an opportunity for any development along this line a juror is stricken with heart trouble and court is adjourned. Mary Page goes back to her cell and Langdon, worried, wanders about and finds himself walking into the office of Daniels, the theater manager, head of the show in which Mary Page was appearing when Pollock, the ""angel"" of the production, interfered. A torn piece of paper catches his eye. He finds more and pieces together part of a note. It read: ''For any repetition of today's outrage you will answer to ME, even with your life. Daniels."" Langdon becomes a changed man as he reads. The note has changed his whole program of defense. Episode 6: Dr. Foster continues his testimony. He tells how Langdon, a detective and himself were led to an insane asylum by a crook. Here they found Mary Page under the care of quack doctors who had issued a written statement adjudging her insane. While here Pollock enters. All of them, including Pollock, go to the office of Dr. Foster, where Pollock offers Foster money to adjudge Mary insane. He is refused. Dr. Foster then testifies that his wife had seen Mary at work two weeks afterward and that was the last he had heard of her. Daniels, the theater manager, is then called to the witness stand. He tells of accompanying Mary to the banquet the night of the murder and how he left through the back entrance after discovering the murder. He says he was unaware that Mary had escaped. Langdon then produces the note he had found in Daniels' office, which threatened Pollock and was signed by Daniels. The jury is asked to leave the courtroom during the showing of this evidence. The judge rules that the letter is not admissible, unless proven that Pollock received the note. This is a blow to Langdon and a victory for the prosecuting attorney. Daniels then goes on to tell how he met Mary's father in a saloon the night of the murder, and how he nearly went insane when told of Mary being suspected, declaring that he had told her not to kill him. The jury is puzzled by the new evidence. Episode 7: Philip Langdon calls Amy Lerue, companion of Mary Page, as a witness, and she tells bow the two girls were even forced to steal off a dumbwaiter in order to eat, so frequently were they rejected in seeking employment. How Pollock luckily happened to find them at this time and saved them from an embarrassing situation for their theft is related. How he further places Mary in his debt by saving her from the advances of a crooked theatrical man also furnishes part of her testimony. Finally, according to the witness, the girls find places with a show. So well does Mary please the manager that he shortly advances her to speaking parts and then suddenly gives her a place as leading woman. Thankful to him for making her a star, Mary goes to dinner, taking with her Amy, her companion. Pollock is introduced to them by the theater manager, and while he had seen them shortly before, he accepts the presentation without indicating previous acquaintance. At this point in her testimony Langdon's aide hands him a note, which tells that the missing Dan Page, father of Mary, has been found. Langdon asks an adjournment, goes to the place with a detective and discovers his man. ""She's not guilty,"" shrieks Page. ""I killed Dave Pollock."" Langdon is dumbfounded. Episode 8: This episode opens with a continuation of the testimony of Amy Lerue, companion of Mary Page, who was interrupted in the last episode by the sudden discovering of the missing Dan Page, which caused an adjournment of the trial. The girl told how the show managed by Daniels strangely went on the road for one-night stands, although doing quite well in the city. How it finally became stranded and only the appearance of Pollock saved their trunks from the sheriff. This was their first intimation that Pollock was backing the show. Dan Page, found the preceding day by Philip Langdon, is offered as a witness by the latter. Page, the drunken father of Mary, relates the story of the crime in all its details, saying that he had gone to Pollock's office with the frenzied idea of killing him or doing anything else which would release him from the hold the capitalist maintained on him. Here, according to the testimony, he found Mary, and, taking a pistol away from her, he shot Pollock. Then, excited, he forgot his faint-daughter and passed out of the room by another door. The prosecuting attorney, skeptical, places five pistols before the eyes of the witness. Page picks out one with which he was supposed to have killed Pollock. It was not the right one. He is held as a perjurer. Episode 9: This episode deals with the testimony of Meredith, an actor known to Mary Page and her friend Amy, who obtain employment as an artist's model. He helps the girls find like employment, and they, while disliking it, are compelled to accept. Dave Pollock finds a painting of Mary and later seeks to force an entrance to her apartment, only to be frustrated and beaten by Meredith. The police surgeon who rushed to the scene at the death of Pollock is the next witness examined. He hurls a bombshell into the camp of the defense by declaring the retina of the dead man's eye held a picture of the last person he saw. A photograph is produced. In the man's eye is seen the image of Mary Page! Episode 10: The mayor of the small town is on the witness stand with the opening of this episode. He tells how at the time of the murder Pollock was a candidate for congress against Langdon, and that the former failed in his attempt to buy off the younger man, and therefore attempted to discredit him. In a debate Pollock is made to look ridiculous by Langdon and he resolves to straightway put a blot on the lawyer's reputation. A fraudulent photograph of Langdon and a woman whose questionable reputation is obvious is exhibited and it reaches Mary Page. She is astounded and having learned of other plots, attempts to warn her lover, and comes under the power of the woman who is helping to entrap him. Bound and imprisoned in a room, she removes the 'phone receiver with her teeth and communicates with Langdon. At this point in the testimony Philip receives word from his detective that he has discovered men who had a difference with Pollock in a card game of the night preceding. It is a new clew. Episode 11: This episode opens with Detective Sergeant Callahan on the witness stand and takes up his testimony of how Philip Langdon himself was for a long time suspected of killing Dave Pollock, a crime for which he was defending his sweetheart, Mary Page. The police officer detailed how he raided the gambling den of Big Jim and found Mary Page a prisoner. Arresting her together with the gamblers she was immune to questioning, as she was suffering from psychosis, although this was unknown to the police at the time. Langdon was seen in the vicinity and suspected and shadowed by Callahan. As it developed the young lawyer's visit to Pollock's office was in an attempt to discover some trace of the missing Mary. Finding her, Callahan overheard Langdon ask her to give herself up and that he would defend her to his utmost. It was then that Langdon was no longer suspected. Episode 12: The testimony of Bennett, friend of Pollock's, takes up this episode. He tells how, with Pollock, he dined with Mary Page and Amy Lerue, and how after dancing they made a slumming tour. Chinese opium joints followed visits to gambling dens and the city was thoroughly ""done."" Pollock, by this time strangely lively, invited the party to enter a shooting gallery in the heart of the district. They did, and all tried with both rifle and pistol. Mary was the last to shoot and surprised her companions by her skill with the revolver. Pollock, who had been drinking, lurched toward the girl he desired at this exhibition of another of her various capabilities. He made a remark, unheard by the rest, but sufficient to make Mary wheel suddenly and declare: ""Another word like that from you and I will discharge this gun in your face!"" That ended the party, and Bennett's only further knowledge of the case was overhearing Pollock instructing gunmen to ""get"" Philip Langdon, Mary's sweetheart. Episode 13: The calling of the gambler Jim Bates to the stand at the opening of court brings the information that he has been missing for two days. Langdon, defending Mary Page for the murder of Dave Pollock, is visibly worried. Mayer, the impresario, testifies how he starred Mary Page after taking her out of the chorus at Pollock's behest. Finding Pollock irritated her he warned him the show would be abandoned as he could not tolerate his actions. At the conclusion of his testimony Langdon asks for an adjournment. He hastened to locate Bates and finds him in a saloon. Bates, trapped, is aided by companions and Langdon is tossed into a room. Bates is warned to catch a fast freight west and Langdon, hearing the scheme, drops out of a window and follows. He pushes open a door and Bates crouched in a corner is ready to shoot. He hesitates, however, and Langdon gets the gun, but not before the train is moving too rapidly for flipping. Episode 14: The gambler, Bates, stubbornly refuses to talk to Langdon, who has him covered with a pistol in the box car. A shot warns the passing brakeman and the train is stopped. Langdon, pushing his prisoner ahead of him, walks to the nearest station. All night he had watched his man. Court opens in the morning and Langdon fails to appear. His assistant is refused an adjournment. Chester, with Bates, the chief aids of Big Jim Cunningham, is on the stand telling how Pollock and the gambling house owner split, the latter at the time intimating that something might happen to Pollock if there was any further conflict. As Chester was describing the events just preceding the death of Pollock he mentioned that following a shot he saw Bates running down an alley. Bates and Langdon enter at that moment and the former, infuriated, by the apparent accusation, cries out: ""He lies. He killed Pollock himself."" Court is adjourned to take up the new accusation which promises to solve the mystery for which Mary Page is held. Episode 14: The fate of the murderer of Pollock is strongly intimated in this installment of the Essanay serial. Langdon succeeds in bringing Bates into the courtroom just as Chester has finished his testimony, that he heard a shot and saw Bates running down the alley, the night Pollock was killed. Bates turns on Chester and accuses him of having killed Pollock. Episode 15: The concluding episode of the Essanay serial does not give the answer as to who killed Dave Pollock until just before the finish. In a story of this kind the main object is to sustain the interest by preventing the spectator from making the right guess. The way in which everyone has been made to suspect first one person then another during the progress of the trial stamps the author and the producer of the serial as adepts in the art of play construction. The efforts of the cast have never slackened from the opening reel, and the long trial has been conducted in an impressive and always interesting manner.

Priscilla had to fight for an education. At last, through the efforts of Anton Farwell, the schoolmaster, Priscilla had the opportunity of beginning her education. For a rest there came to the spot Mrs. Travers and her crippled boy, Dick, and later a specialist, Dr. Leydward, who was to eventually straighten the crooked limbs of the boy. Priscilla and Dick met and a romance between the two was begun. Jerry Jo, a half-breed, coveted the girl, and lured her to a house on the hill where there was a library. Although the girl was as sweet and pure when she returned home the next day her father sent her from his roof. Priscilla went to her only friend, Anton Farwell, and together they started for a new country. For Farwell was hiding from the world. In the long ago he had loved Joan Moss, and for the love of her killed the brother of Dr. Leydward. Before Priscilla and Farwell had gone far he received word that he must choose the alternative of living buried in the woods or in prison. So Priscilla went on to find her way alone in the big city with the mission to look for Joan. Priscilla devoted her life to the care of the sick, and so once more she and Dick Travers met, and worked hand in hand for suffering humanity. It was thus that she knew Dr. Leydward and his daughter, Margaret, who was to wed Clyde Hunter. One day as Priscilla was strolling in the park she saw Jerry Jo, now a nondescript beggar. Towards him she bore no malice, but a strong desire to make life happier. On following Jerry Jo to the tenement room he called home, some of the inmates mistook her for an angel of mercy for a dying woman, who was none other than Joan. From her lips she learned that the crippled child belonged to the affianced of Margaret Leydward, and also secured Farwell's exoneration. She showed Leydward and Margaret the true type of the man the latter was about to marry. Then she wandered back to the ""place beyond the wind"" to find comfort and peace. She found that her mother had died and her father had been stricken blind and still refused to own her as his own flesh and blood, and a second time sent her from his home. And then, crushed and wounded, she again found solace in her old friend, Anton Farwell, who a short time previous had returned to his home. To Farwell she told of the finding of Joan, but left with him his ideal of her, of her trueness and worth of trust. Priscilla returned once more to her little sanctuary in the woods, where she had erected her own altar to her own God, and where, too, she first met Dick. And there he found her. For realizing his love for her, he had followed her to the ""place beyond the wind"" and for a second time, with his old violin he started a new spark in the life of tho one woman, the one whom he would cherish and love and protect as long as time went on.

                    In the mid 19th century, lawyer Pudd'n head Wilson suffers the mockery of the community because of his obsession with fingerprints. Two of his samples are the infant prints of Tom Driscoll, the son of a white woman, and Chambers, whose mother is a mulatto nurse. Both boys have the same father, however, and both are about the same age, and after their birth, Roxy, angry at the Driscolls, switches them. Then, the false Tom murders his uncle and tries to blame his valet for the crime. Pudd'n head defends the accused, and while comparing new fingerprint samples against the old, discovers the switch that was made years before. He then convinces an initially doubting jury to accept the infallibility of fingerprint evidence, after which the real Tom is restored as the Driscoll heir and the false one goes to jail.

                    Roy Somerville has turned out a rather interesting story that will hold the interest of the majority of audiences as produced by the Triangle-Fine Arts Company. It is a five-reel feature and was produced under the direction of C.M. and S.S. Franklin, with Norma Talmadge as the star. Cora (Norma Talmadge) is wedded to Arthur Vincent (Eugene Pallette) and there are two children. Vincent is the son of the president of a bank and is devoting the greater part of his time to Jane Courtenay, a cabaret dancer, who is willing to have him devote his time to her as long as he is a good provider. The wife, who has been sadly neglected, turns to her sister, who is wedded to Fred Brown, a young detective. His brother Charles, who works in the elder Vincent's bank as a cashier, lives with them. He was Cora's first love and has never quite recovered from the fact that she jilted him to wed Vincent because of his money. The cabaret dancer makes several demands on the young Vincent, who tries to borrow money from his father to meet them; failing to receive the loan he agrees to aid several friends of the cabaret charmer to rob his father's bank. After the robbery Charles Brown is accused of the crime and arrested. But the robbers are discovered in their hiding place, and in escaping all but one is killed. Cora is left a widow and the natural supposition is that she and Charles were happily married afterward. Just where the title comes in is hard to say, but the picture while not one of the best that has been produced at the Fine Arts, is one that will get by because it will particularly appeal to women.
