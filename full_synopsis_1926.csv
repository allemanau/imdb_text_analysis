The engineer, Johnnie Gray (Buster Keaton) gets down to oil around, and is observed by two admiring boys. He has two loves: his engine and his girl. The two boys follow him when he goes to call on Annabelle (Marion Mack). They follow him right into her house, and he has to trick them to get them to leave. He presents Annabelle with a portrait of himself in front of his engine. Annabelle's brother (Frank Barnes) arrives with the news that war has broken out. He and their father (Charles Smith) go to enlist. Annabelle expects Johnnie to enlist, so he says goodbye. She gives him a kiss, and he backs off the edge of the porch.Johnnie runs by a shortcut and vaults a counter to be first in line. He doesn't hear that he is ""more valuable to the South as an engineer,"" so he doesn't understand why he is rejected. He tries two more times to sign up, but is kicked out the door. Annabelle's father and brother invite him into the line, but he has had enough. They think he is a disgrace, and tell Annabelle he never got in line. He sits dejected on his engine's siderod. Annabelle tells him she won't speak to him until he is in uniform. An engine hostler moves the engine, with Johnnie still sitting on the siderod. He doesn't notice until, on the third revolution, the locomotive is entering the enginehouse.One year later, in Chattanooga, Gen. Thatcher (Jim Farley) and his ""chief spy"" Capt. Anderson (Glen Cavender) hatch a plan to take a group of spies to steal a train at Big Shanty and drive it north, burning bridges to cut the supply line to the Confederate army threatening Chattanooga.At Marietta, Annabelle boards Johnnie's train to visit her wounded father. Johnnie sees her pointedly fuss with her brother's medals. When the train stops at Big Shanty for breakfast, Anderson and his men get off on the side away from the station. Annabelle gets into one of the boxcars to retrieve money from her trunk. The men remove the coupling pin between the boxcars and the coaches, get aboard, and start the engine. They discover Annabelle, and have to take her. Johnnie calls for others to follow him, as he runs after his train, but they soon give up running.The Yankee spies tie up Annabelle. They stop to cut the telegraph wires, and back at Big Shanty, the operator notices the line go dead. Johnnie stops at a handcar shed, and only then notices that no one has followed him. But he gets the handcar going. The spies remove a rail and jam stones in the guardrail. Johnnie falls off the handcar, which runs off the track and smashes down an embankment. The ""General"" speeds past Kingston, where the ""Texas"" waits on a siding. Johnnie sees a bicycle, which he leaps on, but it doesn't work well along the rough roadbed. On the ""General,"" Capt. Anderson unpacks a Confederate uniform. Johnnie runs into Kingston and shouts for help. Soldiers pile onto the flatcar behind the ""Texas."" Johnnie pulls the pin behind the flatcar to leave the rest of the train, but the flatcar is not coupled to the locomotive, and when he speeds away he does not notice the flatcar full of soldiers is left behind.By the time he notices he is alone, Johnnie sees a railroad mortar on a siding. The Yanks have stopped for water and wood. Johnnie is pulling the mortar car. The spies see him, and pull away without shutting off the water, and Johnnie gets an unexpected shower. Capt. Anderson won't stop and fight because he assumes they are outnumbered. They chop through the rear wall of the end boxcar. Back on the mortar car, Johnnie loads one handful (and a bit more) of powder, wadding, and a cannonball into the mortar, aimed to arc over the engine and hit the spies. He lights the fuse, and hurries back over the tender to the engine. The mortar fires, and sends the cannonball in a short arc right into the cab. Johnnie rolls it out of the cab and returns to the mortar. As he prepares another shot, there is a huge explosion beside the track back down the line. This time he puts the whole canister of powder in the gun. In hurrying back to the cab, his foot gets caught in the coupling bar, and dislodges it. When he finally gets his foot unstuck, the bar falls down and bangs against the crossties. The jostling makes the mortar lower until it points right at Johnnie, who has now got his foot caught in a loop of chain. He gets free, and scrambles all the way to the cowcatcher. The two trains enter an S-curve, and are at just the right places when the mortar fires that the shot misses the ""Texas"" and explodes just behind the spies.The Yanks release the rear boxcar to leave it in Johnnie's way. He pushes it onto a passing siding and proceeds. Busy feeding the fire, he doesn't notice that the boxcar continues to roll to the end of the siding and back onto the main track. He can't figure out how the boxcar got in front of him again. From the remaining boxcar the Yanks drop timbers across the rails. Johnnie, looking for a cloth to handle a leaky valve, doesn't see when the boxcar hits one of the timbers and is derailed out of the way. He can't figure out why the boxcar is now gone.Now he can see the timbers on the track. He slows the engine, and runs ahead to lift the first one. But he stumbles, and falls back onto the moving cowcatcher, holding the timber. With adroit timing, he uses it to hit the next one out of the way.The Yanks throw a switch to a spur track, and lift Annabelle over the tender to the engine cab. Johnnie, occupied with firewood again, sees just in time to stop before the end of the spur track. He backs out of the siding, and starts the engine forward, but the wheels slip. He gets down to throw dirt onto the rails. He doesn't notice when the wheels get a grip and the engine pulls away. He has to run to jump on the back of the tender.The Yanks have started a fire in the remaining boxcar, and they leave it in a covered bridge. Johnnie arrives in time to push it out. But there is so much smoke in the cab that he retreats to the tender deck, where he sits on the water hatch, not having noticed the lid is not on. He finally diverts the burning car onto a siding.Johnnie is so busy chopping wood on the tender he does not notice the Confederate army retreating. The Union army now passes, and Capt. Anderson removes his Confederate uniform. Johnnie finally notices the Union soldiers, and crouches down on the floor of the cab.The ""General"" passes under a trestle, and loops around to stop on the trestle above. When Johnnie passes below, the Yanks drop timbers down on him. Some land on the tender, providing fuel. But Capt. Anderson gets a good look, and says, ""There is only one man on that engine."" Johnnie stops, and gets off to hide in the woods. It starts to rain.When night falls, Johnnie climbs through the window of a house and takes food from the dining table. When a number of Union officers enter, he hides under it, and hears them planning to get supply trains across the Rock River bridge so the army can attack the Confederates the next day. One officer's cigar burns a hole in the tablecloth, and Johnnie is able to see when Annabelle is brought in and locked in the next room. The officers leave. Johnnie knocks out a sentry with a log and steals his uniform. He knocks out another sentry with his rifle butt, and climbs in the window of Annabelle's room. He gets her through the window, and leads her into the forest. They encounter a bear, and both get stuck in a bear trap. Johnnie keeps losing Annabelle, so he decides they should stay in one place until dawn.The next morning, Johnnie sees his locomotive. He empties a large sack of boots and stuffs Annabelle into the bag. Then he realizes one of his own shoes has come off and he has to find it among all those on the ground. He joins a line of soldiers loading the boxcar behind the ""General."" He stands where Annabelle can reach to uncouple it from the rest of the train, then puts her into the boxcar as a bag of supplies. He cringes and covers his eyes when he sees a crate and a barrel tossed in after her. He joins the line loading firewood, knocks out the officer in the cab, and starts the engine, heading back south.Johnnie stops outside of town, loops a rope over a telegraph pole, and ties it to the boxcar. When he pulls away, the pole and wire are pulled down, and the telegraph line is cut. He chops the rope, leaving the pole across the track. From the tender, he chops through the front wall of the boxcar, climbs in, and searches for Annabelle. He finds her among all the freight only when he steps on the sack she is in. Then he has to help her get across to the tender.Johnnie stops to throw fence rails onto the tender for firewood, but he has some difficulty getting them to stay there. Meanwhile, the Yanks have given chase with the Texas and another engine. They have to stop to get the telegraph pole out of the way. Annabelle takes what is left of the rope, and ties it across the track between two young pine trees. Johnnie almost leaves without her. When she shows Johnnie what she has done, he demonstrates how ridiculously flimsy it is. But the Yanks are coming, and they scramble into the engine cab and start off. The rope pinions the soldiers riding the ""Texas"" and the two trees are uprooted and get caught up in the siderods. Annabelle's arrangement has succeeded in forcing the pursuers to stop once more.Johnnie knocks out the whole back wall of the boxcar. The Yanks have to stop again to clear it off the track. He slows them down by tossing all the freight onto the track out the open back. In the cab, the Union officer is just regaining consciousness. Johnnie returns just in time, knocks him out with a well-aimed log, and takes his pistol.They stop at a water tank. Johnnie does not notice he has pulled the spout away from the supply pipe. When he opens the valve, Annabelle is knocked down by the deluge. He replaces the spout, and she gets more water over her. They leave, the water still flowing, and it drenches the officers on both the chasing trains.Annabelle feeds the fire. She sees a log with a big hole in it, and rejects it, tossing it out of the cab. Johnnie can't believe it. The Yanks plan to couple to the rear of the boxcar. Annabelle sweeps the cab; Johnnie tosses the broom. Annabelle feeds the fire with kindling; Johnnie picks up a sliver and hands it to her. She tosses it in the firebox. He shakes her, then kisses her.The Yanks catch up, and couple to the rear of the boxcar. At the forward end, Johnnie uncouples it. The Yanks fire at him. They switch the boxcar into a siding, then back out onto the main track. The second train smashes into them, knocking down officers. They just get re-seated when the train starts with a lurch, and they tumble again.Johnnie fastens a chain between the tender and some switch points. He has Annabelle start the engine, and the chain deforms the switch points. But Annabelle cant stop the engine. Johnnie runs downhill to meet her where the track passes below, but she gets the locomotive reversed, and he has to scramble back up the hill. They meet the Yanks at the broken switch, where the two Yank trains end up on an elevated spur track, smashing again, allowing Johnnie and Annabelle to get away.Johnnie sticks the end of a fence rail in the fire. He stops in the middle of the Rock River bridge, and piles firewood on the ties behind the tender. Meanwhile, the Yank officers can't figure out how to fix the switch so they can continue the pursuit, and a Union army is approaching the rendezvous at the bridge. Johnnie pours kerosene from the headlamp onto the firewood. Annabelle knocks the burning fence rail off the tender, and Johnnie is trapped on the far side of the fire in the middle of the bridge. He jumps over the fire just as Annabelle moves the engine forward, and Johnnie falls through a gap into the river.The Yank officers are still ineptly dealing with the broken switch. Johnnie hails a Confederate picket, and is fired at. Annabelle points out that he is still wearing the Yankee uniform, so he changes. They pull into Marietta, with the whistle blasting, and Johnnie runs to the Division Headquarters to warn them of the attack. The General leads the army out of town, and Johnnie and Annabelle find themselves in the middle of a stampede of traffic. Annabelle sees her wounded father, and Johnnie is left in the deserted street. He finds a sword belt and pistol, straps them on, and follows the army.The Yank officers are still trying to fix the switch. A locomotive engineer pushes his way through them and does a neat, quick fix using an ax. The two engines reach the Rock River bridge at the same time as the Union army arrives. The General says, ""That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river."" The ""Texas"" proceeds onto the bridge, the span collapses, and the engine crashes into the river.The Confederates surprise the Union army, and a fight begins. Johnnie is near an officer, and he imitates his commanding gestures, but his sword keeps coming apart. He stands near a gun battery, where a sharpshooter keeps picking off the artillerymen. Finally Johnnie's broken sword is effective. At his commanding swing, the blade comes off again and spears the sharpshooter. Johnnie tries firing the unmanned cannon. He has to yank the firing lanyard so hard that the gun tilts straight up before firing. He retreats, but the shot lands in the river, blowing a dam. The surge of water catches the Yankee infantry in the river, forcing them to retreat. Johnnie directs the other artillerymen to fire at officers on the remaining train. They retreat, and the whole army retreats. Johnnie directs another shot that derails the last car, stopping the retreating supply train. Johnnie saves a battle flag, and mounts a rock, inadvertently stepping on an officer who was observing from a cleft.The victorious army marches back into town, with Johnnie among those leading. He peels off and sits on the rear of his locomotive. When he goes into the cab, he finds the forgotten Yank officer just waking up. He escorts him to Division Headquarters and hands him over to the General. After a brief explanation, the General has Johnnie remove the uniform that does not belong to him, as Annabelle and her father watch. The General then gives him an officers coat and the Yankees surrendered sword. He poses for Annabelle and is enlisted as a Lieutenant.Johnnie takes Annabelle to the General, and they sit together on the siderod. His kiss is interrupted by the need to salute a passing soldier . . . then another . . . and another. Then a whole regiment approaches, so Johnnie repositions so he can kiss Annabelle while he pumps his hand up and down in salute after salute.","

Annabelle sees her wounded father, and Johnnie is left in the deserted street. He finds a sword belt and pistol, straps them on, and follows the army.The Yank officers are still trying to fix the switch. A locomotive engineer pushes his way through them and does a neat, quick fix using an ax. The two engines reach the Rock River bridge at the same time as the Union army arrives. The General says, ""That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river."" The ""Texas"" proceeds onto the bridge, the span collapses, and the engine crashes into the river.The Confederates surprise the Union army, and a fight begins. Johnnie is near an officer, and he imitates his commanding gestures, but his sword keeps coming apart. He stands near a gun battery, where a sharpshooter keeps picking off the artillerymen. Finally Johnnie's broken sword is effective. At his commanding swing, the blade comes off again and spears the sharpshooter. Johnnie tries firing the unmanned cannon. He has to yank the firing lanyard so hard that the gun tilts straight up before firing. He retreats, but the shot lands in the river, blowing a dam. The surge of water catches the Yankee infantry in the river, forcing them to retreat. Johnnie directs the other artillerymen to fire at officers on the remaining train. They retreat, and the whole army retreats. Johnnie directs another shot that derails the last car, stopping the retreating supply train. Johnnie saves a battle flag, and mounts a rock, inadvertently stepping on an officer who was observing from a cleft.The victorious army marches back into town, with Johnnie among those leading. He peels off and sits on the rear of his locomotive. When he goes into the cab, he finds the forgotten Yank officer just waking up. He escorts him to Division Headquarters and hands him over to the General. After a brief explanation, the General has Johnnie remove the uniform that does not belong to him, as Annabelle and her father watch. The General then gives him an officers coat and the Yankees surrendered sword. He poses for Annabelle and is enlisted as a Lieutenant.Johnnie takes Annabelle to the General, and they sit together on the siderod. His kiss is interrupted by the need to salute a passing soldier . . . then another . . . and another. Then a whole regiment approaches, so Johnnie repositions so he can kiss Annabelle while he pumps his hand up and down in salute after salute.

All that is about to change.Leo and Ulrich are on military furlough and have returned home together where they are greeted at the train station by Leo's mother [ Eugenie Besserer] and Hertha, who is now almost 16 years old. As they are about to gather up their bags and depart from the station, Leo sees a beautiful woman debark from the train and walk to a waiting carriage. When she drops her bouquet of flowers, Leo hurries over to pick it up.

The day before Leo is to return to the military base to serve out his last five months of duty, his world collapses. While languishing in his lover's arms, her husband comes home. The love of Leo's life is Countess Felicitas von Rhaden [Greta Garbo], and Count Rhaden [ Marc McDermott] is not amused.Rhaden challenges Leo to a duel, first warning him that no scandal can come to the Rhaden name, so they stage the duel under the pretext of a dispute during a card game. Ulrich attempts to talk Leo out of the duel, but Leo is adamant. He and Rhaden begin their pacing, two shots are fired, and Rhaden is killed. Following Rhaden's death, the military court ""advises"" Leo to sign up for a five-year stint in Africa, which means being separated from Felicitas.

                    Leo von Harden and Ulrich von Eltz have been best friends since childhood, when they even made a blood pact to stay so forever. They are currently bunk-mates - Leo on the top bunk and Ulrich on the lower - in the German military, where they have five months left to serve. Leo has grown up to be the more irresponsible of the two, but Ulrich will still do whatever he can to cover up for Leo. Their friendship will ultimately be tested when, while the two are on furlough, Leo meets a mysterious and beautiful young woman he later learns is named Felicitas von Rhaden. Their meeting sets off a chain of events which will ultimately lead to a death and a love triangle between the three, but one of which Ulrich is unaware. Only Leo and Felicitas know the entire truth, but it will be up to Leo in particular to decide what needs to be done to solve the problem they all face in light of Felicitas' unwillingness to do anything. Thrown into the mix is Ulrich's younger sister, Hertha, who has always loved Leo herself, and Pastor Voss, who has known Leo since he was a boy and who tries to be his voice of reason.

                    In Puritan Boston, seamstress Hester Prynne is punished for playing on the Sabbath day; but kindly minister Arthur Dimmesdale takes pity on her. The two fall in love, but their relationship cannot be: Hester is already married to Roger Prynne, a physician who has been missing seven years. Dimmesdale has to go away to England; when he returns, he finds Hester pregnant with their child, and the focus of the town's censure. In a humiliating public ceremony, she is forced to don the scarlet letter A - for adultery - and wear it the rest of her life. Dimmesdale is encouraged by the church fathers to demand of Hester the person with whom she sinned.

Elena [Greta Garbo] is in attendance at a masked ball when the Marquis de Fontenoy [Marc MacDermott] asks her a question. Elena replies that she doesn't love him and never will, and she then runs from him. Making her way through the crowd of boisterous revelers, Elena goes out to the garden where she encounters the Argentine engineer, Manuel Robledo [Antonio Moreno]. They remove their masks and fall immediately in love. They pledge themselves to each other, Robledo gives Elena a ruby ring, and she denies belonging to another man. Unfortunately, it's a lie. Elena is actually married to Robledo's old friend, the Marquis de Torre Bianca [Armand Kaliz], as Robledo finds out the next night when he drops by for a visit.Robledo, Elena, and the Marquis attend a large dinner party thrown by Fontenoy. As they begin a round of toasts, Fontenoy picks up his glass and toasts Elena, whom he calls ""the Temptress,"" ""who asks for nothing -- but takes all a man can give -- and more!"" As Robledo looks on in distaste, Fontenoy blames Elena for his financial ruin and pulls the jewels from her neck, claiming that he gave them to her. He then promptly keels over dead from the poison he has placed in his own drink. Even though he approved of Fontenoy's gifts, the Marquis is now POed at Elena for disgracing his name. When he complains about not being able to pay his ""debts of honor"" now that Fontenoy's cash flow is cut off, Elena empties her jewelry box in his lap.Totally disillusioned by Elena, Robledo returns to his home in the Argentine, where the entire village welcomes him back, including his four best friends -- Canterac[Lionel Barrymore], Pirovani [Robert Andersen], Timoteo [Francis McDonald], and Rojas [Hector Sarno] -- and the sweet and demure Senorita Celinda [ Virginia Browne Faire]. Robledo throws himself into the work of constructing a dam, made difficult because the sinister bandit, Manos Duras [ Roy D'Arcy], keeps stealing his horses and enticing his workers away. Still, the work progresses steadily until, one day, the Marquis de Torre Bianca shows up looking for work. Of course, he brings his wife, Elena, with him, since it was Elena who actually financed the trip with her jewels. Robledo is not pleased that she is there, but he offers to let them stay at his house.Elena, in her high heels, nylons, sultry eyes, French cloche, and fashionable European clothes, far outshines the local girls with their bare feet, peasant garb, and pigtails. In no time, Elena becomes the center of every man's attention, including Robledo's friends and the not-so-friendly Manos Duras, who comes with his band of caballeros to serenade Elena and to steal a kiss. When Robledo balks, Duras challenges him to a duel using Argentine whips. The confrontation is brutal, with Duras, a master of the whip, trying to put out Robledo's eyes. As Elena watches the two men, bare-chested, sweaty, and dripping in blood while fighting for her, she is certain that Robledo is still in love with her. In the end, Robledo bests Duras. As Elena lovingly dresses Robledo's wounds, he pushes her away and denies that he fought for her.Suddenly, a shot is heard from outside the window. Duras has made an attempt on Robledo's life, but his bullet hits the Marquis instead. Now that Elena is a widow, the men begin vying for her, buying her presents, throwing fiestas in her honor, neglecting their work, even forgetting their own wives and children. Concerned over her disruptive influence, Robledo purchases a ticket for Elena on the next boat back to Paris. Elena tries to convince him to go with her, but Robledo refuses.On the night before Elena is to sail for Europe, Canterac, forgetting the wife waiting for him in Paris, throws a fiesta for Elena, luring half of the work force to make merry with him. When Canterac takes a few moments alone with Elena to sip champagne and express his love for her, Pirovani surprises them by showing up just as Canterac steals a kiss. A fight breaks out, and Canterac ends up running his military sword through Pirovani. In horror, Elena runs off. Robledo advises Canterac to go away asap and goes off to find Elena. In a tirade, Robledo blames Elena for causing Fontenoy's ruin, for the death of her husband, and now for the death of Pirovani. Elena tries to explain that those things happened because of the men's desire for her body and for their own happiness, not for hers. Once again, she tries to convince Robledo that her love for himis genuine, but he scoffs.Suddenly, a loud explosion is heard. Manos Duras has seized the opportunity to blow up the dam. In the villagers' haste to build a barricade and keep the dam from flooding, Elena is forgotten for the moment. She returns to her room, where she finds a note attached to her door with a dagger. It is from Duras.

                    If there was one thing that Don Juan de Marana learned from his father Don Jose, it was that women gave you three things - life, disillusionment and death. In his father's case it was his wife, Donna Isobel, and Donna Elvira who supplied the latter. Don Juan settled in Rome after attending the University of Pisa. Rome was run by the tyrannical Borgia family consisting of Caesar, Lucrezia and the Count Donati. Juan has his way with and was pursued by many women, but it is the one that he could not have that haunts him. It will be for her that he suffers the wrath of Borgia for ignoring Lucrezia and then killing Count Donati in a duel. For Adriana, they will both be condemned to death in the prison on the river Tigre.

Especially as a mission was not the purpose of the money, Harold has every intention of shutting it down. Harold changes his mind when he meets and falls for Brother Paul's pretty daughter, Hope, who helps her father in his work. As such, Harold tries to help Brother Paul and Hope get who they want in the mission - petty thieves - to attend, which is no easy job, let alone getting them to stay. On the other side, Harold's wealthy friends are just as skeptical about Harold's foray into social service philanthropy.

Realizing the tragedy he has brought upon Amy's family, Aubrey visits the directors of a steel company and by bluffing sells them Joe's invention. The coup creates a furor in the Fisher household, happy at last that the ""show off"" has redeemed himself.

                    In the beginning, Manon Lescaut, a young mistress, is taken away from a convent by the French nobleman des Grieux, who is young as well, under the pretext he's her step brother. The two are in love and the debts are getting bigger each day due to him being disinherited by his father because of the wrong woman he fled with. She gets forced by the desire full and rich Marquis de Bli to stay with him in order to save her disinherited lover. At the acknowledgment of this, he doesn't want her for a while, until he cannot stand it anymore and takes her back. After this, expenses continue to grow due to Manons' posh habits, so the marquis continues to chase her, until the two lovers decide to get married in order to start a fresh new life. At the hearing of such news, the marquis kidnaps the girl and tries to convince her that she should live in wealth and accept his lavish offers, instead of the low class work she does. When Manon and des Grieux get the chance to see each other, she is refused again and wrongfully accused of acting after she expresses her joy to see him after work. At her return back to the marquis, he gets her deported to a convent, only to be followed eventually by des Grieux after he realizes that he loves her to much. Eventually, because of all the hardship and suffering, she dies in his arms.

                    The tale of two sisters with the older one pledged to look after the younger one that transpires between a department store, NYC's Central Park and a boarding house. THe older one is the sweet, old-fashioned type and the younger is a jazz-age flapper who takes whatever falls her way. Mame, the older, goes on vacation and returns home to find that her kid sister, Janie, has vamped her way into the arms of Mame's intended.

                    Mame Walsh promised their mother on her deathbed to look after little sister Janie; which is a strain, given that Janie helps herself cheerfully to everything from her sister's clothes to the boyfriend who's just proposed to her, and the money entrusted to her by fellow-employees at the store. You can't blame Mame for being just a little hurt and jealous when she comes back from holiday to find out what's been going on -- but she can't break that promise, so when it comes to getting Janie out of trouble, big sister comes to the rescue.

                    Carmen has neither a past nor a future. She lives only in the present. For her love is of no importance, just a passing whim.
