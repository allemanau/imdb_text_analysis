They commit the crime as an intellectual exercise; they want to prove their superiority by committing the ""perfect murder"". Phillip is the one who strangles David with a piece of rope while Brandon restrains David until he dies.After hiding the body in a large antique wooden chest, Brandon and Phillip prepare to host a dinner party at the apartment, which has a panoramic view of Manhattan's skyline. Brandon decides to use the chest containing the body as a buffet table for the food, just before their housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson (Edith Evanson) arrives to help with the party. ""Now the fun begins,"" Brandon says when the first guests arrive.The guests, who are unaware of what has happened, include the victim's fiancée, Janet Walker (Joan Chandler) and her former lover Kenneth Lawrence (Douglas Dick), who was once David's close friend. Also arriving is the victim's father Mr. Kentley (Cedric Hardwicke) and chatty aunt Mrs. Atwater (Constance Collier); his mother is not able to attend due to a cold.Brandon and Phillip's idea for the murder was inspired years earlier by conversations with their prep school housemaster, publisher Rupert Cadell (James Stewart). While at school, Rupert had discussed with them, in an apparently approving way, the intellectual concepts of Nietzsche's Übermensch, and De Quincey's art of murder, as a means of showing one's superiority over others. He too is among the guests at the party and the last one to arrive, since Brandon in particular feels that he would approve of their ""work of art"".Brandon's subtle hints about David's absence indirectly lead to a discussion on the ""art of murder"". The self-assured Brandon appears calm and in control, although when he first speaks to Rupert he is nervously excited and stammering. Phillip, on the other hand, is visibly upset and morose; aware that Rupert is the only person who might suspect what they just did. Phillip does not conceal it well and starts to drink too much. When David's aunt, Mrs. Atwater, who fancies herself as a fortune-teller, tells him that his hands will bring him ""great fame"", she is referring to his skill at the piano, but he appears to think this refers to the notoriety of being a strangler.Much of the long conversation, however, focuses on David and his strange absence, which worries the guests. A little later during the desert serving, a suspicious Rupert quizzes a fidgety Phillip about this and about some of the inconsistencies that have been raised in conversation. For example, Phillip had vehemently denied ever strangling a chicken at the Shaws' farm when Brandon brought up the story earlier, but Rupert has personally seen Phillip strangle several. Phillip later complains to Brandon about having had a ""rotten evening"", not because of David's murder, but over Rupert's questioning.As the evening goes on, David's father and fiancée begin to worry that he has neither arrived nor phoned. Brandon increases the tension by playing matchmaker between Janet and Kenneth. Mrs. Kentley calls, overwrought because she has not heard from David, and Mr. Kentley decides to leave, as does Janet and Kenneth. Mr. Kentley takes with him some books Brandon has given him, tied together with the same rope Brandon and Phillip used to strangle his son.When Rupert goes to leave, Mrs. Wilson accidentally hands him David's monogrammed hat, further arousing his suspicion. After Mrs. Wilson leaves, Brandon and Phillip are relieved that the dinner party is over and they can now move the dead body to their car in the car park garage and transport it to throw it in a lake upstate.However, Rupert returns to the apartment a short while after everyone else has departed, pretending that he has left his cigarette case behind. He hides the case behind some books on the chest, asks for a drink and then stays to theorize about David's disappearance. He is encouraged by Brandon, who hopes Rupert will understand and even applaud them. A drunk Phillip is unable to take it any more; he throws a glass and says, ""Cat and mouse, cat and mouse. But which is the cat and which is the mouse?""Then Rupert produces the rope used and questions them about it, when Phillip takes a gun that Brandon had on him and threatens to kill Rupert when he and Phillip struggle which leads to Rupert disarming Phillip, but getting his right wrist gazed by a bullet when the pistol fires.Now, Rupert lifts the lid of the chest and finds the body inside. He is horrified but also deeply ashamed, realizing that Brandon and Phillip used his own rhetoric to rationalize murder. Rupert now disavows all his previous talk of superiority and inferiority, realizing that there is no way to objectively define these concepts, then seizes Brandon's gun and fires several shots out the window in order to attract attention.

                    Brandon and Philip are two young men who share a New York apartment. They consider themselves intellectually superior to their friend David Kentley and as a consequence decide to murder him. Together they strangle David with a rope and placing the body in an old chest, they proceed to hold a small party. The guests include David's father, his fiancée Janet and their old schoolteacher Rupert from whom they mistakenly took their ideas. As Brandon becomes increasingly more daring, Rupert begins to suspect.

                    Upscale New York college students, friends and roommates Brandon Shaw and Phillip Morgan have just strangled their long time friend David Kentley to death in their apartment. They did it solely to show their superiority as humans both by being able to carry out such a crime without being caught, and by disregarding the life of who they consider an inferior being. While Brandon feels exhilarated by their act, Phillip is nervous, even more so by Brandon's plan: to hide David's dead body in an unlocked trunk in their living room, the trunk which will be front and center at a dinner party they will hold that evening, before they dispose of the body after the party. The guest list is also Brandon's way of showing his superior intellect, as he doesn't expect to be caught despite it including: David himself, who obviously will not show up; Kenneth Lawrence, David's best friend; Janet Walker, David's current girlfriend, and Ken's ex; Henry Kentley, David's father; and Mrs. Atwater, a visiting friend of Mr. Kentley's. Although Phillip is nervous enough by the presence of any of these guests as well their loyal housekeeper Mrs. Wilson, he is most nervous by their last guest, Rupert Cadell, their former prep school house master, who they consider their intellectual equal, and who had in the past stated openly that murder can be justified in certain circumstances. At the party, Brandon prides himself in the open innuendo of the discussion which makes sense if one knows about David's murder. The question becomes whether this innuendo or any other issue will unmask Brandon and Phillip's act and thus make it less than the perfect murder they assume it is.

                    Manhattan socialites Brandon Shaw and Phillip Morgan choke the life out of an associate, David, as an intellectual challenge to commit the perfect murder. Not content to escape the penalty of law by simply disposing of the body quietly, they furthermore devise an elaborate and dangerous display of arrogance: The two stuff David's lifeless body into a chest and throw a dinner party serving their guests, literally, from the convenient tabletop of the young man's grave. In attendance are Mr. Henry Kentley and Mrs. Anita Atwater, the victim's father and aunt; Kenneth Turner, the victim's rival for the hand of Janet Walker, David's fiancée, who also attends; Mrs. Wilson, the servant; and Rupert Cadell, the murderers' former teacher whose flippant repartee regarding social caste festered into the pathological short circuit that led to Brandon's and Phillip's crime. Brandon's sense of intellectual superiority swells to reckless levels throughout the evening as he makes a nail-biting game out of cleverly dropping his guests hints at nasty goings on. Meanwhile, Phillip grows increasingly frightful and guilt-ridden as Rupert inches ever closer to discovering why David hasn't yet arrived at the party.

They put their victim, David Kentley, in a chest in the living room where they are having a party later that evening. The guests include David's father and also one of their former teachers, Rupert Cadell. As the evening wears on Brandon, clearly the bolder of the two perpetrators, continually pushes his chances becoming ever bolder. Philip, on the other hand, begins to regret what they have done and combined with too much alcohol, begins to act oddly. All this leading Cadell to start wondering exactly what they have done.

With no money and a wife and two children to support, he is desperate for work. He is delighted to at last get a good job hanging up posters, but on the sole condition that he has a bicycle which must be used for work. He is told unequivocally: ""No bicycle, no job."" His wife Maria pawns their bedsheets in order to get money to redeem his bicycle from the pawnbroker.Early on in the film, Ricci's coveted bicycle is stolen by a bold young thief who snatches it when he is hanging up a poster.Antonio thinks that the police will take the theft very seriously, but they are not really interested in the petty theft of a bike. The only option is for Antonio and his friends to walk the streets of Rome themselves, looking for the bicycle. After trying for hours with no luck, they finally give up and leave.Desperate for leads and with his better judgement clouded, Antonio even visits the dubious backstreet fortune teller that he had earlier mocked, in the hope that she may be able to shed light upon the bike's whereabouts. However, she merely doles out to him one of the truisms that form her stock in trade: ""you'll find the bike quickly, or not at all."" Feeling cheated, a crestfallen Antonio hands over to her some of the last money that they have. After a rare treat of a meal in a restaurant, Antonio admits to his son that if he isn't able to work, they will simply starve.Antonio finally manages to locate the thief (who, it seems, had already sold the bicycle) and Bruno slips off to summon the police to the apartment. Antonio meanwhile, angrily accuses the thief of stealing his bike but the boy denies all knowledge of the crime. When the policeman arrives, he sees the accused boy lying on the floor feigning a seizure and surrounded by irate neighbours who blame Antonio's accusations for causing the ""innocent"" boy's fit.The policeman tells Antonio that although he may have seen the boy stealing the bike, he did not catch the thief red-handed, nor has he any witnesses and that Antonio making an accusation is not good enough. With no proof and with the thief's neighbours willing to give him a false alibi, he abandons his cause. Antonio walks away from the house in despair, as the thief's neighbours follow, jeering at him about his lost bicycle.At the end of the film in one of the most resonant scenes, Antonio is sitting on the curb outside the packed football stadium. He looks at the hundreds and hundreds of bicycles that are parked outside the stadium and as he cradles his head in despair, a fleet of bicycles mockingly speeds past him.After vacillating for some time about whether to steal one for himself, he decides he has no other option but to snatch one that he spots outside an apartment. Unluckily, he is seen taking the bike and caught by a crowd of angry men who slap and humiliate him in front of his son. Ironically, this time with an army of witnesses who catch him, he is frogmarched off to the police station but after seeing how upset Bruno is, the owner of the bicycle declines to press charges.The film ends with the man and his son, sad and let down from what has just happened, they walk along in a crowd, leaving us with a dim outlook for the two. Holding hands, they are both reduced to tears.","

There is only one condition: he must have a bike of his own. At the moment his bicycle is at the pawn-shop, but Antonio's wife Maria says they can pawn their six sheets instead. The first day at work Antonio's bicycle is stolen. A friend offers to help him search for it the next morning at Piazza Vittorio, where the street vendors sell stolen bikes. The search is unsuccessful, but Antonio and his little son Bruno don't give up. They continue to the market at Porta Portese, where Antonio happens to see the thief talking to an elderly man.

    Synopsis
    The film tells the story of Antonio Ricci, an unemployed man in the depressed post-World War II economy of Italy. With no money and a wife and two children to support, he is desperate for work. He is delighted to at last get a good job hanging up posters, but on the sole condition that he has a bicycle which must be used for work. He is told unequivocally: ""No bicycle, no job."" His wife Maria pawns their bedsheets in order to get money to redeem his bicycle from the pawnbroker.Early on in the film, Ricci's coveted bicycle is stolen by a bold young thief who snatches it when he is hanging up a poster.Antonio thinks that the police will take the theft very seriously, but they are not really interested in the petty theft of a bike. The only option is for Antonio and his friends to walk the streets of Rome themselves, looking for the bicycle. After trying for hours with no luck, they finally give up and leave.Desperate for leads and with his better judgement clouded, Antonio even visits the dubious backstreet fortune teller that he had earlier mocked, in the hope that she may be able to shed light upon the bike's whereabouts. However, she merely doles out to him one of the truisms that form her stock in trade: ""you'll find the bike quickly, or not at all."" Feeling cheated, a crestfallen Antonio hands over to her some of the last money that they have. After a rare treat of a meal in a restaurant, Antonio admits to his son that if he isn't able to work, they will simply starve.Antonio finally manages to locate the thief (who, it seems, had already sold the bicycle) and Bruno slips off to summon the police to the apartment. Antonio meanwhile, angrily accuses the thief of stealing his bike but the boy denies all knowledge of the crime. When the policeman arrives, he sees the accused boy lying on the floor feigning a seizure and surrounded by irate neighbours who blame Antonio's accusations for causing the ""innocent"" boy's fit.The policeman tells Antonio that although he may have seen the boy stealing the bike, he did not catch the thief red-handed, nor has he any witnesses and that Antonio making an accusation is not good enough. With no proof and with the thief's neighbours willing to give him a false alibi, he abandons his cause. Antonio walks away from the house in despair, as the thief's neighbours follow, jeering at him about his lost bicycle.At the end of the film in one of the most resonant scenes, Antonio is sitting on the curb outside the packed football stadium. He looks at the hundreds and hundreds of bicycles that are parked outside the stadium and as he cradles his head in despair, a fleet of bicycles mockingly speeds past him.After vacillating for some time about whether to steal one for himself, he decides he has no other option but to snatch one that he spots outside an apartment. Unluckily, he is seen taking the bike and caught by a crowd of angry men who slap and humiliate him in front of his son. Ironically, this time with an army of witnesses who catch him, he is frogmarched off to the police station but after seeing how upset Bruno is, the owner of the bicycle declines to press charges.The film ends with the man and his son, sad and let down from what has just happened, they walk along in a crowd, leaving us with a dim outlook for the two. Holding hands, they are both reduced to tears.

After three weeks, they approach north Texas, where the land looks good to Tom. He decides he wants to break away from the wagon train and go find a place to start a ranch of his own. The wagon master tries to order him to stay, then tries talking him out of it, all to no avail. Tom is also pretty handy with his fists and a gun, so there wouldnt be any forcing him. Along with Tom and Nadine on the trip to California is Fen (Colleen Gray), Toms love interest. He and Fen are basically engaged (in love, anyway) and she wants to come with Tom and Nadine to find a ranch. Tom wont hear of it, promising to send for her once hes settled in. She doesn't like the idea of having to wait, but promises to come. Before leaving, Tom gives Fen a bracelet that belonged to his mother.Tom and Nadine take off with their wagon, horse, one bull and two cows, and get maybe 10-15 miles from the wagon train, near the Red River, when they look back and see black smoke. Realizing that the wagon train has most likely been attacked by Indians, they know they cant get back in time to help, and that some of the Indians are likely to come looking for them soon enough anyway, so they set up in a defensive posture and wait.Sure enough, maybe 6-7 Indian braves show up and begin an attack with a fire arrow that hits Tom's and Nadine's wagon (but doesnt do much damage). Both Tom and Nadine are good shots and they kill most of the attackers right away. However, one of their cows was killed by the Indians and then Tom has to fight hand-to-hand. He kills one Indian as they fight and fall into the river. Tom notices the Indian he killed was wearing the bracelet hed given to Fey. Tom then sneaks out to kill the last one or two Indians of the group, who were still out there hiding. The next day, theres a young boy named Matt Garth (Mickey Kuhn) who comes strolling along leading a cow and talking to himself, like hes lost his mind. Tom slaps the kid to snap him out of his trance. The kid then pulls a hand gun and points it at Tom. Tom grabs the gun and takes it away, knocking the kid down. The kid is not crazy, but just play-acting. Tom tells him never to pull a gun on him again. The kid has spunk and tells Tom never to take his gun from him again. Tom turns to Nadine and says, hell do. Tom hands Matt's gun back to him and allows him to come with them. Apparently, the family or group Matt had been with was attacked by Indians too, so he had no one left.The three of them travel deep into Texas, stopping at the Rio Grande, where Tom pronounces himself the new owner of all the land visible north of the river. He also says that 10 years hence, hell have the biggest and best ranch in all of Texas, with plenty of beef to feed and nourish all the people around the area. He tells Garth and Groot that he will brand all the cattle in his future herd with a D double bar (the bars representing the banks of the Red River). Matt wants an M added to the brand, but Dunson says he'll have to earn it.Two Mexican men come riding up and introduce themselves as employees of Don Diego, the man who owns the land they are standing on. At that moment, Don Diego was at his ranch headquarters 400 miles south, in Mexico. Tom tells the two men to ride back and tell Don Diego that all the land north of the Rio Grande now belongs to him and hes taking it. One of the men says that just cant be and he goes for his gun. Tom outdraws him and shoots him dead. He tells the other man to take his friends horse and go back and tell Don Diego what happened. Tom told the guy that he would take care of burying the other man's body.Flash forward nearly 15 years later to find Tom, Nadine and a grown Matt (Montgomery Clift) having a discussion about Matts recent return to the ranch, and the major problem of there being no market in Texas for all of Toms thousands of cattle (thanks to the Civil War basically bankrupting everyone). The decision is that they will need to drive the cattle north instead, to Missouri, to sell them. Tom was going to make Nadine stay behind, as Nadine was getting too old to ride, but the trail cook had just quit, so Nadine got to go, as the cowboys would need a cook.Tom and Nadine had a funny exchange, right after Tom had told Nadine he had to stay behind. Nadine was talking to himself, complaining about the decision, while Tom was trying to talk to Matt. Tom finally turned to Nadine and asked him what he was saying and why didnt he have his new teeth in his mouth, because he couldnt understand his mumbling. Nadine responded that everyone else could understand him just fine and he was keeping his teeth in his pocket until he needed them for eating.Matt was overseeing the branding of the cattle, preparatory to the drive, and having the men turn loose any cows belonging to a rancher named Meeker (Davison Clark), or to Don Diego. Tom rides up and orders that no cattle be turned loose and that they all be branded with the D-Double Bar brand (his). Matt doesnt agree, but tells the men to go ahead and do as Tom says. About that time, Mr. Meeker rides up with some of his men, including a hired gun, and asks Tom for permission to look through the herd to cull out any of his cows. Tom denies permission, telling Meeker that hes branding all of the cows he has, regardless of any other brands they may already have on them. Things get pretty testy and Matt and Mr. Meekers gunfighter, Cherry Valance (John Ireland) exchange words. Matt has become very handy with a gun himself. Tom relents somewhat, in that he decides to offer Meeker $2/head for any of his cows that make it to Missouri and get sold. Meeker agrees. Cherry then decides hed like to work for Tom instead of Meeker and asks to be hired on. Tom hires him at $10/month, the going rate for a trail hand.Matt and Cherry are just itching to have a fight (preferably a gunfight), and Tom realizes its probably inevitable, but he forces them to get along for the time being. They do have an initial challenge contest, where they borrow each others guns and alternately shoot at a tin can, impressing each other with their respective skills.In the bunkhouse, theres a poker game the night before the drive starts. Quo (Chief Yowlachie) is sitting opposite Groot. Groot has a good hand, but when Quo bets one silver dollar, Groot is aghast. Thats equivalent to 3 days pay. He asks Matt to loan him a dollar, but Matt refuses. The rule of the game is that only whats on the table at the time can be used to bet with. So, Quo asks Groot whats in the small bag he has there on the table and Groot tells him it contains his false teeth. Quo says hell accept half interest in the teeth to cover the one dollar bet. Groot isn't happy about it, but he agrees. They show their cards. Quo has the better hand and demands the teeth. Groot wants to know how hes supposed to eat without his teeth and Quo tells him that come grub time, you get em.Dunson comes into the bunkhouse and tells everyone that its now or never as far as their decisions to go on the drive. He tells them that there will be no hard feelings for anyone who wants to stay behind, and promised them that theyd still have jobs on the ranch after the drive is over. He tells them that theyll be doing good to make 10 miles a day on the 1,000 mile drive, 15 miles if they are lucky. Theyll face bad weather, dust, Indians and border gangs (once they get close to Missouri). But, once a cowboy says hell go, hes expected to finish the drive, whatever happens. Dunson makes everyone going sign a piece of paper representing their word to stick it out.The next morning, breakfast was served at 4:30 and, with nearly 10,000 head of cattle grouped together, at 5 a.m., Dunson quietly told Matt to take 'em to Missouri. All the cowboys whooped and hollered as they started out. Quo holds Groot to the results of their bet, only loaning the false teeth back to Groot at mealtimes. Groot is not happy about that. He tells Quo that the teeth help him keep the dust out of his mouth. Quo tells him to keep his mouth shut then, and dust not get in. Groot complains that before the drive is over, hell probably eat enough land to get himself incorporated in the Union as the State of Groot. Quo still says no. Dunson isnt happy about the situation either, complaining that Groot mumbles and needs to have his teeth in to be understood. The men start talking about taking the cattle to Kansas instead of Missouri, as its closer and there are less hazards along the way. However, because no one has personal knowledge of a railway actually being in Abilene, KS (where rumor has it there was one), Dunson says to forget it.Dunson goes through 3-4 horses a day, so hes obviously very involved in the drive.The group is 30 days into the drive with no major issues. One cowboy remarks that he doesnt like that. It makes him nervous. He prefers a balance of things going well and having trouble, not just one or the other. The trouble part does come, and it starts as a result of Bunk Kenneally (Ivan Parry) continuing to get into the supply of sugar (he dips his fingers into the sack whenever he can, which gets him in trouble with Groot). Everyone has been on their best behavior as far as being quiet, because the cattle are on edge. They are tired and there are coyotes milling about. Everyone is worried that the cows will stampede if something spooks them. So, when Bunk clumsily knocks over some of the cook pots as hes getting into the sugar, thats enough noise to start a stampede.One of the cowboys prefers to wear a bowler hat. He gets trapped behind a shrub in the middle of the stampede, so Matt and another fellow ride up and each grab an arm of this fellow and they carry him off to the side of the stampeding cows and let him down.After the cows are stopped and calmed down, it's noticed that one of the wranglers, Dan Latimer (Harry Carey Jr.) is missing. Latimer wore checkered pants and would talk about using the $100 he would be earning on the drive to buy a place to farm/ranch, and a pair of red shoes for his wife. A search begins and they find what's left of Latimer's distinctive checkered pants among a bunch of dead cattle. Dunson tells Matt to make sure the widow gets Dans money and whatever else. Matt replies, like a pair of red shoes?Dunson reads over Latimer's remains the next morning and as he puts the Bible back on the wagon, he goes over and picks up Groots' whip, at the same time calling out to Bunk: Bunk Kennally, you started all this! 400 cows dead and Latimer too. Stealing sugar like a little kid. Well, we whip kids to punish them for things like that. Dunson tells Teeler to strap Bunk to a wagon wheel. Before Teeler can do that, Bunk speaks up and acknowledges that he is remorseful about Latimer and the dead cows, but he tells Dunson he wont stand to be whipped. As he goes for his gun, hed likely have been shot dead by Dunson, but Matt draws first and shoots Bunk in the shoulder, saving his life. Dunson turns to Matt and says, you shot him, you take care of him!Matt provides Bunk with two horses and sends him back home. Cherry observes all this and tells Matt that while hes real fast with a gun, hes got a soft heart, and that will get him hurt some day. Matt says that could be, but not to count on it.40 days out, with reduced rations (after one wagon was destroyed in the stampede), the men become increasingly restless. Tom reminds them that they all signed on to see it through, like it or not. A cowboy named Sutter (William Self) rides up, his head bandaged and barely able to talk (there was a rope burn around his neck), saying he had been riding with the Garwood herd (2,000 cows) when they were ambushed by about 100 bandits. Hearing that, Naylor, Fernandez and another hand tell Dunson theyve had enough (but not until right after theyd watched Dunson set his gun belt down as he was preparing to go get some water). Dunson tells them they cant go. They reach for their guns as Groot tosses a loaded and cocked rifle to Dunson. Dunson's shots, in combination with those fired by Matt and Cherry, kill the three wranglers.Dunson orders the three buried, announcing that hell read over them in the morning. That prompts one of the cowboys to say: Plantin and readin, plantin and readin. Why, when youve killed a man, why try to read the Lord in as a partner in the job?Matt argues with Dunson over the need to confront and kill the three men. He and Groot both tell Dunson hes wrong to do such things. Groot then patches up a bullet wound on Dunsons lower left leg.That night, Teeler, Kelsey and Laredo are on watch, when they decide to take some ammunition and flour and ride out, headed back home. The next morning, Dunson sends Cherry and Buster to go get the three and bring them back, dead or alive.The herd arrives at the Red River. Matt wants to give everyone a rest and cross the river first thing in the morning. Dunson will have none of that, and orders the crossing to begin immediately. He finds a couple areas of quicksand in the river to be avoided then orders the crossing to start. The process continues into the night. Between 30-40 head are lost during the process. Dunson is limping badly and pulls heavily from a bottle of whiskey once he sits down to rest. Hes exhausted, refusing to sleep until Cherry gets back with the three cowboys who left. He wants to make sure no one else tries to leave. Hes sure once the three are returned and punished, no one else will leave.Cherry does come back, on the 4th day after he left, with two of the cowboys: Laredo and Teeler. Cherry said Kelsey chose not to return, so he had to shoot him. Dunson announces that he is going to hang the two. Matt tells him that he wont be doing that, and he will be the one to stop him. Dunson braces his right hand on a piece of wood to stand up and face Matt, but Matt shoots him in the hand. When Dunson tries to draw his gun, he isn't able to hold onto it and it falls to the ground. Dunson reaches down for it with his left hand and Buster shoots the gun away. Matt announces that hes taking over and will be taking the herd to Abilene. He says that Dunson will be left behind. Groot offers to stay with Dunson, but he tells Groot to go with the others. He then tells Matt that hell come after him and will kill him.Groot is later calculating how long before Dunson gets to another town, rounds up some new men, and catches up to them. For the next 2-3 weeks, everyone on the drive is nervous and jumpy, anticipating his return.One of the steers is found dead, filled with Apache arrows. Matt sends Buster and Cherry ahead 10 miles with rifles to scout and keep watch. Buster comes riding back all excited, with news that theres a wagon train about 18 miles ahead, the Donegal party, headed from New Orleans to Nevada, to set up a saloon for gambling, drinking and partying. He says there are dancing girls with the wagon train. Matt decides that the men need and deserve some distraction and decides to head the herd to the wagon train before continuing on to Abilene.As the herd approaches the wagon train, they hear shooting. The train is under attack by Apaches. Matt gives orders for the men to split into two groups and come at the Indians from the sides, while he and a few others ride down the middle. It takes some time to get all the men rounded up and ready, so Matt and the few others go ahead and ride straight to the wagons, jumping right into the middle of the circled wagons and helping fight the Indians who were circling around, yelping and shooting their arrows.Matt finds himself side by side with a very attractive woman who is firing a rifle (but not very well). Shes Tess Millay (Joanne Dru). He tells her to load and hell shoot. She perceives that hes angry about something and wants to know what. About that time, she takes an arrow to the right shoulder, pinning her to a wagon. Matt cuts the shaft so she is free from the wagon, but he has to finish the Indian fight before helping more. The rest of the men finally come charging down the hill and the men within the circle of wagons come charging out and the Apaches decide to hightail it.Matt returns to pull the arrow from Tesss shoulder, then he decides he needs to suck some poison out of the wound. She slaps him across the face for doing that, then passes out.Theres a big party that night, making use of the food, drinks, cards, and girls that are all available in the camp. Tess asks Groot to tell her all about Matt, because she ""needs to know."" She also wants to talk to Matt before they get back on the trail the next day. Groot goes and finds Matt (hes out in the evening fog, on watch) and tells Tess where he is. She goes out there and gets up close and starts talking to him. She tells him that he needs to talk to her, that talking about his concerns and fears is the way to deal with them. Matt doesnt need all that much convincing to talk, as she's a very soft and pretty girl that is very close to him. He opens up and they quickly get very comfortable with each other. Shed fallen in love with him immediately. He probably did too, but needed a bit of convincing that it would be ok to fall in love with a saloon girl.As its raining hard and there are worries about the level of the next river to be crossed. Matt decides they need to do it right away, even though its nighttime.Meanwhile, Dunson has gathered 8 new men and is on the chase. Nine days after the herd had left the wagon train, Dunson and his men come across the wagons. Tess immediately announces that shell ""take care of Mr. Dunson."" She considers shooting Dunson, as he sits in her tent talking to her, but he knows she has a pistol and is prepared to shoot her first if need be. It doesnt come to that. He notices shes wearing his mothers bracelet and asks her how she got it away from Matt. She sarcastically says she stole it, then admits she loves Matt and that he gave it to her.As they talk, Tess tells Dunson that she wanted to go with Matt on the drive, but he said no, it was too dangerous and tough. That reminded Dunson of the day when he turned down his womans request to go along with him. He was nevertheless bound and determined to go find and kill Matt, and tells Tess she cant say or do anything to change his mind. She keeps after him, though, and he acknowledges his disappointment in Matt, saying he was the son he never had and would stand to inherit his ranch if he hadnt betrayed him. Dunson takes a fresh look at Tess and offers her half of everything he owns in exchange for her bearing him a son. She says shell do it, if hell stop pursuing Matt. He says no, so she begs instead to be allowed to go with him. He says ok.Matts understandably stressed about whether they will find a railroad in Abilene, and the fact that Dunson is hot on his trail. Fortunately, they hear a train whistle in the distance and come across a train, about 12 miles from Abilene. The engineer is very thrilled to see the herd, as are the townspeople who come riding out to meet and greet them. They tell Matt to drive the herd right down Main Street so all the people can see (thats nearly impossible not to do anyway, as its a tiny town).Its August 14, 1865 and marks the time the first cattle drive on the Chisholm Trail is completed.In Abilene, Mr. Melville (Harry Carey Sr.) represents the Greenwood Trading Company of Illinois and offers immediately to buy the entire herd. Matt has no experience at selling cows, so hes hesitant to accept the $20/head offer. Mr. Melville then tells him to go out and find the best price he can for a lot of 500 cows and then hed match the price and still buy the whole herd. It ends up being $21/head. Matt signs the contract and receives a check for $50,000, with the balance to be paid once a final tally is arrived at. He makes sure all the cowboys get paid right away.Matt returns to his room at the Hotel Royale and is shocked to find Tess in there, all dressed in black. She apologizes for appearing as if shes in mourning. She tells him Dunson is camped outside town and will be coming to get him in the morning. It's likely that they get to know each other intimately that night.The next morning, everyone has gathered at the front of the hotel, waiting. Buster rushes in through the cows on his horse to announce that Dunson and his 10-12 men were riding in. Dunson, meanwhile, is telling his men to remember where they each stand in all this, which apparently is to hang well back and not interfere. Dunson dismounts on the far side of the railroad tracks and sets out with a very purposeful walk, through the cows and across the tracks. Cherry, realizing that Matt is not likely to draw and shoot it out with Dunson, confronts Dunson before he gets to Matt. They both draw and shoot, wounding each other. Cherry falls, but Dunson continues on. He gets close and tells Matt to draw, but Matt refuses. Dunson draws and empties his gun, shooting all around Matt, knocking his hat off and grazing his right cheek, drawing blood. He then walks up to Matt and wants to know what he has to do to make a man out of him. Dunson grabs and tosses away Matts gun. He reminds Matt that as a boy, he once told him never to try that again, but Matt doesn't react. Dunson then punches Matt in the face 2-3 times, knocking him down. He drags him back up, ready to hit some more, but Matt shocks him by punching him and knocking him down. They brawl until Tess fires a pistol into the air, stopping the action. She chews them out loudly for awhile, then decides maybe they should go ahead and pummel each other, and she turns away so they can continue. They don't start fighting again, however. Instead, they stand looking after Tess. Dunson tells Matt to marry that gal. Matt says, When are you going to stop telling people what to do? Dunson says, After one more thing. After we get back to Texas, Im going to make the brand the double bar D, with an additional name (he scrawls out an M in the dirt). You earned it!","
    
                    Fourteen years after starting his cattle ranch in Texas, Tom Dunston is finally ready to drive his 10,000 head of cattle to market. Back then Dunston, his sidekick Nadine Groot and a teen-aged boy, Matt Garth -who was the only survivor of an Indian attack on a wagon train - started off with only two head of cattle. The nearest market however is in Missouri, a 1000 miles away. Dunston is a hard task master demanding a great deal from the men who have signed up for the drive. Matt is a grown man now and fought in the Civil War. He has his own mind as well and he soon runs up against the stubborn Dunston who won't listen to advice from anyone. Soon, the men on the drive are taking sides and Matt ends up in charge with Dunston vowing to kill him.

                    In 1851 Tom Dunson and his old friend Groot are on their way to Texas to become settlers and raise cattle. They make a halt before crossing Red River, which runs along the Texan border. Suddenly an orphan boy, called Matt Garth, turns up, leading a cow. 14 years later Tom has a herd of 10,000 heads, and Matt is a young man, trained by Tom to become a skilled gunman. The Civil War has taken all money out of the South, so Tom is unable to sell any beef in Texas. In his desperate situation he decides to drive his herd the 1000 miles to Missouri, an almost impossible undertaking. After 60 days through desert country, little sleep and not much food left, his men are sullen and morose. When three of them try to desert, Tom shoots them. After the herd has crossed Red River, Tom's cowboys try to convince him to drive the herd to Kansas instead, on a safer trail, but Tom is stubborn and refuses. When he is going to hang two deserters, Matt stops him, takes over the leadership and turns the herd towards Abilene in Kansas. Tom says that he will stalk them and kill Matt.

                    By the end of the American Civil War in 1865, Thomas Dunson has managed to carve out his dream of being a cattle rancher in Texas, he having done so largely with the help of an old cowpoke named Nadine Groot, and a young man named Matthew Garth, who Dunson unofficially adopted when he was a boy. This dream has not been without some adversity in his life, such as the situation where he met Matt when the wagon train he and Groot had accompanied for some time from St. Louis in 1851 got ambushed by Indians, with Dunson's love, Fen, one of the victims, and it not being as easy to take over the unoccupied land north of the Rio Grande in west Texas where he eventually established the ranch. The result of the war has left most in the south cash poor, including Dunson, but there being a plenitude of men, ex-soldiers, willing to work as cowboys to rebuild lives for themselves and their families. Despite the potential hazards of the task including the fact that the Indians are still ambushing unsuspecting people, Dunson is able to find a group of men willing to accompany him, Groot and Matt on a potentially lucrative cattle drive to Missouri to sell the close to ten thousand head of cattle - which includes some cattle from neighboring ranchers to be sold on consignment - to the companies operating the stockades at the end of the known railroad line. As the drive progresses, Dunson becomes increasingly alienated from the other men, including Matt, for the unyielding ways in his singlemindedness of the task, regardless of anything else. Matt's generally softer stand as opposed to Dunson's ""shoot now to kill, ask questions later"" mentality Dunson sees as weakness on Matt's part. The two men will have to reconcile their growing adversarial nature against the fact that they truly do love each other as father and son if they are both to survive this drive and beyond, especially as they both live by the code of not standing down from their beliefs.

    Synopsis
    In 1851, Tom Dunson (John Wayne) and friend Nadine Groot (Walter Brennan), join a wagon train in St. Louis (or near St. Louis), headed for California. After three weeks, they approach north Texas, where the land looks good to Tom. He decides he wants to break away from the wagon train and go find a place to start a ranch of his own. The wagon master tries to order him to stay, then tries talking him out of it, all to no avail. Tom is also pretty handy with his fists and a gun, so there wouldnt be any forcing him. Along with Tom and Nadine on the trip to California is Fen (Colleen Gray), Toms love interest. He and Fen are basically engaged (in love, anyway) and she wants to come with Tom and Nadine to find a ranch. Tom wont hear of it, promising to send for her once hes settled in. She doesn't like the idea of having to wait, but promises to come. Before leaving, Tom gives Fen a bracelet that belonged to his mother.Tom and Nadine take off with their wagon, horse, one bull and two cows, and get maybe 10-15 miles from the wagon train, near the Red River, when they look back and see black smoke. Realizing that the wagon train has most likely been attacked by Indians, they know they cant get back in time to help, and that some of the Indians are likely to come looking for them soon enough anyway, so they set up in a defensive posture and wait.Sure enough, maybe 6-7 Indian braves show up and begin an attack with a fire arrow that hits Tom's and Nadine's wagon (but doesnt do much damage). Both Tom and Nadine are good shots and they kill most of the attackers right away. However, one of their cows was killed by the Indians and then Tom has to fight hand-to-hand. He kills one Indian as they fight and fall into the river. Tom notices the Indian he killed was wearing the bracelet hed given to Fey. Tom then sneaks out to kill the last one or two Indians of the group, who were still out there hiding. The next day, theres a young boy named Matt Garth (Mickey Kuhn) who comes strolling along leading a cow and talking to himself, like hes lost his mind. Tom slaps the kid to snap him out of his trance. The kid then pulls a hand gun and points it at Tom. Tom grabs the gun and takes it away, knocking the kid down. The kid is not crazy, but just play-acting. Tom tells him never to pull a gun on him again. The kid has spunk and tells Tom never to take his gun from him again. Tom turns to Nadine and says, hell do. Tom hands Matt's gun back to him and allows him to come with them. Apparently, the family or group Matt had been with was attacked by Indians too, so he had no one left.The three of them travel deep into Texas, stopping at the Rio Grande, where Tom pronounces himself the new owner of all the land visible north of the river. He also says that 10 years hence, hell have the biggest and best ranch in all of Texas, with plenty of beef to feed and nourish all the people around the area. He tells Garth and Groot that he will brand all the cattle in his future herd with a D double bar (the bars representing the banks of the Red River). Matt wants an M added to the brand, but Dunson says he'll have to earn it.Two Mexican men come riding up and introduce themselves as employees of Don Diego, the man who owns the land they are standing on. At that moment, Don Diego was at his ranch headquarters 400 miles south, in Mexico. Tom tells the two men to ride back and tell Don Diego that all the land north of the Rio Grande now belongs to him and hes taking it. One of the men says that just cant be and he goes for his gun. Tom outdraws him and shoots him dead. He tells the other man to take his friends horse and go back and tell Don Diego what happened. Tom told the guy that he would take care of burying the other man's body.Flash forward nearly 15 years later to find Tom, Nadine and a grown Matt (Montgomery Clift) having a discussion about Matts recent return to the ranch, and the major problem of there being no market in Texas for all of Toms thousands of cattle (thanks to the Civil War basically bankrupting everyone). The decision is that they will need to drive the cattle north instead, to Missouri, to sell them. Tom was going to make Nadine stay behind, as Nadine was getting too old to ride, but the trail cook had just quit, so Nadine got to go, as the cowboys would need a cook.Tom and Nadine had a funny exchange, right after Tom had told Nadine he had to stay behind. Nadine was talking to himself, complaining about the decision, while Tom was trying to talk to Matt. Tom finally turned to Nadine and asked him what he was saying and why didnt he have his new teeth in his mouth, because he couldnt understand his mumbling. Nadine responded that everyone else could understand him just fine and he was keeping his teeth in his pocket until he needed them for eating.Matt was overseeing the branding of the cattle, preparatory to the drive, and having the men turn loose any cows belonging to a rancher named Meeker (Davison Clark), or to Don Diego. Tom rides up and orders that no cattle be turned loose and that they all be branded with the D-Double Bar brand (his). Matt doesnt agree, but tells the men to go ahead and do as Tom says. About that time, Mr. Meeker rides up with some of his men, including a hired gun, and asks Tom for permission to look through the herd to cull out any of his cows. Tom denies permission, telling Meeker that hes branding all of the cows he has, regardless of any other brands they may already have on them. Things get pretty testy and Matt and Mr. Meekers gunfighter, Cherry Valance (John Ireland) exchange words. Matt has become very handy with a gun himself. Tom relents somewhat, in that he decides to offer Meeker $2/head for any of his cows that make it to Missouri and get sold. Meeker agrees. Cherry then decides hed like to work for Tom instead of Meeker and asks to be hired on. Tom hires him at $10/month, the going rate for a trail hand.Matt and Cherry are just itching to have a fight (preferably a gunfight), and Tom realizes its probably inevitable, but he forces them to get along for the time being. They do have an initial challenge contest, where they borrow each others guns and alternately shoot at a tin can, impressing each other with their respective skills.In the bunkhouse, theres a poker game the night before the drive starts. Quo (Chief Yowlachie) is sitting opposite Groot. Groot has a good hand, but when Quo bets one silver dollar, Groot is aghast. Thats equivalent to 3 days pay. He asks Matt to loan him a dollar, but Matt refuses. The rule of the game is that only whats on the table at the time can be used to bet with. So, Quo asks Groot whats in the small bag he has there on the table and Groot tells him it contains his false teeth. Quo says hell accept half interest in the teeth to cover the one dollar bet. Groot isn't happy about it, but he agrees. They show their cards. Quo has the better hand and demands the teeth. Groot wants to know how hes supposed to eat without his teeth and Quo tells him that come grub time, you get em.Dunson comes into the bunkhouse and tells everyone that its now or never as far as their decisions to go on the drive. He tells them that there will be no hard feelings for anyone who wants to stay behind, and promised them that theyd still have jobs on the ranch after the drive is over. He tells them that theyll be doing good to make 10 miles a day on the 1,000 mile drive, 15 miles if they are lucky. Theyll face bad weather, dust, Indians and border gangs (once they get close to Missouri). But, once a cowboy says hell go, hes expected to finish the drive, whatever happens. Dunson makes everyone going sign a piece of paper representing their word to stick it out.The next morning, breakfast was served at 4:30 and, with nearly 10,000 head of cattle grouped together, at 5 a.m., Dunson quietly told Matt to take 'em to Missouri. All the cowboys whooped and hollered as they started out. Quo holds Groot to the results of their bet, only loaning the false teeth back to Groot at mealtimes. Groot is not happy about that. He tells Quo that the teeth help him keep the dust out of his mouth. Quo tells him to keep his mouth shut then, and dust not get in. Groot complains that before the drive is over, hell probably eat enough land to get himself incorporated in the Union as the State of Groot. Quo still says no. Dunson isnt happy about the situation either, complaining that Groot mumbles and needs to have his teeth in to be understood. The men start talking about taking the cattle to Kansas instead of Missouri, as its closer and there are less hazards along the way. However, because no one has personal knowledge of a railway actually being in Abilene, KS (where rumor has it there was one), Dunson says to forget it.Dunson goes through 3-4 horses a day, so hes obviously very involved in the drive.The group is 30 days into the drive with no major issues. One cowboy remarks that he doesnt like that. It makes him nervous. He prefers a balance of things going well and having trouble, not just one or the other. The trouble part does come, and it starts as a result of Bunk Kenneally (Ivan Parry) continuing to get into the supply of sugar (he dips his fingers into the sack whenever he can, which gets him in trouble with Groot). Everyone has been on their best behavior as far as being quiet, because the cattle are on edge. They are tired and there are coyotes milling about. Everyone is worried that the cows will stampede if something spooks them. So, when Bunk clumsily knocks over some of the cook pots as hes getting into the sugar, thats enough noise to start a stampede.One of the cowboys prefers to wear a bowler hat. He gets trapped behind a shrub in the middle of the stampede, so Matt and another fellow ride up and each grab an arm of this fellow and they carry him off to the side of the stampeding cows and let him down.After the cows are stopped and calmed down, it's noticed that one of the wranglers, Dan Latimer (Harry Carey Jr.) is missing. Latimer wore checkered pants and would talk about using the $100 he would be earning on the drive to buy a place to farm/ranch, and a pair of red shoes for his wife. A search begins and they find what's left of Latimer's distinctive checkered pants among a bunch of dead cattle. Dunson tells Matt to make sure the widow gets Dans money and whatever else. Matt replies, like a pair of red shoes?Dunson reads over Latimer's remains the next morning and as he puts the Bible back on the wagon, he goes over and picks up Groots' whip, at the same time calling out to Bunk: Bunk Kennally, you started all this! 400 cows dead and Latimer too. Stealing sugar like a little kid. Well, we whip kids to punish them for things like that. Dunson tells Teeler to strap Bunk to a wagon wheel. Before Teeler can do that, Bunk speaks up and acknowledges that he is remorseful about Latimer and the dead cows, but he tells Dunson he wont stand to be whipped. As he goes for his gun, hed likely have been shot dead by Dunson, but Matt draws first and shoots Bunk in the shoulder, saving his life. Dunson turns to Matt and says, you shot him, you take care of him!Matt provides Bunk with two horses and sends him back home. Cherry observes all this and tells Matt that while hes real fast with a gun, hes got a soft heart, and that will get him hurt some day. Matt says that could be, but not to count on it.40 days out, with reduced rations (after one wagon was destroyed in the stampede), the men become increasingly restless. Tom reminds them that they all signed on to see it through, like it or not. A cowboy named Sutter (William Self) rides up, his head bandaged and barely able to talk (there was a rope burn around his neck), saying he had been riding with the Garwood herd (2,000 cows) when they were ambushed by about 100 bandits. Hearing that, Naylor, Fernandez and another hand tell Dunson theyve had enough (but not until right after theyd watched Dunson set his gun belt down as he was preparing to go get some water). Dunson tells them they cant go. They reach for their guns as Groot tosses a loaded and cocked rifle to Dunson. Dunson's shots, in combination with those fired by Matt and Cherry, kill the three wranglers.Dunson orders the three buried, announcing that hell read over them in the morning. That prompts one of the cowboys to say: Plantin and readin, plantin and readin. Why, when youve killed a man, why try to read the Lord in as a partner in the job?Matt argues with Dunson over the need to confront and kill the three men. He and Groot both tell Dunson hes wrong to do such things. Groot then patches up a bullet wound on Dunsons lower left leg.That night, Teeler, Kelsey and Laredo are on watch, when they decide to take some ammunition and flour and ride out, headed back home. The next morning, Dunson sends Cherry and Buster to go get the three and bring them back, dead or alive.The herd arrives at the Red River. Matt wants to give everyone a rest and cross the river first thing in the morning. Dunson will have none of that, and orders the crossing to begin immediately. He finds a couple areas of quicksand in the river to be avoided then orders the crossing to start. The process continues into the night. Between 30-40 head are lost during the process. Dunson is limping badly and pulls heavily from a bottle of whiskey once he sits down to rest. Hes exhausted, refusing to sleep until Cherry gets back with the three cowboys who left. He wants to make sure no one else tries to leave. Hes sure once the three are returned and punished, no one else will leave.Cherry does come back, on the 4th day after he left, with two of the cowboys: Laredo and Teeler. Cherry said Kelsey chose not to return, so he had to shoot him. Dunson announces that he is going to hang the two. Matt tells him that he wont be doing that, and he will be the one to stop him. Dunson braces his right hand on a piece of wood to stand up and face Matt, but Matt shoots him in the hand. When Dunson tries to draw his gun, he isn't able to hold onto it and it falls to the ground. Dunson reaches down for it with his left hand and Buster shoots the gun away. Matt announces that hes taking over and will be taking the herd to Abilene. He says that Dunson will be left behind. Groot offers to stay with Dunson, but he tells Groot to go with the others. He then tells Matt that hell come after him and will kill him.Groot is later calculating how long before Dunson gets to another town, rounds up some new men, and catches up to them. For the next 2-3 weeks, everyone on the drive is nervous and jumpy, anticipating his return.One of the steers is found dead, filled with Apache arrows. Matt sends Buster and Cherry ahead 10 miles with rifles to scout and keep watch. Buster comes riding back all excited, with news that theres a wagon train about 18 miles ahead, the Donegal party, headed from New Orleans to Nevada, to set up a saloon for gambling, drinking and partying. He says there are dancing girls with the wagon train. Matt decides that the men need and deserve some distraction and decides to head the herd to the wagon train before continuing on to Abilene.As the herd approaches the wagon train, they hear shooting. The train is under attack by Apaches. Matt gives orders for the men to split into two groups and come at the Indians from the sides, while he and a few others ride down the middle. It takes some time to get all the men rounded up and ready, so Matt and the few others go ahead and ride straight to the wagons, jumping right into the middle of the circled wagons and helping fight the Indians who were circling around, yelping and shooting their arrows.Matt finds himself side by side with a very attractive woman who is firing a rifle (but not very well). Shes Tess Millay (Joanne Dru). He tells her to load and hell shoot. She perceives that hes angry about something and wants to know what. About that time, she takes an arrow to the right shoulder, pinning her to a wagon. Matt cuts the shaft so she is free from the wagon, but he has to finish the Indian fight before helping more. The rest of the men finally come charging down the hill and the men within the circle of wagons come charging out and the Apaches decide to hightail it.Matt returns to pull the arrow from Tesss shoulder, then he decides he needs to suck some poison out of the wound. She slaps him across the face for doing that, then passes out.Theres a big party that night, making use of the food, drinks, cards, and girls that are all available in the camp. Tess asks Groot to tell her all about Matt, because she ""needs to know."" She also wants to talk to Matt before they get back on the trail the next day. Groot goes and finds Matt (hes out in the evening fog, on watch) and tells Tess where he is. She goes out there and gets up close and starts talking to him. She tells him that he needs to talk to her, that talking about his concerns and fears is the way to deal with them. Matt doesnt need all that much convincing to talk, as she's a very soft and pretty girl that is very close to him. He opens up and they quickly get very comfortable with each other. Shed fallen in love with him immediately. He probably did too, but needed a bit of convincing that it would be ok to fall in love with a saloon girl.As its raining hard and there are worries about the level of the next river to be crossed. Matt decides they need to do it right away, even though its nighttime.Meanwhile, Dunson has gathered 8 new men and is on the chase. Nine days after the herd had left the wagon train, Dunson and his men come across the wagons. Tess immediately announces that shell ""take care of Mr. Dunson."" She considers shooting Dunson, as he sits in her tent talking to her, but he knows she has a pistol and is prepared to shoot her first if need be. It doesnt come to that. He notices shes wearing his mothers bracelet and asks her how she got it away from Matt. She sarcastically says she stole it, then admits she loves Matt and that he gave it to her.As they talk, Tess tells Dunson that she wanted to go with Matt on the drive, but he said no, it was too dangerous and tough. That reminded Dunson of the day when he turned down his womans request to go along with him. He was nevertheless bound and determined to go find and kill Matt, and tells Tess she cant say or do anything to change his mind. She keeps after him, though, and he acknowledges his disappointment in Matt, saying he was the son he never had and would stand to inherit his ranch if he hadnt betrayed him. Dunson takes a fresh look at Tess and offers her half of everything he owns in exchange for her bearing him a son. She says shell do it, if hell stop pursuing Matt. He says no, so she begs instead to be allowed to go with him. He says ok.Matts understandably stressed about whether they will find a railroad in Abilene, and the fact that Dunson is hot on his trail. Fortunately, they hear a train whistle in the distance and come across a train, about 12 miles from Abilene. The engineer is very thrilled to see the herd, as are the townspeople who come riding out to meet and greet them. They tell Matt to drive the herd right down Main Street so all the people can see (thats nearly impossible not to do anyway, as its a tiny town).Its August 14, 1865 and marks the time the first cattle drive on the Chisholm Trail is completed.In Abilene, Mr. Melville (Harry Carey Sr.) represents the Greenwood Trading Company of Illinois and offers immediately to buy the entire herd. Matt has no experience at selling cows, so hes hesitant to accept the $20/head offer. Mr. Melville then tells him to go out and find the best price he can for a lot of 500 cows and then hed match the price and still buy the whole herd. It ends up being $21/head. Matt signs the contract and receives a check for $50,000, with the balance to be paid once a final tally is arrived at. He makes sure all the cowboys get paid right away.Matt returns to his room at the Hotel Royale and is shocked to find Tess in there, all dressed in black. She apologizes for appearing as if shes in mourning. She tells him Dunson is camped outside town and will be coming to get him in the morning. It's likely that they get to know each other intimately that night.The next morning, everyone has gathered at the front of the hotel, waiting. Buster rushes in through the cows on his horse to announce that Dunson and his 10-12 men were riding in. Dunson, meanwhile, is telling his men to remember where they each stand in all this, which apparently is to hang well back and not interfere. Dunson dismounts on the far side of the railroad tracks and sets out with a very purposeful walk, through the cows and across the tracks. Cherry, realizing that Matt is not likely to draw and shoot it out with Dunson, confronts Dunson before he gets to Matt. They both draw and shoot, wounding each other. Cherry falls, but Dunson continues on. He gets close and tells Matt to draw, but Matt refuses. Dunson draws and empties his gun, shooting all around Matt, knocking his hat off and grazing his right cheek, drawing blood. He then walks up to Matt and wants to know what he has to do to make a man out of him. Dunson grabs and tosses away Matts gun. He reminds Matt that as a boy, he once told him never to try that again, but Matt doesn't react. Dunson then punches Matt in the face 2-3 times, knocking him down. He drags him back up, ready to hit some more, but Matt shocks him by punching him and knocking him down. They brawl until Tess fires a pistol into the air, stopping the action. She chews them out loudly for awhile, then decides maybe they should go ahead and pummel each other, and she turns away so they can continue. They don't start fighting again, however. Instead, they stand looking after Tess. Dunson tells Matt to marry that gal. Matt says, When are you going to stop telling people what to do? Dunson says, After one more thing. After we get back to Texas, Im going to make the brand the double bar D, with an additional name (he scrawls out an M in the dirt). You earned it!

When the adolescent Nels declares his desire to attend high school, Marta is pleased, but realizes their ""little bank"" lacks sufficient funds to pay for his education. After each family member offers to make a monetary sacrifice so that Nels may continue his schooling, Trina, Marta's spinster sister, drops by to speak privately with Marta. To Marta's surprise, Trina announces that she is marrying Peter Thorkelson, a homely undertaker, and begs Marta to break the news to their sisters, Sigrid and Jenny, who Trina fears will laugh at her. As predicted, the bossy Jenny and whiny Sigrid laugh upon hearing of the engagement, but when Marta threatens to reveal embarrassing anecdotes about them to Trina, the sisters agree to keep quiet. Later that evening, Jonathan Hyde, the Hansons' erudite, penniless lodger, reads to them from Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities , and the entire family, especially fledgling writer Katrin, is deeply moved by the story. Soon after, the family is visited by Marta's overbearing but big-hearted uncle, Chris Halvorsen, who drives into the city with his common law wife, Jessie Brown. When the lame Chris, whose loud, gruff ways strike fear in the Hanson children, learns that Dagmar, the youngest daughter, is severely ill with mastoiditis, he insists on driving her to the hospital. Because they disapprove of Jessie, Sigrid and Jenny attempt to stop Chris, but he bullies his way past them with Dagmar and Marta in tow. Then the meek Trina and Peter reveal their engagement to Chris, the family's head, and are relieved to receive his blessing. Although Dagmar's operation is a success, Marta is forbidden to see her by the hospital staff. At home, Marta, who promised Dagmar she would visit immediately after the operation, becomes increasingly agitated about the separation and begins scrubbing the floor nervously. Marta's scrubbing inspires a plan: Impersonating a floor-scrubbing maid at the hospital, Marta sneaks into Dagmar's ward and sings a Norwegian lullaby to help her frightened daughter fall asleep. Sometime later, when a recovered Dagmar returns home, she learns that her cat, Uncle Elizabeth, is very ill. Despite Dagmar's belief in her mother's curative powers, Marta feels helpless to save the wounded cat and sends Nels to buy some chloroform with which to kill it. The other children, meanwhile, see Mr. Hyde leaving the house with his suitcases, and Marta discovers that he has left them a check for his overdue rent, as well as his book collection. The family's joy at receiving Mr. Hyde's check is soon undone when Sigrid and Jenny inform them that their lodger has no bank account. Although Sigrid and Jenny are indignant over Mr. Hyde's deception, wise Marta declares that his gift of literature is payment enough. Marta then applies the chloroform to Uncle Elizabeth, but is astounded when, the next morning, an unsuspecting Dagmar marches off with a sleepy but very alive cat. Later, as Katrin nears her school graduation date, she brags to Christine that Marta is going to buy her a much-coveted dresser set as a present. Although the younger, envious Christine tells her that Marta is planning to give her their grandmother's brooch, Katrin does receive the dresser set. As Katrin is about to leave to perform ""Portia"" in her school's production of The Merchant of Venice , however, Christine informs her that Marta sold her beloved brooch in order to buy the dresser set. Crushed by this revelation, Katrin performs badly in the play, and later presents her mother with her brooch, which she exchanged for the dresser set. Touched by Katrin's gesture, Marta gives her the brooch and scolds Christine for telling. Then, to mark her entrance into adulthood, Katrin's father serves her coffee for the first time. Sometime later, Marta is notified that Uncle Chris is near death, and she takes Katrin to say goodbye to him at his ranch. The alcoholic but still feisty Uncle Chris reveals to Marta that he has no money to leave her, and confesses that he and Jessie have been married for years but have been silent about it because of his nieces' snubbing.

Mama is the practical one in the family. One of the family's rituals is doing the household financial accounts every Saturday night. Using the money brought home by Papa and what is kept in their petty cash tin, Mama would allocate it to the weekly bills. ""It's good - we do not have to go to the bank"" is what Mama would say if they had enough money. Luckily, they never had to go to the bank as dipping into their bank account was the worst thing they could have done. Beyond her practicality, Mama is truthful and compassionate and will do anything for those she loves. This not only includes her husband and children, but also her ""scary"" Uncle Chris, her trio of sisters - all four of whom can be difficult to love much of the time - and their poor boarder, Mr. Hyde, who provides more to the family in his readings than any financial compensation ever could. But Katrin and her siblings learn of a lie told by Mama, all in the name of protecting them.

    Synopsis
    Upon completing the last lines of her autobiographical novel, youthful Katrin Hanson reminisces about her family life: In 1910, in a modest San Francisco house, Katrin's Norwegian-born mother, Marta Hanson, computes the weekly budget with help from her husband Lars, daughters Katrin, Christine and Dagmar and son Nels.

"10","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040506/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film opens with an aerial scene of the Florida Keys in the 1940s. Scrolling text says: At the southernmost point of the United States are the Florida Keys, a string of small islands held together by a concrete causeway. Largest of these remote coral islands is Key Largo.A bus is crossing a bridge and is overtaken by a sheriff's car, which pulls the bus over. Sheriff Ben Wade (Monte Blue) speaks to the driver through the window while Deputy Clyde Sawyer (John Rodney) walks through the bus. Sheriff Wade advises the driver they are looking for a couple of Indians that broke out of jail and describes them as young bucks in fancy shirts. He asks the driver to phone his office if he sees them. After the police leave, the driver turns and tells Major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) seated behind him that the Indians must be from around here, as they always return home. ""Home being Key Largo"", says McCloud.The bus resumes its trip and pulls up at the Largo Hotel. A sign indicates ""Largo Hotel - James Temple, Proprietor"". McCloud departs the bus and walks into the hotel. A man (Harry Lewis) is reading the paper in the lobby, but no one else is around. Frank rings the bell at the front desk. The man reading the paper asks Frank if he wants something and Frank asks for Mr. Temple. The paper-reader tells him he isn't here, the hotel is closed, and he doesnt know when Mr. Temple will be back. Frank wanders into the adjacent bar to find a woman and several men listening to a radio. Frank asks for a beer and is told by the people at the bar, and again by the paper-reader who followed him in, that the hotel is closed in the summer, everything is closed. The woman, however, insists that the man standing behind the bar give Frank a drink, which he reluctantly does.Frank thanks the woman and sits down next to her, where he sees she is clearly intoxicated. She is glued to the radio and listening to a horse race, following along on a racing form. The buzzer behind the bar goes off and a man at the bar says ""that's him"", whereupon the man behind the bar pours a drink and hands it to paper-reader. The woman says she'll bring it up, but the man seated at the bar says ""when he wants you he'll send for you"". The woman engages Frank in speculation about the next race and tells the man behind the bar, who we now know as Angel (Dan Seymour), to give Frank another drink. Frank lights a cigarette as the drunk woman rambles on about her handicapping strategy. She asks Frank his name and he tells her, along with his breeding lineage. She introduces herself as Dawn. Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor). Meanwhile, paper-reader returns from upstairs and tells Gaye ""he wants you"". She excuses herself and stumbles through the lobby, making up her face as she goes.The men at the bar ask who Frank is, and tell him once again that the hotel is closed and wont be open for another month. Frank asks them what they're doing here, and they say they are here by special arrangement. Frank says he is not interested in staying, he just wants to see Mr. Temple. One of the men at the bar tells him hes out at the boathouse. Frank picks up his hat and bag and heads out.Out on the pier behind the hotel he meets James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), who is wheelchair-bound. When Frank introduces himself, Mr. Temple yells for his daughter Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall), who is tying up a small boat at the pier. Mr. Temple introduces Nora as George's wife and Frank tells her that he and her husband were in the same outfit overseas. The three make small talk about life in the Keys and Frank tells them he knows a lot about the Keys from conversations with George. Frank tells them he is just passing through on his way to Key West, but at Mr. Temple's insistence, agrees to stay the night in George's old room.As Nora heads back inside, she passes Sheriff Wade and Deputy Sawyer, who have just arrived. The police ask Mr. Temple if hes seen the Osceola brothers. He tells them no, and introduces Frank as his son's Commanding Officer. Deputy Sawyer tells Mr. Temple they want to look around for the Osceola brothers, and Mr. Temple tells them they are not there and suggests he look for them in the mangroves or in the water, or wait for them to give themselves up. Deputy Sawyer insists, but Sheriff Wade tells him that Mr. Temple's word is good enough for him, and the policemen depart. Mr. Temple tells Frank that the two Indian brothers grew up with his son George and were good people who did nothing more than get drunk and stir up some trouble in Palm Grove. He says that he's sent word for them to give themselves up - ""not that I know where they are, mind you"".Temple and Frank head back inside, where Temple formally introduces paper-reader to Frank as Edward Bass, and the man behind the bar as Angel Garcia. Temple tells the men that Frank was his son's Commanding Officer in the Italian campaign and that George was killed in the Italian campaign.Suddenly there is a disturbance from upstairs, Gaye screams, and the third man from the bar is seen shoving Gaye into a room. Frank asks why he hit her and he tells Frank shes a lush and that a sock in the kisser is the only thing that will bring her out of it. Nora tells Frank his room is ready and takes him there.Alone with Nora, Frank asks her about the guests, and Nora tells him the one they just saw, Richard ""Curly"" Hoff (Thomas Gomez) and Gaye got there first about a week ago. The Temples told them they were closed, but were offered so much money for a week they could not turn it down. Mr. Brown and the others arrived in a big boat four days ago. Frank asks which one is Brown, and Nora tells him he's in room 11 but only comes out at night, and he must be rich because the others jump at his command. Frank thinks it's odd that they chose to set down in Key Largo in this time of year with the extreme heat. Nora says they'll be leaving in a day or two so she doesnt care.Nora asks Frank if he was with George when he died and Frank tells her yes, but George did not suffer and never knew what hit him. Nora leaves Frank, and Curly stops in to introduce himself and apologizes for the brusque treatment in the bar. He explains they are here on a fishing trip from Milwaukee, a trip they planned for a year, and one guy screwed up the whole trip by bringing a lush woman with him. He says the woman spoiled the whole trip. Frank mostly ignores him coming down the stairs, apparently not happy about his treatment of Gaye in the upstairs hall. Curly offers him a drink, but Frank declines. Meanwhile, Nora takes a call and finds that a hurricane is on its way. She leads Frank to Mr. Temple's room.Temple and Nora ask Frank about George, as all they had was a letter from the War Department. Frank tells the Temples that George was a born-hero and tells them a few stories about George's heroism in Italy. He tells them that George talked incessantly about the Temples, including telling Frank some personal stories about Nora and his father that Frank relates to them. James asks where George is buried and Frank describes it. The Temples express their gratitude to Frank, who takes his leave.With the storm coming, Frank and Nora head out to secure some boats, and Nora asks what brought Frank to the islands. Frank says he is thinking of maybe settling down and making a living there. As they approach the boats, Curly shows up and introduces Frank to another member of their party, Ralph Feeney (William Haade). Frank and Nora secure a boat to the pier. Nora asks where Frank learned about boats and Frank tells her his first sweetheart was a boat. Curly asks Frank what he thinks about a large boat just offshore and Frank tells him its a nice boat, but should be secured away from the reef with the storm coming. Nora watches Frank with admiration as he ties up the Temples' boat. As they finish up, an Indian family arrives in several small boats, including a very old woman (Felipa Gomez). Nora explains that the Indians often stay with them when theres a storm. The last two Indians off the boat are Tom Osceola (Jay Silverheels) and John Osceola (Rodd Redwing) the Indians the sheriff is looking for. The Osceolas tell Nora they are here to give themselves up to the police, if thats what Mr. Temple thinks is right. Nora tells them to go inside and her Dad will call up to Palm Grove.Nora and Frank make small talk about how she met George. Meanwhile, the wind starts to blow and it begins to storm. Nora heads inside to start preparing for the storm as the fishing party mills about in the lobby and bar. Once again Curly tries to get Frank to drink with him. Ralph is obviously concerned about the hurricane, but Curly makes light of it and mocks Ralph.Mr. Temple comes into the lobby escorted by the Osceola brothers. He asks if anyone has seen Sheriff Wade, as his car is outside. Mr. Temple tells the Osceolas that maybe THEY should go looking for the Sheriff instead. Ed Bass, who Curly calls ""Toots"", reads the paper and tells silly jokes from the paper. Mr. Temple asks Frank, who is securing some doors, if he has seen the police, and Curly once again tries to get everyone to have a drink. The Temples and Frank once again decline. As Nora continues to prepare, Curly tells Ralph to go put up the windows in the car, but Ralph, obviously even more concerned, says ""no way"".The phone rings and Curly tells no one to answer it. He answers it himself and tells the caller that Mr. Temple is not here, and neither is Nora. Mr. Temple and Nora approach and Curly tells the caller that if Sawyer shows up he'll have him call right back. Nora tries for the phone, Curly snatches it away, and when Frank moves on Curly, both Curly and Toots pull guns on him.The scene switches to a man in a bathtub (Edward G. Robinson), reading a paper, smoking a cigar and having a drink. He gets out of the tub as Curly enters his room and tells him that the soldier tried to get rough with them, and they had to show him their guns. The man puts on a robe as Curly tells him it was the law on the phone looking for Sawyer. We then see that Sawyer, who has apparently chosen to ignore Sheriff Wade's direction to not snoop around, is in the bather's room, bleeding from the head, and we now realize that the call was apparently Sheriff Wade looking for him.Mr. Temple calls for Brown, the man in the tub, and with the whole gang in the lobby, verbally accosts them and ridicules them. He asks if they are thieves here to rob him, to which Toots replies ""thats right, we're here to steal all your towels"". Brown tells them that he doesnt want any trouble for anyone and asks Temple to act sensible; he'll be gone in a couple hours. He tells Temple that they will be HIS guest for a little while.Meanwhile, Sawyer begins to come around and walks out of Brown's room into the lobby, to the surprise of Temple and Nora. He says ""you wont get away with this, Rocco"" and is tripped and sent sprawling by Toots. Realization dawns on Frank's face as Temple asks why they hurt Sawyer (""because hes a cop""), and Frank suddenly recognizes Mr. Brown as Johnny Rocco.Frank tells Mr. Temple that Johnny Rocco is a notorious gangster. Temple says they threw Rocco out of the country. Temple then tells Rocco he should have been exterminated not deported, and Frank intervenes on Temple's behalf and flatters Rocco for his success in everything from running numbers to booze, as he built his criminal empire. Rocco, flattered, ignores Temple. Temple, however, continues to verbally assault Rocco as Frank continues to try and shield the Temples from Rocco.Rocco questions Frank about his war service and Frank downplays his role and says he was no hero and that he only did what he had to do in the war. Meanwhile, Rocco and Temple trade verbal assaults. Rocco taunts Temple until he rises from his chair and collapses trying to hit him. Nora tries to attack Rocco, scratching his face, but Rocco pins her arms behind her and kisses her instead. Ralph then arrives and tells Rocco that Miami wants him on the phone. Rocco departs and Frank and Nora help Temple back to his chair.Ralph tells Rocco a bunch of Indians want in from the storm and Rocco tells Ralph not to let them in. Rocco takes the call, from a man named ""Ziggy"". There is a knock on the door and Ralph answers it. It's the skipper of the boat he arrived in (Alberto Morin) and Ralph lets him in, but pushes the waiting Indians back outside. Meanwhile, Rocco is just hearing about the hurricane on the phone, but tells Ziggy ""it's got to be tonight"" and he'd see him in a couple hours.The Skipper tells Rocco that the boat must leave now, the storm is too dangerous. Rocco threatens him with a gun and the Skipper acquiesces and tells him OK.Meanwhile, Sawyer is telling the group that he came back looking for the Osceola boys. He says he ran into Toots and Curly in the lobby, grew suspicious, and put in a call to Sheriff Wade, but the lines went out before the call went through, and the next thing he remembers, he awoke in Rocco's room where he was promptly knocked out again.Rocco re-enters and tells the gang that everything is OK in Miami, and that the folks in Miami are leaving right away. He tells Sawyer that he's surprised that he EVER woke up after the way Toots worked him over. He sits down to have Angel give him a shave as he continues to taunt Sawyer about not being able to take him down. Rocco tells him he was too much for the big city and federal cops, and no hick cop like him will take him down. Rocco tells stories of how he once controlled politicians and cops alike. He rises from his shave, sees Nora in the mirror and tells how he once knew a ""wildcat like her"" named Maggie Mooney, but he had to change her name for professional reasons and that she was now Gaye Dawn. Rocco then approaches Nora and whispers in her ear. Nora is obviously revolted, but Rocco follows her as she walks away and whispers to her again. She turns to confront him and Temple tries to rise from his chair but is restrained by Toots. Rocco spins Nora around to face him and she spits in his face.Frank comes and leads Rocco away as Temple taunts him further. Frank tells Rocco to come on over, he'd like to spit on him too. Rocco, his rage building, tells Curly to give him a gun, which he does. The gang tells Rocco to smack Nora, but Frank tells the gang that spanking isnt good enough for Rocco, he wants to kill her, but if he killed her he'd have to kill all the witnesses too, including the gang. But he needs the gang, so he wont kill anyone just yet. Rocco is upset that Frank sees through him. Curly commends Frank for defusing the situation.Meanwhile, Gaye returns and wants to know what's going on and wants to start drinking again. It appears that she's missed the past several hours as she doesnt know whats going on. She is growing agitated from not having a drink, but Angel tells her the boss said no more. She gets upset and begins to curse Rocco, but just then, he re-enters the room, having dressed. Gaye sees the scratch on his face from Nora, and suddenly realizes what she missed.Rocco confronts Frank and asks him if he has a million dollars. When Frank says no, Rocco asks him why not, he thought he was a wise guy, and Frank says its because he was educated in the practical things, unlike Rocco who was just the opposite. Suddenly the wind blows a window open. Rocco wonders aloud if a car can get through the storm, and Gaye tries once again for a drink.Rocco and Frank continue to feel each other out. Frank tells Rocco that all he wants is more, more, more and that all he wants, himself, is a world where there is no place for the Johnny Roccos. Rocco offers to give him his chance and hands Frank a gun while pulling one of his own. He tells Frank here's his chance to get his wish, but he's got to die for it, as Rocco is aiming at his belly. He taunts Frank to shoot him as Temple tells him to kill him. Rocco taunts and taunts, and Frank is egged on by Sawyer as well. Rocco tells Frank he must not want it enough, and Frank throws the gun down, saying ""one Rocco, more or less, isnt worth dying for.""Temple says to give HIM the gun, and Rocco says no, he's afraid he'd use it and one old man, more or less, isnt worth dying for. Rocco insinuates that Frank is a coward and that's how he survived the war. Suddenly, Sawyer springs to his feet and grabs the gun Frank discarded and levels it at Rocco. He backs toward the door and tells Rocco he can stop him, but HE'S got to die first. He tells Toots and Angel to get out of his way and continues toward the door, holding the gun on Rocco. As Sawyer gets to the door and opens it, Rocco shoots him. Sawyer shoots back, only to find that the gun he has, the one that Rocco gave to Frank, is not loaded. Rocco shoots him again and he falls out of the doorway. Rocco tells Nora that yes, the gun wasn't loaded, but ""our hero didn't know it"". Temple says Frank knew the gun wasn't loaded, Frank said he did not, Toots said Frank was just a coward, but Gaye gets it right and says that Frank was smart, because he knew what happened to Sawyer would have happened to him and ""it's better to be a live coward than a dead hero"".Curly and Angel take Sawyer's body out in a boat to dump it at sea, while Ralph cleans up the mess where Sawyer fell dead. The phone rings and Rocco answers it. It's Ziggy, and Rocco is upset because Ziggy is not there yet. He says he risked his neck to come from Cuba with ""the shipment"" and he knows a dozen guys who will take it if Ziggy isnt there by ten o'clock, two hours from now. The power then goes out in the hotel and Toots herds everyone downstairs at gunpoint. Gaye makes her way to the bar and pours a drink, but Rocco tells her he told her no drinking. Angel and Curly return from disposing of Sawyer and Rocco tells them to go get the shipment.Rocco pours out Gaye's drink and tells the whole crew, now assembled in the bar, how she's an alcoholic and if there's one thing he can't stand its a dame that's a lush. She wasn't like that eight years ago. She tells him he hasn't changed and is still as mean as can be. Rocco says that reminds him of a song she used to sing, and humiliates her about how she could have been a star. He tells her if she sings her old song he will let her have a drink. Gaye tells the group about her days as a singer and starts singing Billie Holiday's song ""Moanin' Low"". She sings very poorly and humiliates herself even further, to the bemusement of Rocco. When she finishes, she runs to the bar for her drink, but Rocco denies her anyway. Frank then goes behind the bar, pours a scotch and gives it to Gaye who slams it down. Rocco slaps Frank three times in the face. Frank ignores Rocco and tells Gaye she's welcome.As Toots and Curly sit down to play gin and wait, the hurricane gets worse and the building starts shaking. Rocco asks Temple ""how bad can it get?"", and Temple tells Rocco of the hurricane of 1935 that had 200mph wind and killed 800 people. Nora apologizes, quietly, to Frank for calling him a coward and he tells her he's not a hero. But she tells him that she knows otherwise, and she knows from George's letters that Frank was really the hero that Frank told her George was.With the storm worsening, Rocco begins to get more and more worried and nervous. The hotel creaks and shakes and Frank smiles as he senses Rocco's fear. Rocco tells Temple he's a liar, that the story of the 1935 hurricane never happened. Temple plays on his fear and tells him how the storm was so strong it blew a train off the tracks. Frank taunts Rocco and asks him why he doesn't just show the storm his gun and threaten to shoot IT. Temple prays for a wave to kill them all. Rocco pulls his gun on Temple, but Frank intervenes as Rocco puts the gun in Frank's belly and pulls the trigger, but Rocco apparently has the unloaded gun now. The tension is broken as a tree comes crashing through a window. The scene switches to outside and we see waves crashing over the island and the Indians huddling on the hotel's porch begging to be let in.Back inside the hotel, some time has passed and the storm is abating. Frank tells Nora pretty soon nothing will be left but some trash on the beach. Nora asks if she'll ever see Frank again, and Temple tells Frank he'd be honored if he came down, as he considers him family. It is then that Toots comes into the lobby yelling for the boss to tell him that the boat is gone. The skipper has apparently taken off without Rocco and the gang, who are now stranded in Key Largo. Rocco says not to worry, there is another boat out there and that Frank will run it for them.The Osceola brothers appear at the door, yelling at Mr. Temple for denying their family shelter from the storm. Rocco had told Temple he sent them away. Temple tells Rocco they could have died out there, but Rocco does not care. He turns to Frank and tells him that he will be taking them to Cuba. Frank says he will not, and Rocco will not kill him because hes the only way off the island. Rocco then threatens him with beating and torture at the hands of Toots.There is a knock on the door and it is Sheriff Wade asking for Temple. Nora answers the door and lets him in. Wade, it turns out, is looking for Sawyer, and Nora tells him they havent seen him. Wade says that's funny, because Sawyer called from there a short time ago. No one in the hotel speaks up and Wade's suspicion grows. Curly suggests that Sawyer must have stopped in, called, then left and is stuck in the storm. Wade then asks if they've seen the Osceolas, who they all deny having seen, as well.Wade leaves the hotel and as he gets back in his car and turns on the lights, he sees Sawyer's body, which the storm has carried back ashore. He investigates and sees that Sawyer has been shot several times. As he heads back for the hotel, he speaks to Rocco, who the Sheriff thinks is ""Mr. Brown"". Rocco tells him he didn't want to rat out the Temples, but the Indians were there during the storm, had just left. He insinuates the Osceolas killed Sawyer. Sheriff Wade runs toward the pier and encounters the Indians. He finds the Osceolas, who take off running. Wade shoots both of them dead.Rocco comes back into the hotel and is followed, after a few minutes, by Sheriff Wade, who tells them that their Indian friends killed Sawyer. He tells Temple he will hold him accountable as an accessory to the murder. Wade then tells Temple he killed the Osceola brothers. Wade begins to take a report and questions Rocco and his gang. He also questions Frank, whose anger is beginning to visibly show.As Wade questions the hotel group, Ziggy and his gang finally arrive, pretending to be tourists, and Sheriff Wade takes his leave. Toots herds Frank and the Temples into another room as Rocco and Ziggy exchange pleasantries and laughs. Curly retrieves the package for Ziggy and opens it up to reveal a large pile of money. Ziggy examines it, and it's clear it is counterfeit money that Rocco has had printed for Ziggy. Satisfied with the product, Ziggy pays Rocco with a bag of (presumably) real money.While the transaction is going down, in the other room, Gaye and Nora implore Frank to not go with Rocco as Rocco will kill him. They urge him to make a break for it in the dark. Frank tells them that his head tells him to do that, but his heart tells him otherwise.The transaction concluded, Ziggy and his gang take their leave. Rocco tells Ralph to bring everything down, including the soldier's gear. He asks Frank one last time if he will take them, and tells Toots to work him over. Frank relents and says he will come along. Rocco asks Nora if she wants to come too, but she ignores him, and stares at Frank. Rocco puts on his coat and slips a gun into the pocket. Gaye asks where her things are, and Rocco tells her she isnt going back with him, gives her some money and tells her ""that ought to be enough to stay drunk for a good long time"".Gaye lunges for Rocco, hangs all over him, and begs him to take her with him. She promises to stop drinking and threatens to commit suicide if he leaves her. She claws at him repeatedly, but he finally pushes her away where she runs into Frank and we see she has taken the gun from Rocco's pocket. She slips it to Frank, who hides it in his hat. The gang depart and head for the Temples' boat. Nora and Gaye watch to see if Frank makes a break for it, but he does not and gets on the boat with the gang.Frank takes command of the boat and they depart the dock as Nora and Gaye return to the hotel. Temple has tried to phone for help, but the lines are dead. Back on the boat, Curly asks Frank how they're doing, and Frank says they're right on course. Curly goes to the rear of the boat, where Toots is seasick and hanging over the side near the stern. Ralph is there with him, and Curly tells Ralph that Rocco and Angel are below deck sleeping. Curly returns to the wheelhouse and also goes down below.Below deck, there is a radio on and Angel, Rocco and Curly hear a radio report looking for the missing boat. Curly asks Rocco if it was a good idea to leave Gaye behind as she might squeal and get Ziggy in trouble. Rocco says ""Well...?"" as if that were his plan all along. Curly realizes this was the plan and they laugh.Back above deck, Frank checks his gun and then kills the throttle to the boat. He asks Ralph to look over the stern to see if the propeller is fouled with kelp. As Ralph leans over, Frank suddenly guns the throttle and cuts the wheel hard, tossing Ralph overboard. Toots, still seasick, realizes what has happened and reaches for his gun. Frank shoots him. Hearing the gunfire, Rocco, Angel and Curly start getting out of their bunks. Toots returns fire and shoots Frank in the side, but then falls over dead. Frank runs to the stern to retrieve Toots gun, and as he does, Curly comes up from below decks to see what happened, and Frank shoots him as he comes up the stairs. Curly falls down the stairs, and Frank climbs onto the roof of the wheelhouse.Curly stumbles into the cabin and Rocco asks him what's the matter, but Curly falls over dead. Rocco goes for his gun and finally realizes that it is gone, and that Gaye lifted it from his pocket in her farewell scene. Rocco retrieves Curly's gun from his dead hand instead and heads for the stairs. He yells for Toots and Ralph with no answer, then for ""Soldier"". Frank is on the roof of the wheelhouse looking down through the skylight, watching the stairwell. Rocco tells Angel to go upstairs. Angel says ""no, he will kill me"", but Rocco tells him there is nothing to fear, as Toots has killed Frank. Angel tells him if that's the case, then HE should go upstairs. Rocco responds by killing Angel, leaving only him and Frank alive on the boat.Rocco heads for the stairs and appeals to Frank, offering him a 50/50 stake as a partner. Frank answers only with silence. Rocco then says he knows what Frank wants, the whole stake for himself. Rocco then offers him ALL of the money and throws the bag through the stairwell door. Frank still does not respond. Rocco then has another fit of rage and threatens Frank, saying he's ""not big enough to do this to Rocco"" and he will kill him. Frank still does not respond.Rocco then says he knows what it is - Frank doesnt trust him because hes got a gun. So he takes Angel's gun and throws it up the stairs, implying that he is now unarmed. He tells Frank he is coming out now and begins up the stairs. ""I got no gun, I'm coming out"", he says, attempting to conceal his own gun in the process.As soon as Rocco crosses the doorway onto the deck, Frank shoots him from above. Rocco, hit, but not mortally, raises his gun, but Frank shoots him a second time. Rocco tries one more time, but Frank fires a third shot and Rocco collapses onto the deck. Frank comes down from the roof and immediately turns the boat around to return to Florida. He ties the wheel in place to hold his course and goes below deck to radio ashore and call for help. He requests help and asks to be connected to the Largo Hotel.Meanwhile, back at the hotel, Sheriff Wade is there and apparently Gaye has already turned on Ziggy. Sheriff Wade tells them Ziggy and his men were caught heading into Georgia and apologizes to Temple for killing the Osceolas. Gaye tells him it wasnt his fault and that no one is safe as long as Johnny Rocco is alive.As Gaye leaves with Sheriff Wade, the phone rings. Nora answers it and it is Frank. He tells her what has happened. She is relieved and tells her father that he's coming back to them. She opens a window and sunshine finally streams in. The film ends with Frank steering the boat back to his new home.The End.","

    Synopsis
    The film opens with an aerial scene of the Florida Keys in the 1940s. Scrolling text says: At the southernmost point of the United States are the Florida Keys, a string of small islands held together by a concrete causeway. Largest of these remote coral islands is Key Largo.A bus is crossing a bridge and is overtaken by a sheriff's car, which pulls the bus over. Sheriff Ben Wade (Monte Blue) speaks to the driver through the window while Deputy Clyde Sawyer (John Rodney) walks through the bus. Sheriff Wade advises the driver they are looking for a couple of Indians that broke out of jail and describes them as young bucks in fancy shirts. He asks the driver to phone his office if he sees them. After the police leave, the driver turns and tells Major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) seated behind him that the Indians must be from around here, as they always return home. ""Home being Key Largo"", says McCloud.The bus resumes its trip and pulls up at the Largo Hotel. A sign indicates ""Largo Hotel - James Temple, Proprietor"". McCloud departs the bus and walks into the hotel. A man (Harry Lewis) is reading the paper in the lobby, but no one else is around. Frank rings the bell at the front desk. The man reading the paper asks Frank if he wants something and Frank asks for Mr. Temple. The paper-reader tells him he isn't here, the hotel is closed, and he doesnt know when Mr. Temple will be back. Frank wanders into the adjacent bar to find a woman and several men listening to a radio. Frank asks for a beer and is told by the people at the bar, and again by the paper-reader who followed him in, that the hotel is closed in the summer, everything is closed. The woman, however, insists that the man standing behind the bar give Frank a drink, which he reluctantly does.Frank thanks the woman and sits down next to her, where he sees she is clearly intoxicated. She is glued to the radio and listening to a horse race, following along on a racing form. The buzzer behind the bar goes off and a man at the bar says ""that's him"", whereupon the man behind the bar pours a drink and hands it to paper-reader. The woman says she'll bring it up, but the man seated at the bar says ""when he wants you he'll send for you"". The woman engages Frank in speculation about the next race and tells the man behind the bar, who we now know as Angel (Dan Seymour), to give Frank another drink. Frank lights a cigarette as the drunk woman rambles on about her handicapping strategy. She asks Frank his name and he tells her, along with his breeding lineage. She introduces herself as Dawn. Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor). Meanwhile, paper-reader returns from upstairs and tells Gaye ""he wants you"". She excuses herself and stumbles through the lobby, making up her face as she goes.The men at the bar ask who Frank is, and tell him once again that the hotel is closed and wont be open for another month. Frank asks them what they're doing here, and they say they are here by special arrangement. Frank says he is not interested in staying, he just wants to see Mr. Temple. One of the men at the bar tells him hes out at the boathouse. Frank picks up his hat and bag and heads out.Out on the pier behind the hotel he meets James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), who is wheelchair-bound. When Frank introduces himself, Mr. Temple yells for his daughter Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall), who is tying up a small boat at the pier. Mr. Temple introduces Nora as George's wife and Frank tells her that he and her husband were in the same outfit overseas. The three make small talk about life in the Keys and Frank tells them he knows a lot about the Keys from conversations with George. Frank tells them he is just passing through on his way to Key West, but at Mr. Temple's insistence, agrees to stay the night in George's old room.As Nora heads back inside, she passes Sheriff Wade and Deputy Sawyer, who have just arrived. The police ask Mr. Temple if hes seen the Osceola brothers. He tells them no, and introduces Frank as his son's Commanding Officer. Deputy Sawyer tells Mr. Temple they want to look around for the Osceola brothers, and Mr. Temple tells them they are not there and suggests he look for them in the mangroves or in the water, or wait for them to give themselves up. Deputy Sawyer insists, but Sheriff Wade tells him that Mr. Temple's word is good enough for him, and the policemen depart. Mr. Temple tells Frank that the two Indian brothers grew up with his son George and were good people who did nothing more than get drunk and stir up some trouble in Palm Grove. He says that he's sent word for them to give themselves up - ""not that I know where they are, mind you"".Temple and Frank head back inside, where Temple formally introduces paper-reader to Frank as Edward Bass, and the man behind the bar as Angel Garcia. Temple tells the men that Frank was his son's Commanding Officer in the Italian campaign and that George was killed in the Italian campaign.
Suddenly there is a disturbance from upstairs, Gaye screams, and the third man from the bar is seen shoving Gaye into a room. Frank asks why he hit her and he tells Frank shes a lush and that a sock in the kisser is the only thing that will bring her out of it. Nora tells Frank his room is ready and takes him there.Alone with Nora, Frank asks her about the guests, and Nora tells him the one they just saw, Richard ""Curly"" Hoff (Thomas Gomez) and Gaye got there first about a week ago. The Temples told them they were closed, but were offered so much money for a week they could not turn it down. Mr. Brown and the others arrived in a big boat four days ago. Frank asks which one is Brown, and Nora tells him he's in room 11 but only comes out at night, and he must be rich because the others jump at his command. Frank thinks it's odd that they chose to set down in Key Largo in this time of year with the extreme heat. Nora says they'll be leaving in a day or two so she doesnt care.Nora asks Frank if he was with George when he died and Frank tells her yes, but George did not suffer and never knew what hit him. Nora leaves Frank, and Curly stops in to introduce himself and apologizes for the brusque treatment in the bar. He explains they are here on a fishing trip from Milwaukee, a trip they planned for a year, and one guy screwed up the whole trip by bringing a lush woman with him. He says the woman spoiled the whole trip. Frank mostly ignores him coming down the stairs, apparently not happy about his treatment of Gaye in the upstairs hall. Curly offers him a drink, but Frank declines. Meanwhile, Nora takes a call and finds that a hurricane is on its way. She leads Frank to Mr. Temple's room.Temple and Nora ask Frank about George, as all they had was a letter from the War Department. Frank tells the Temples that George was a born-hero and tells them a few stories about George's heroism in Italy. He tells them that George talked incessantly about the Temples, including telling Frank some personal stories about Nora and his father that Frank relates to them. James asks where George is buried and Frank describes it. The Temples express their gratitude to Frank, who takes his leave.With the storm coming, Frank and Nora head out to secure some boats, and Nora asks what brought Frank to the islands. Frank says he is thinking of maybe settling down and making a living there. As they approach the boats, Curly shows up and introduces Frank to another member of their party, Ralph Feeney (William Haade). Frank and Nora secure a boat to the pier. Nora asks where Frank learned about boats and Frank tells her his first sweetheart was a boat. Curly asks Frank what he thinks about a large boat just offshore and Frank tells him its a nice boat, but should be secured away from the reef with the storm coming. Nora watches Frank with admiration as he ties up the Temples' boat. As they finish up, an Indian family arrives in several small boats, including a very old woman (Felipa Gomez). Nora explains that the Indians often stay with them when theres a storm. The last two Indians off the boat are Tom Osceola (Jay Silverheels) and John Osceola (Rodd Redwing) the Indians the sheriff is looking for. The Osceolas tell Nora they are here to give themselves up to the police, if thats what Mr. Temple thinks is right. Nora tells them to go inside and her Dad will call up to Palm Grove.Nora and Frank make small talk about how she met George. Meanwhile, the wind starts to blow and it begins to storm. Nora heads inside to start preparing for the storm as the fishing party mills about in the lobby and bar. Once again Curly tries to get Frank to drink with him. Ralph is obviously concerned about the hurricane, but Curly makes light of it and mocks Ralph.Mr. Temple comes into the lobby escorted by the Osceola brothers. He asks if anyone has seen Sheriff Wade, as his car is outside. Mr. Temple tells the Osceolas that maybe THEY should go looking for the Sheriff instead. Ed Bass, who Curly calls ""Toots"", reads the paper and tells silly jokes from the paper. Mr. Temple asks Frank, who is securing some doors, if he has seen the police, and Curly once again tries to get everyone to have a drink. The Temples and Frank once again decline. As Nora continues to prepare, Curly tells Ralph to go put up the windows in the car, but Ralph, obviously even more concerned, says ""no way"".The phone rings and Curly tells no one to answer it. He answers it himself and tells the caller that Mr. Temple is not here, and neither is Nora. Mr. Temple and Nora approach and Curly tells the caller that if Sawyer shows up he'll have him call right back. Nora tries for the phone, Curly snatches it away, and when Frank moves on Curly, both Curly and Toots pull guns on him.The scene switches to a man in a bathtub (Edward G. Robinson), reading a paper, smoking a cigar and having a drink. He gets out of the tub as Curly enters his room and tells him that the soldier tried to get rough with them, and they had to show him their guns. The man puts on a robe as Curly tells him it was the law on the phone looking for Sawyer. We then see that Sawyer, who has apparently chosen to ignore Sheriff Wade's direction to not snoop around, is in the bather's room, bleeding from the head, and we now realize that the call was apparently Sheriff Wade looking for him.Mr. Temple calls for Brown, the man in the tub, and with the whole gang in the lobby, verbally accosts them and ridicules them. He asks if they are thieves here to rob him, to which Toots replies ""thats right, we're here to steal all your towels"". Brown tells them that he doesnt want any trouble for anyone and asks Temple to act sensible; he'll be gone in a couple hours. He tells Temple that they will be HIS guest for a little while.
Meanwhile, Sawyer begins to come around and walks out of Brown's room into the lobby, to the surprise of Temple and Nora. He says ""you wont get away with this, Rocco"" and is tripped and sent sprawling by Toots. Realization dawns on Frank's face as Temple asks why they hurt Sawyer (""because hes a cop""), and Frank suddenly recognizes Mr. Brown as Johnny Rocco.Frank tells Mr. Temple that Johnny Rocco is a notorious gangster. Temple says they threw Rocco out of the country. Temple then tells Rocco he should have been exterminated not deported, and Frank intervenes on Temple's behalf and flatters Rocco for his success in everything from running numbers to booze, as he built his criminal empire. Rocco, flattered, ignores Temple. Temple, however, continues to verbally assault Rocco as Frank continues to try and shield the Temples from Rocco.Rocco questions Frank about his war service and Frank downplays his role and says he was no hero and that he only did what he had to do in the war. Meanwhile, Rocco and Temple trade verbal assaults. Rocco taunts Temple until he rises from his chair and collapses trying to hit him. Nora tries to attack Rocco, scratching his face, but Rocco pins her arms behind her and kisses her instead. Ralph then arrives and tells Rocco that Miami wants him on the phone. Rocco departs and Frank and Nora help Temple back to his chair.Ralph tells Rocco a bunch of Indians want in from the storm and Rocco tells Ralph not to let them in. Rocco takes the call, from a man named ""Ziggy"". There is a knock on the door and Ralph answers it. It's the skipper of the boat he arrived in (Alberto Morin) and Ralph lets him in, but pushes the waiting Indians back outside. Meanwhile, Rocco is just hearing about the hurricane on the phone, but tells Ziggy ""it's got to be tonight"" and he'd see him in a couple hours.The Skipper tells Rocco that the boat must leave now, the storm is too dangerous. Rocco threatens him with a gun and the Skipper acquiesces and tells him OK.Meanwhile, Sawyer is telling the group that he came back looking for the Osceola boys. He says he ran into Toots and Curly in the lobby, grew suspicious, and put in a call to Sheriff Wade, but the lines went out before the call went through, and the next thing he remembers, he awoke in Rocco's room where he was promptly knocked out again.Rocco re-enters and tells the gang that everything is OK in Miami, and that the folks in Miami are leaving right away. He tells Sawyer that he's surprised that he EVER woke up after the way Toots worked him over. He sits down to have Angel give him a shave as he continues to taunt Sawyer about not being able to take him down. Rocco tells him he was too much for the big city and federal cops, and no hick cop like him will take him down. Rocco tells stories of how he once controlled politicians and cops alike. He rises from his shave, sees Nora in the mirror and tells how he once knew a ""wildcat like her"" named Maggie Mooney, but he had to change her name for professional reasons and that she was now Gaye Dawn. Rocco then approaches Nora and whispers in her ear. Nora is obviously revolted, but Rocco follows her as she walks away and whispers to her again. She turns to confront him and Temple tries to rise from his chair but is restrained by Toots. Rocco spins Nora around to face him and she spits in his face.Frank comes and leads Rocco away as Temple taunts him further. Frank tells Rocco to come on over, he'd like to spit on him too. Rocco, his rage building, tells Curly to give him a gun, which he does. The gang tells Rocco to smack Nora, but Frank tells the gang that spanking isnt good enough for Rocco, he wants to kill her, but if he killed her he'd have to kill all the witnesses too, including the gang. But he needs the gang, so he wont kill anyone just yet. Rocco is upset that Frank sees through him. Curly commends Frank for defusing the situation.Meanwhile, Gaye returns and wants to know what's going on and wants to start drinking again. It appears that she's missed the past several hours as she doesnt know whats going on. She is growing agitated from not having a drink, but Angel tells her the boss said no more. She gets upset and begins to curse Rocco, but just then, he re-enters the room, having dressed. Gaye sees the scratch on his face from Nora, and suddenly realizes what she missed.Rocco confronts Frank and asks him if he has a million dollars. When Frank says no, Rocco asks him why not, he thought he was a wise guy, and Frank says its because he was educated in the practical things, unlike Rocco who was just the opposite. Suddenly the wind blows a window open. Rocco wonders aloud if a car can get through the storm, and Gaye tries once again for a drink.Rocco and Frank continue to feel each other out. Frank tells Rocco that all he wants is more, more, more and that all he wants, himself, is a world where there is no place for the Johnny Roccos. Rocco offers to give him his chance and hands Frank a gun while pulling one of his own. He tells Frank here's his chance to get his wish, but he's got to die for it, as Rocco is aiming at his belly. He taunts Frank to shoot him as Temple tells him to kill him. Rocco taunts and taunts, and Frank is egged on by Sawyer as well. Rocco tells Frank he must not want it enough, and Frank throws the gun down, saying ""one Rocco, more or less, isnt worth dying for.""Temple says to give HIM the gun, and Rocco says no, he's afraid he'd use it and one old man, more or less, isnt worth dying for. Rocco insinuates that Frank is a coward and that's how he survived the war. Suddenly, Sawyer springs to his feet and grabs the gun Frank discarded and levels it at Rocco. He backs toward the door and tells Rocco he can stop him, but HE'S got to die first. He tells Toots and Angel to get out of his way and continues toward the door, holding the gun on Rocco. As Sawyer gets to the door and opens it, Rocco shoots him. Sawyer shoots back, only to find that the gun he has, the one that Rocco gave to Frank, is not loaded. Rocco shoots him again and he falls out of the doorway. Rocco tells Nora that yes, the gun wasn't loaded, but ""our hero didn't know it"". Temple says Frank knew the gun wasn't loaded, Frank said he did not, Toots said Frank was just a coward, but Gaye gets it right and says that Frank was smart, because he knew what happened to Sawyer would have happened to him and ""it's better to be a live coward than a dead hero"".Curly and Angel take Sawyer's body out in a boat to dump it at sea, while Ralph cleans up the mess where Sawyer fell dead. The phone rings and Rocco answers it. It's Ziggy, and Rocco is upset because Ziggy is not there yet. He says he risked his neck to come from Cuba with ""the shipment"" and he knows a dozen guys who will take it if Ziggy isnt there by ten o'clock, two hours from now. The power then goes out in the hotel and Toots herds everyone downstairs at gunpoint. Gaye makes her way to the bar and pours a drink, but Rocco tells her he told her no drinking. Angel and Curly return from disposing of Sawyer and Rocco tells them to go get the shipment.Rocco pours out Gaye's drink and tells the whole crew, now assembled in the bar, how she's an alcoholic and if there's one thing he can't stand its a dame that's a lush. She wasn't like that eight years ago. She tells him he hasn't changed and is still as mean as can be. Rocco says that reminds him of a song she used to sing, and humiliates her about how she could have been a star. He tells her if she sings her old song he will let her have a drink. Gaye tells the group about her days as a singer and starts singing Billie Holiday's song ""Moanin' Low"". She sings very poorly and humiliates herself even further, to the bemusement of Rocco. When she finishes, she runs to the bar for her drink, but Rocco denies her anyway. Frank then goes behind the bar, pours a scotch and gives it to Gaye who slams it down. Rocco slaps Frank three times in the face. Frank ignores Rocco and tells Gaye she's welcome.As Toots and Curly sit down to play gin and wait, the hurricane gets worse and the building starts shaking. Rocco asks Temple ""how bad can it get?"", and Temple tells Rocco of the hurricane of 1935 that had 200mph wind and killed 800 people. Nora apologizes, quietly, to Frank for calling him a coward and he tells her he's not a hero. But she tells him that she knows otherwise, and she knows from George's letters that Frank was really the hero that Frank told her George was.With the storm worsening, Rocco begins to get more and more worried and nervous. The hotel creaks and shakes and Frank smiles as he senses Rocco's fear. Rocco tells Temple he's a liar, that the story of the 1935 hurricane never happened. Temple plays on his fear and tells him how the storm was so strong it blew a train off the tracks. Frank taunts Rocco and asks him why he doesn't just show the storm his gun and threaten to shoot IT. Temple prays for a wave to kill them all. Rocco pulls his gun on Temple, but Frank intervenes as Rocco puts the gun in Frank's belly and pulls the trigger, but Rocco apparently has the unloaded gun now. The tension is broken as a tree comes crashing through a window. The scene switches to outside and we see waves crashing over the island and the Indians huddling on the hotel's porch begging to be let in.Back inside the hotel, some time has passed and the storm is abating. Frank tells Nora pretty soon nothing will be left but some trash on the beach. Nora asks if she'll ever see Frank again, and Temple tells Frank he'd be honored if he came down, as he considers him family. It is then that Toots comes into the lobby yelling for the boss to tell him that the boat is gone. The skipper has apparently taken off without Rocco and the gang, who are now stranded in Key Largo. Rocco says not to worry, there is another boat out there and that Frank will run it for them.The Osceola brothers appear at the door, yelling at Mr. Temple for denying their family shelter from the storm. Rocco had told Temple he sent them away. Temple tells Rocco they could have died out there, but Rocco does not care. He turns to Frank and tells him that he will be taking them to Cuba. Frank says he will not, and Rocco will not kill him because hes the only way off the island. Rocco then threatens him with beating and torture at the hands of Toots.There is a knock on the door and it is Sheriff Wade asking for Temple. Nora answers the door and lets him in. Wade, it turns out, is looking for Sawyer, and Nora tells him they havent seen him. Wade says that's funny, because Sawyer called from there a short time ago. No one in the hotel speaks up and Wade's suspicion grows. Curly suggests that Sawyer must have stopped in, called, then left and is stuck in the storm. Wade then asks if they've seen the Osceolas, who they all deny having seen, as well.Wade leaves the hotel and as he gets back in his car and turns on the lights, he sees Sawyer's body, which the storm has carried back ashore. He investigates and sees that Sawyer has been shot several times. As he heads back for the hotel, he speaks to Rocco, who the Sheriff thinks is ""Mr. Brown"". Rocco tells him he didn't want to rat out the Temples, but the Indians were there during the storm, had just left. He insinuates the Osceolas killed Sawyer. Sheriff Wade runs toward the pier and encounters the Indians. He finds the Osceolas, who take off running. Wade shoots both of them dead.Rocco comes back into the hotel and is followed, after a few minutes, by Sheriff Wade, who tells them that their Indian friends killed Sawyer. He tells Temple he will hold him accountable as an accessory to the murder. Wade then tells Temple he killed the Osceola brothers. Wade begins to take a report and questions Rocco and his gang. He also questions Frank, whose anger is beginning to visibly show.As Wade questions the hotel group, Ziggy and his gang finally arrive, pretending to be tourists, and Sheriff Wade takes his leave. Toots herds Frank and the Temples into another room as Rocco and Ziggy exchange pleasantries and laughs. Curly retrieves the package for Ziggy and opens it up to reveal a large pile of money. Ziggy examines it, and it's clear it is counterfeit money that Rocco has had printed for Ziggy. Satisfied with the product, Ziggy pays Rocco with a bag of (presumably) real money.While the transaction is going down, in the other room, Gaye and Nora implore Frank to not go with Rocco as Rocco will kill him. They urge him to make a break for it in the dark. Frank tells them that his head tells him to do that, but his heart tells him otherwise.The transaction concluded, Ziggy and his gang take their leave. Rocco tells Ralph to bring everything down, including the soldier's gear. He asks Frank one last time if he will take them, and tells Toots to work him over. Frank relents and says he will come along. Rocco asks Nora if she wants to come too, but she ignores him, and stares at Frank. Rocco puts on his coat and slips a gun into the pocket. Gaye asks where her things are, and Rocco tells her she isnt going back with him, gives her some money and tells her ""that ought to be enough to stay drunk for a good long time"".Gaye lunges for Rocco, hangs all over him, and begs him to take her with him. She promises to stop drinking and threatens to commit suicide if he leaves her. She claws at him repeatedly, but he finally pushes her away where she runs into Frank and we see she has taken the gun from Rocco's pocket. She slips it to Frank, who hides it in his hat. The gang depart and head for the Temples' boat. Nora and Gaye watch to see if Frank makes a break for it, but he does not and gets on the boat with the gang.Frank takes command of the boat and they depart the dock as Nora and Gaye return to the hotel. Temple has tried to phone for help, but the lines are dead. Back on the boat, Curly asks Frank how they're doing, and Frank says they're right on course. Curly goes to the rear of the boat, where Toots is seasick and hanging over the side near the stern. Ralph is there with him, and Curly tells Ralph that Rocco and Angel are below deck sleeping. Curly returns to the wheelhouse and also goes down below.Below deck, there is a radio on and Angel, Rocco and Curly hear a radio report looking for the missing boat. Curly asks Rocco if it was a good idea to leave Gaye behind as she might squeal and get Ziggy in trouble. Rocco says ""Well...?"" as if that were his plan all along. Curly realizes this was the plan and they laugh.Back above deck, Frank checks his gun and then kills the throttle to the boat. He asks Ralph to look over the stern to see if the propeller is fouled with kelp. As Ralph leans over, Frank suddenly guns the throttle and cuts the wheel hard, tossing Ralph overboard. Toots, still seasick, realizes what has happened and reaches for his gun. Frank shoots him. Hearing the gunfire, Rocco, Angel and Curly start getting out of their bunks. Toots returns fire and shoots Frank in the side, but then falls over dead. Frank runs to the stern to retrieve Toots gun, and as he does, Curly comes up from below decks to see what happened, and Frank shoots him as he comes up the stairs. Curly falls down the stairs, and Frank climbs onto the roof of the wheelhouse.Curly stumbles into the cabin and Rocco asks him what's the matter, but Curly falls over dead. Rocco goes for his gun and finally realizes that it is gone, and that Gaye lifted it from his pocket in her farewell scene. Rocco retrieves Curly's gun from his dead hand instead and heads for the stairs. He yells for Toots and Ralph with no answer, then for ""Soldier"". Frank is on the roof of the wheelhouse looking down through the skylight, watching the stairwell. Rocco tells Angel to go upstairs. Angel says ""no, he will kill me"", but Rocco tells him there is nothing to fear, as Toots has killed Frank. Angel tells him if that's the case, then HE should go upstairs. Rocco responds by killing Angel, leaving only him and Frank alive on the boat.Rocco heads for the stairs and appeals to Frank, offering him a 50/50 stake as a partner. Frank answers only with silence. Rocco then says he knows what Frank wants, the whole stake for himself. Rocco then offers him ALL of the money and throws the bag through the stairwell door. Frank still does not respond. Rocco then has another fit of rage and threatens Frank, saying he's ""not big enough to do this to Rocco"" and he will kill him. Frank still does not respond.Rocco then says he knows what it is - Frank doesnt trust him because hes got a gun. So he takes Angel's gun and throws it up the stairs, implying that he is now unarmed. He tells Frank he is coming out now and begins up the stairs. ""I got no gun, I'm coming out"", he says, attempting to conceal his own gun in the process.As soon as Rocco crosses the doorway onto the deck, Frank shoots him from above. Rocco, hit, but not mortally, raises his gun, but Frank shoots him a second time. Rocco tries one more time, but Frank fires a third shot and Rocco collapses onto the deck. Frank comes down from the roof and immediately turns the boat around to return to Florida. He ties the wheel in place to hold his course and goes below deck to radio ashore and call for help. He requests help and asks to be connected to the Largo Hotel.Meanwhile, back at the hotel, Sheriff Wade is there and apparently Gaye has already turned on Ziggy. Sheriff Wade tells them Ziggy and his men were caught heading into Georgia and apologizes to Temple for killing the Osceolas. Gaye tells him it wasnt his fault and that no one is safe as long as Johnny Rocco is alive.As Gaye leaves with Sheriff Wade, the phone rings. Nora answers it and it is Frank. He tells her what has happened. She is relieved and tells her father that he's coming back to them. She opens a window and sunshine finally streams in. The film ends with Frank steering the boat back to his new home.The End.

                    Wealthy Michael and Elvira Kent, who are celebrating their third wedding anniversary, have never trusted the faithfulness of the other. For Elvira, that suspicion stems in large part from Michael always baling at the last minute from taking an anniversary trip as he always seems to be called off on a business trip for the pharmacy conglomerate where he works which is owned by Elvira's Uncle Lazlo. So when Michael bales again on their planned third wedding anniversary trip - a round trip cruise between New York and Rio de Janeiro - Elvira decides to test Michael's faithfulness by pretending to go on the trip. In reality, Elvira is staying in New York, she who hires a private investigator to spy on Michael. Further, Elvira hires Georgia Garrett, a rough-around-the-edges penniless honky-tonk singer who she meets at the travel agency, to take the all expenses paid trip in her place. Georgia will pretend to be Elvira in every aspect, including maintaining a proper image which means no improper fraternizing with men on board. Michael, in turn, believes Elvira is meeting her lover on board, and as such hires his own private investigator, Peter Virgil, to shadow Elvira on the cruise. Complications ensue when Peter falls in love with who he believes is Elvira but is really Georgia, while Georgia falls in love with Peter, with who she can't have a relationship since she is supposed to be married Mrs. Elvira Kent. A second level of complications arise when Georgia's wannabe boyfriend, pianist Oscar Farrar, follows Georgia on board. And a third level of complications arise when Elvira and Michael individually decide to be in Rio when the ship docks to find out first hand what's going on. Uncle Lazlo seems to be around for all the proceedings and seems to know everything that is transpiring, but he just doesn't know what secrets to keep and which to divulge.

                    William Shakespeare's tale of tragedy of murder and revenge in the royal halls of medieval Denmark. Claudius, brother to the King, conniving with the Queen, poisons the monarch and seizes the throne, taking the widowed Gertrude for his bride. Hamlet, son of the murdered King, mournful of his father's death and mother's hasty marriage, is confronted by the ghost of the late King who reveals the manner of his murder. Seeking revenge, Hamlet recreates the monstrous deed in a play with the help of some traveling actors to torment the conscience of the evil Claudius. In a visit with his mother, Hamlet expresses his anger and disappointment concerning her swiftly untimed marriage. Thinking a concealed spy in his mother's chamber to be the lurking Claudius, he mistakenly kills the meddling counselor, Polonius, father of Ophelia and Laertes. Claudius, on the pretext that Hamlet will be endangered by his subjects for the murder of Polonius, sends the prince to England.

Thinking that her husband Henry would be home, she gave her nurse and the servants the night off. But Henry never came home from work and Leona is frantically trying to locate him. His office number is busy. In desperation, Leona telephones her husband's secretary, Miss Jennings, at home. She learns that Henry left the office with a Mrs. Lord and did not return.In flashbacks, it is revealed that Leona is the spoiled only child of J.B. Cotterell, the owner of a pharmaceutical company based in Chicago. Her mother died in childbirth and Leona grew up believing that she had a heart ailment. In college she met Henry Stevenson, who came from a dirt-poor background. Although he is dating her best friend Sally, Leona makes a play for him and succeeds in taking him away from Sally.Against the wishes of her father, Leona marries Henry and he goes to work for her father. But he is unsuccessful in persuading Leona that they need a home of their own instead of living with Mr. Cotterell. Leona has a fainting spell and requires a nurse to take care of her. This has happened many times over the years and Mr. Cotterell blames Henry for this latest episode. Henry tries to find other employment but Mr. Cotterell has put the word out not to hire him.Returning to the present time, Leona takes a call from a Mr. Waldo Evans. He has called several times wanting to speak to Henry but won't say what he wants. In telephoning Henry's office again, Leona is accidentally connected to a conversation in which two men are talking. They cannot hear her but she hears them plotting a murder. A woman is to be killed in her home at 11:15 that night. An overheard train will cross the tracks and the cop on patrol always takes a break at that time. No one else will be in the house and their client has arranged to leave a downstairs window unlocked. Their client wants them to make it look like a robbery and he doesn't want the woman to suffer.Leona is horrified and calls the operator, demanding that the call be traced. But the operator doesn't understand what she means about being cut in on a conversation and refers her to the police. The officer who takes Leona's call doesn't believe her. In frustration, Leona hangs up but continues to worry about the unfortunate woman who is set to die.In looking through the telephone messages that came in earlier that day, Leona finds one from the mysterious Mrs. Lord. She telephones the woman and demands to know what is going on with her and Henry. To her surprise, Mrs. Lord turns out to be her old friend Sally. By now Leona is thoroughly bewildered. Sally explains in a low voice that her husband works for the District Attorney and that Henry is in trouble. She came to his office to warn him. Then she hangs up abruptly after telling Leona that she will call back when she can speak privately, as her husband is home.Leona cannot imagine what sort of trouble Henry could be in. She telephones her father in Chicago but he is having a party and doesn't give her a chance to explain why she is calling. He is surprised and angry that she is in the house alone and promises to have a talk with Henry.The phone rings again and it is Western Union with a telegram from Henry. He is enroute to a pharmaceutical convention and will telephone her later. Then Sally calls from a pay phone, having told her husband that she was going out for beer. She doesn't know exactly what trouble Henry is in, only that it is very serious. Earlier that week she followed her husband and one of his colleagues to a deserted house on Staten Island. It appeared to be a drop-off point and Sally heard Henry's name mentioned. Sally is forced to hang up because the drugstore is closing, leaving Leona frustrated and upset.Mr. Evans calls again and this time Leona demands to know why he keeps bothering her. She is a bedridden invalid and cannot take this kind of stress. Mr. Evans reveals that he knows all about her, having been a Cotterell employee for many years. He is in charge of a laboratory; first in Chicago and now in New Jersey. One night when he was working late, Henry stopped by. He looked around the laboratory and asked where the narcotics were kept. Mr. Evans showed him but felt uneasy about it, even though Henry was the boss's son-in-law. Later Henry offered Mr. Evans a ride home as it was raining and his bus was late. During the ride, Mr. Evans shared his desire to retire and return to England. He would like to purchase a horse farm but doubts he will be able to afford it. Henry agrees and offers to cut Mr. Evans in on a deal. If he will hold back some of the narcotics, Henry has a purchaser. They will each receive a large cut, which will go a long way toward purchasing the horse farm. Mr. Evans is horrified and refuses, but greed overtakes him and eventually he agrees.All goes well until Mr. Evans receives a sudden transfer to the New Jersey plant. Henry assures him that it is routine, as he would have been arrested if they were found out. Mr. Evans declares that he wants out but Henry won't allow it. He has already decided to act on his own instead of going through their purchaser, a Mr. Morano. Their share of the money will be a lot more. Henry and Leona move to New York, where Mr. Evans purchased the deserted house on Staten Island. He takes the drugs there and someone in a boat picks them up.Unfortuately, Mr. Morano traces them there and is waiting in the house when Mr. Evans arrives. He wants $150,000 as compensation for the business they took away from him. If they don't pay, they will be killed. When Henry protests that he doesn't have that kind of money, Mr. Morano reminds him that he has a rich wife. An accident can be arranged and he would inherit her money. Henry is sickened but realizes he has no choice. Mr. Evans closes the conversation by giving Leona a message for Henry. The game is up as the police have arrested Mr. Morano. Mr. Evans has burned down the Staten Island house. After midnight he can be reached at a certain number, which Leona writes down. It turns out to be number of the city morgue. Mr. Evans obviously intends to commit suicide rather than be arrested.Leona telephones her father again but there is no answer. She begins to realize that the phone conversation she overheard was about her. She is the woman who is to be killed that night. Believing that her heart is about to give out, she telephones her doctor and begs him to come over. He can't, although he tells her that the results of a recent examination were very good. She does not have heart trouble at all. The doctor sent her a letter with this information but Leona never got it.She calls a nurse's registry but they don't have anyone they can sent over at a moment's notice. Hysterically, Leona tries to get out of bed but she can't make her legs move. Then Henry telephones from the train station in Connecticut and Leona tells him she knows everything. She asks why he didn't come to her for the money, that she would gladly have given it to him because she loves him so much. Then she hears a noise downstairs and screams at Henry that someone is in the house. He orders her to get out of bed and yell out the window for help. But Leona is paralyzed by terror. He admits to having arranged her murder and tells her unless she does as he says, he will burn. The two plainclothes detectives who have been following Henry close in on the phone booth. Then Henry hears Leona's dying scream as she is stabbed. The killer picks up the phone, says ""Sorry wrong number"" and hangs up.","

He has called several times wanting to speak to Henry but won't say what he wants. In telephoning Henry's office again, Leona is accidentally connected to a conversation in which two men are talking. They cannot hear her but she hears them plotting a murder. A woman is to be killed in her home at 11:15 that night. An overheard train will cross the tracks and the cop on patrol always takes a break at that time. No one else will be in the house and their client has arranged to leave a downstairs window unlocked. Their client wants them to make it look like a robbery and he doesn't want the woman to suffer.Leona is horrified and calls the operator, demanding that the call be traced. But the operator doesn't understand what she means about being cut in on a conversation and refers her to the police. The officer who takes Leona's call doesn't believe her. In frustration, Leona hangs up but continues to worry about the unfortunate woman who is set to die.In looking through the telephone messages that came in earlier that day, Leona finds one from the mysterious Mrs. Lord. She telephones the woman and demands to know what is going on with her and Henry. To her surprise, Mrs. Lord turns out to be her old friend Sally. By now Leona is thoroughly bewildered. Sally explains in a low voice that her husband works for the District Attorney and that Henry is in trouble. She came to his office to warn him. Then she hangs up abruptly after telling Leona that she will call back when she can speak privately, as her husband is home.Leona cannot imagine what sort of trouble Henry could be in. She telephones her father in Chicago but he is having a party and doesn't give her a chance to explain why she is calling. He is surprised and angry that she is in the house alone and promises to have a talk with Henry.The phone rings again and it is Western Union with a telegram from Henry. He is enroute to a pharmaceutical convention and will telephone her later. Then Sally calls from a pay phone, having told her husband that she was going out for beer. She doesn't know exactly what trouble Henry is in, only that it is very serious. Earlier that week she followed her husband and one of his colleagues to a deserted house on Staten Island. It appeared to be a drop-off point and Sally heard Henry's name mentioned. Sally is forced to hang up because the drugstore is closing, leaving Leona frustrated and upset.Mr. Evans calls again and this time Leona demands to know why he keeps bothering her. She is a bedridden invalid and cannot take this kind of stress. Mr. Evans reveals that he knows all about her, having been a Cotterell employee for many years. He is in charge of a laboratory; first in Chicago and now in New Jersey. One night when he was working late, Henry stopped by. He looked around the laboratory and asked where the narcotics were kept. Mr. Evans showed him but felt uneasy about it, even though Henry was the boss's son-in-law. Later Henry offered Mr. Evans a ride home as it was raining and his bus was late. During the ride, Mr. Evans shared his desire to retire and return to England. He would like to purchase a horse farm but doubts he will be able to afford it. Henry agrees and offers to cut Mr. Evans in on a deal. If he will hold back some of the narcotics, Henry has a purchaser. They will each receive a large cut, which will go a long way toward purchasing the horse farm. Mr. Evans is horrified and refuses, but greed overtakes him and eventually he agrees.All goes well until Mr. Evans receives a sudden transfer to the New Jersey plant. Henry assures him that it is routine, as he would have been arrested if they were found out. Mr. Evans declares that he wants out but Henry won't allow it. He has already decided to act on his own instead of going through their purchaser, a Mr. Morano. Their share of the money will be a lot more. Henry and Leona move to New York, where Mr. Evans purchased the deserted house on Staten Island. He takes the drugs there and someone in a boat picks them up.Unfortuately, Mr. Morano traces them there and is waiting in the house when Mr. Evans arrives. He wants $150,000 as compensation for the business they took away from him. If they don't pay, they will be killed. When Henry protests that he doesn't have that kind of money, Mr. Morano reminds him that he has a rich wife. An accident can be arranged and he would inherit her money. Henry is sickened but realizes he has no choice. Mr. Evans closes the conversation by giving Leona a message for Henry. The game is up as the police have arrested Mr. Morano. Mr. Evans has burned down the Staten Island house. After midnight he can be reached at a certain number, which Leona writes down. It turns out to be number of the city morgue. Mr. Evans obviously intends to commit suicide rather than be arrested.Leona telephones her father again but there is no answer. She begins to realize that the phone conversation she overheard was about her. She is the woman who is to be killed that night. Believing that her heart is about to give out, she telephones her doctor and begs him to come over. He can't, although he tells her that the results of a recent examination were very good. She does not have heart trouble at all. The doctor sent her a letter with this information but Leona never got it.She calls a nurse's registry but they don't have anyone they can sent over at a moment's notice. Hysterically, Leona tries to get out of bed but she can't make her legs move. Then Henry telephones from the train station in Connecticut and Leona tells him she knows everything. She asks why he didn't come to her for the money, that she would gladly have given it to him because she loves him so much. Then she hears a noise downstairs and screams at Henry that someone is in the house. He orders her to get out of bed and yell out the window for help. But Leona is paralyzed by terror. He admits to having arranged her murder and tells her unless she does as he says, he will burn. The two plainclothes detectives who have been following Henry close in on the phone booth. Then Henry hears Leona's dying scream as she is stabbed. The killer picks up the phone, says ""Sorry wrong number"" and hangs up.

                    A US congressional committee is in Berlin following World War II to investigate rumors of low morale amongst the American troops patrolling the American quadrant of the city. One of those on the committee is Congresswoman Phoebe Frost, a Republican from Iowa who has a singular focus on work, especially when on a mission. Once in Berlin, she believes the committee's military liaison, Colonel Rufus J. Plummer, is providing them with a false report of the issue as she herself has witnessed firsthand what she considers the depravity occurring in the city, especially between American troops and German ""fraulein"". Specifically, she is concerned about an unofficial report of Erika von Schlütow, a singer at an underground cabaret, who was a high ranking Nazi during the war and whose record is being protected and expunged by a high ranking but unknown American military man. To find out who this military man is, Phoebe enlists the help of Captain John Pringle, a fellow Iowan who she met on her travels in Berlin and who she trusts because of his Iowa heritage. She is however unaware that John is Erika's lover and protector. John does whatever he needs to to keep this secret from Phoebe for the few days she's in town. His measures include pretending to have a romantic interest in her himself. Phoebe comes to her own incorrect conclusion of who is protecting Erika. Erika, on the other hand, has her own agenda which she demonstrates in an encounter with Phoebe. Meanwhile, John's secret from Phoebe may become compromised when Colonel Plummer, aware of John and Erika's relationship, asks John to perform a military task concerning hunting down Hans Otto Birgel, a missing member of the Gestapo who was a former companion of Erika's.

It's clear this violence-prone young man also has tuberculosis. The doctor and gangster form a quicksilver bond that partly involves the older medical man keeping the young tough alive and well; but it is also marked by shouting, shoving, throwing punches and throwing nearby objects at each other. Meanwhile, the old gang boss is back out of prison. He's eager to have his old turf back and eager to reestablish ties with his wife, whom he infected with venereal disease and who now works as an assistant to the doctor.

                    Lawyer Joe Morse wants to consolidate all the small-time numbers racket operators into one big powerful operation. But his elder brother Leo is one of these small-time operators who wants to stay that way, preferring not to deal with the gangsters who dominate the big-time.

                    It's one thing for a lawyer to defend a client in the numbers racket, but it's another for him to become partners with the man. Joe Morse crosses that ethical line with his gangster client, Ben Tucker. Together they've got a scheme to shut down all the illegal banks in the city, and buy up the ones they want. Joe has an older brother, Leo, a man with heart trouble; and Leo has one of these illegal banks. Joe wants to do something good for Leo, to force his brother out of his penny-ante racket and come work for the big boys. The trouble is, Leo is happy with his small, if not quite ethical, business. His employees are like family to him. His secretary, Doris Lowry, is like a daughter. He wants nothing to do with his little brother's scheme and nothing to do with gangsters. But Joe won't give him a choice. Joe has a strong will - strong enough to make the sweet and innocent Doris fall in love with him. But he's still too weak to turn straight and save himself, and everyone connected to him, from disaster.

                    Dr. Robert Richardson, a dedicated young general practitioner, seeks to establish himself in an isolated fishing village on Cape Breton Island off the Nova Scotia coast. The population is poor and the struggling physician generally gets paid for his efforts in barter. When he meets Belinda McDonald, a young deaf mute callously dismissed by family and neighbors as ""the dummy,"" he alone senses her innate intelligence. He overcomes the initial skepticism of her flinty, gruff father and indifferently cold aunt, who operate a hardscrabble grist mill and farm, and devotes himself to teaching the young girl sign language and lip-reading. Hopes are even raised that she might even eventually qualify for a medical procedure that might improve her condition. Her optimism is crushed, however, when she raped by Locky McCormick, a brutish local fisherman. Traumatized, she is unable to communicate the outrage to her family, who are baffled and angry when they learn she is pregnant. The local gossips blame the doctor, and he and the McDonalds become pariahs, unable to earn a living in the provincial village. Matters come to a head when McCormick and his new wife pressure the local council to declare Belinda an unfit mother and declare them the baby's legal guardians.

It isn't until the police bring in sympathetic child psychologist Dr. Evans that the boy decides to tell his story, including the reason for his shaved head. His name is Peter Fry, who currently lives with a relative he calls Gramp, despite Gramp not being Peter's true grandfather. Prior to Gramp, Peter was shuttled between several other relatives while Peter's parents were away. Since his life with his parents, it wasn't until he started living with Gramp, a retired performer who now works as a singing waiter, that Peter felt like a normal boy in a loving and stable home. This supportive life also includes several friends at school, under the sympathetic wing of their teacher, Miss Brand. It wasn't until Miss Brand organized a clothing drive for war orphans that Peter found out that that his own parents were killed in the war, meaning that he too is a war orphan, hence the true reason for living with relatives. This newfound status made Peter start to think about the war, the plight of war orphans, and the sanctity of life. Peter woke up one morning to find that his normally brown hair had turned to green. Although Peter and all those around him had various reactions to his green hair, he eventually came to a belief of what the green hair meant, and the important mission associated with it. But the action of others, who were less certain as to why Peter's hair turned green, led to where Peter is today. With Dr. Evans and Gramp's help among others, Peter may come back to truly appreciating who he is and his special place in the world.

    Synopsis
    A boy who has lost his parents during WWII while they were trying to help children in London wakes up to find his hair has turned green. As he tries to understand why his hair has turned green, the people his community ostracize him and want him to cut his hair off or dye it. Far from a comedy, this is heavy moral pondering inspired by the horrors and aftermath of war. The boy finds intolerance in post-war America, condemns it and spreads the message that all war must end.

It takes an awful lot of rehearsal for a man to get to be himself.""In the last shot, Nick is cleaning up and decides to take down the sign that says COME IN AS YOU ARE.","

Having no one to contain him, as Nick is out, Blick takes over the joint and demands that Kitty sing and dance to prove she is an actress, as he yells at her he knows her real name is Katerina Koronovsky, and violently pushes around everyone who gets in his way, particularly Kit Carson, who is ejected.Joe returns, and a physical fight ensues. The fight ends as Kit reenters with his gun and shoots at Blick, who falls.In the end, no one gets in trouble. Kitty, apparently a former hooker trying to put the past behind her, gets together with Tom.Along the way, in between quick entrances and exits of the drunkard, Krupp the cop (Broderick Crawford), two ladies of the night, and Krupps buddy McCarthy (Ward Bond), we hear some principles of living, like Joe saying ""Living is an art, it's not bookkeeping. It takes an awful lot of rehearsal for a man to get to be himself.""In the last shot, Nick is cleaning up and decides to take down the sign that says COME IN AS YOU ARE.

A large fishbowl that once contained numerous small fish has been becoming increasingly emptier, and reports of Betty finding seaweed in Miranda's bathtub (not to mention finding the girl has no panties at all!), leads Clare to suspect that Miranda is a mermaid.The whole mess comes to a climax when Charles and Nigel come to see Miranda, both intending to propose marriage to her. It is then they each reveal that Miranda gave them a lock of her hair, and now feel foolish for having been 'played along' by her. Both men then leave to reconcile with the women they have spurned.Paul arrives soon after with Miranda, which Clare soon gets to admit is a mermaid. After finding that Charles and Nigel returned the locks of hair she gave them, Miranda admits to Clare that she intends to leave soon, intending to swim to warmer climates for the month of May. Miranda goes to her room, claiming to get ready to bathe, and willing to allow Clare to see her tail. However, 5-7 minutes later, Clare and Paul find her room empty, and notice Miranda outside, wheeling her chair to the nearby river. Giving chase, they watch as she dives in, and begins to swim towards the sea.As Paul wonders why Miranda would choose to go to warmer climates in the month of May, we cut to an image sometime later of Miranda, sitting on a rock holding a little mer-baby (as to who the father of the child is, it is never revealed).

Igor is not to tell anyone what he does for a living, he given a cover story which he is to recite even when questioned by his own people. He and his wife Anna Gouzenko are supposed to be cordial to their Canadian neighbors and associates, but not fraternize or befriend them, as they are still considered the enemy, despite both countries being on the same side in the war. Igor follows his instructions to a T, but it is more difficult for Anna, who does not have the distraction of work during the day, and who can see that their neighbors are not their enemies but good people much like themselves. Over the next few years, Igor sees that what is happening around him and the work in which he is involved will not result in a world in which he wants to raise his newborn son, Andrezj. As such, the Gouzenkos decide not to return to the Soviet Union. Besides defecting, Igor wants to expose what he is privy to, namely that there is a secret Soviet spy ring operating in Canada, which is comprised of people in authority, such as Canadian military personnel and elected officials.

On the eve of World War 2 in 1939, Dr. Revic (Charles Boyer) is living as a German refugee physician practicing in Paris without permit. Revic is haunted by the memory of the torture doled out on him by Nazi Officer Haake (Charles Laughton) and believes he sees the man on the night streets of Paris. One night as he is walking Revic meets a young suicidal woman Joan Madou (Ingrid Bergman), upset because he lover has suddenly died. Ravic gets Joan a job singing in a night club where his best friend Morosow (Louis Calhern) is the door man. Joan falls in love with Revic but the good doctor is deported and Joan becomes the mistress of Alex (Stephan Bekassy) an occupation that leads to her dissipation. When Revic returns Joan tries to reconnect with him but the spell has been broken and Revic is too much of a realist, a manner tempered by his exposure to war and his duties as a doctor. As the Germans march into Paris Joan and Alex clash in a life-altering lovers argument, Morosow is taken from his apartment and arrested, and Revic faces deportation again with severe life lessons.

                    At an American air base in England, 1943, is conniving Sergeant Dolan, who manipulates everyone, and insubordinate ace fighter pilot Major Ed Hardin. When Ed is promoted to commander of his group, he must fight his former anti-authority stance as well as the enemy; tension grows as D-Day approaches. Generally lighthearted between moments of technicolor gore; lots of air combat footage, much of it genuine.

When he is made the unit's commanding officer, he finds himself in constant conflict with his immediate superior Brig. Gen. Mel Gilbert. Meanwhile, the unit's Master Sergeant, James Dolan, is a wheeler- dealer and something of a ladies man whose exploits are now known far and wide.

English actor Robert Donat was a heartthrob of the period: he portrays barrister (English version of our litigator or trial lawyer) Sir Robert Morton, an expensive, what-we'd-call corporate attorney; after several false starts, including a debate in the House of Commons (over what in English law was basically a lawsuit against the Crown), Sir Robert accepts the case.The centerpiece here is Sir Robert's interrogation of young Ronnie, the defendant, in the boy's home, in front of his rapidly deteriorating father & antagonistic, suffragette sister. Sir Robert's battery of questions quickly turns into an 18-K cross-examination, the kind he knows the boy can expect in court, over vehement objections from his family. Meanwhile, the case & the Winslow family become objects of public ridicule & derision.Also interesting are the ways family members change: in the beginning, Pop Winslow (played with Cedric Hardwicke's usual aplomb) seems the most value-rigid & proper fish in a sea of rebels (Lindy Hops, cigarettes); gradually, it's pop who must convince even feminist daugther Katy to stay the course.","

    Synopsis
    Until I saw this recently on TCM, I'd never heard of it: the youngest of a staid Edwardian England family is expelled from a Royal Navy prep school for stealing; father goes to extraordinary lengths to clear his son's name. English actor Robert Donat was a heartthrob of the period: he portrays barrister (English version of our litigator or trial lawyer) Sir Robert Morton, an expensive, what-we'd-call corporate attorney; after several false starts, including a debate in the House of Commons (over what in English law was basically a lawsuit against the Crown), Sir Robert accepts the case.The centerpiece here is Sir Robert's interrogation of young Ronnie, the defendant, in the boy's home, in front of his rapidly deteriorating father & antagonistic, suffragette sister. Sir Robert's battery of questions quickly turns into an 18-K cross-examination, the kind he knows the boy can expect in court, over vehement objections from his family. Meanwhile, the case & the Winslow family become objects of public ridicule & derision.Also interesting are the ways family members change: in the beginning, Pop Winslow (played with Cedric Hardwicke's usual aplomb) seems the most value-rigid & proper fish in a sea of rebels (Lindy Hops, cigarettes); gradually, it's pop who must convince even feminist daugther Katy to stay the course.

                    Oliver Pease gets a dose of courage from his wife Martha and tricks the editor of the paper (where he writes lost pet notices) into assigning him the day's roving question. Martha suggests, ""Has a little child ever changed your life?"" Oliver gets answers from two slow-talking musicians, an actress whose roles usually feature a sarong, and an itinerant cardsharp. In each case the ""little child"" is hardly innocent: in the first, a local auto mechanic's ""baby"" turns out to be fully developed as a woman and a musician; in the second, a spoiled child star learns kindness; in the third, the family of a lost brat doesn't want him returned. And Oliver, what becomes of him?
