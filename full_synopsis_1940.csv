Upon hearing a fatigued pilot pleading for help, the Barber attempts to rescue the exhausted officer, Commander Schultz. The two board Schultz's nearby airplane and fly off, barely escaping enemy ground fire. Schultz reveals that he is carrying important dispatches that could win the war. However, the plane loses fuel and crashes in a marsh. They both survive, but the Barber suffers from memory loss. As medics arrive, Commander Schultz gives them the dispatches, but is told that the war has just ended and Tomainia lost.Years later, as the Barber is released from the hospital, Adenoid Hynkel (also played by Chaplin), the ruthless dictator of Tomainia, has undertaken to persecute Jews throughout his country, aided by Secretary of the Interior and Minister of Propaganda Garbitsch and Minister of War Herring. The symbol of Hynkel's fascist regime is the ""double cross"", and at times, when he's excited or angry, Hynkel speaks in a macaronic parody of the German language. During his first speech, his Tomainian is ""translated"" by an overly concise English-speaking news voice-over.The Barber, unaware of Hynkel's rise to power, returns to his barbershop in the Jewish ghetto. When he opposes the painting of the word ""Jew"" on his barber shop by storm troopers, he flees from them, aided in part by his neighbor, Hannah, who knocks some of them unconscious with a frying pan. The Barber is nearly lynched by a gang of storm troopers, but Schultz, now a high-ranking officer in Hynkel's regime, intervenes. Though surprised to see the man who saved his life at the end of the war is not an Aryan, as he previously imagined, he returns the favor by ordering the storm troopers to take no action against him or Hannah, even when she throws an object at a storm trooper's head.Hynkel relaxes his stance on Tomainian Jewry in an attempt to woo a Jewish financier into giving him a loan to support his regime. Egged on by Garbitsch, Hynkel has become obsessed with the idea of being Dictator of the World, dancing at one point with a large, inflatable globe, to the tune of the Prelude to Act I of Richard Wagner's Lohengrin.Hynkel plans to invade the neighboring country of Osterlich (Austria), and needs the loan to finance the invasion. When the Jewish financier refuses due to the persecution of the Jews, Hynkel reinstates and intensifies his persecution of the Jews contrary to Garbitsch's advice. When Schultz, who is empathetic to the Jews, voices his objection to the pogrom, Hynkel denounces Schultz as a supporter of democracy and a traitor, and orders him placed in a concentration camp. The Barber evades storm troopers who have heard of the arrest by hiding on his neighbor Mr. Jaeckel's roof with Hannah, however his shop is burnt down. Schultz flees to the ghetto and begins planning to overthrow the Hynkel regime with Hannah, the Barber and other residents there. Schultz proposes a suicide mission to blow up the palace, the agent will be chosen by a coin in a pudding. However Hannah causes this to be abandoned by placing coins in all the puddings. Later the Ghetto is searched for Schultz. He and the Barber, hiding on the roof, are captured and condemned to the camp.Hynkel is initially opposed by Benzino Napaloni, dictator of Bacteria, in his plans to invade Osterlich, and even plans to declare war. However just after he signs a declaration of war he receives a call from Napaloni. He invites him and his wife to his palace and a seeing of a military show to impress him with a display of military might and psychological warfare, but this ends in disaster. After some friction, a comedic food fight between the two leaders, and a deal between the two leaders on which Hynkel immediately reneges, his invasion proceeds. Hannah and others from the Ghetto had emigrated to Osterlich to escape Hynkel, but once again they find themselves living under Hynkel's regime.Schultz and the Barber escape from the camp wearing Tomainian uniforms. Border guards mistake the Barber for Hynkel, to whom he is nearly identical in appearance. Conversely, Hynkel, on a duck-hunting trip, falls overboard and is mistaken for the Barber and arrested by his own soldiers. The Barber, now forced by circumstance to assume Hynkel's identity, is taken to the capital of Osterlich to make a victory speech. Garbitsch, in introducing ""Hynkel"" to the throngs, decries free speech and argues for the subjugation of the Jews. The barber then makes a rousing speech, reversing Hynkel's antisemitic policies and declaring that Tomainia and Osterlich will now be a free nation and a democracy. He calls for humanity in general to break free from dictatorships and use science and progress to make the world better instead.Hannah, now an impoverished laborer in a vineyard in Osterlich, hears the barber's speech on the radio, and is amazed when the Barber addresses her directly: ""Hannah, can you hear me? Wherever you are, look up, Hannah. The clouds are lifting. The sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world, a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and brutality. Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us. Look up, Hannah. Look up!"" As she rises, Mr. Jaeckel asks Hannah, ""Hannah, did you hear that?"" The girl silences him with a gesture, saying, ""Listen,"" and turns her face, radiant with joy and hope, toward the sunlight","
    
                    20 years after the end of WWI, in which the nation of Tomainia was on the losing side, Adenoid Hynkel has risen to power as the ruthless dictator of the country. He believes in a pure Aryan state and the decimation of the Jews. This situation is unknown to a simple Jewish Tomainian barber who has been hospitalized since a WWI battle. Upon his release the barber, who had been suffering from memory loss about the war, is shown the new persecuted life of the Jews by many living in the Jewish ghetto, including a washerwoman named Hannah with whom he begins a relationship. The barber is ultimately spared such persecution by Commander Schultz, whom he saved in that WWI battle. The lives of all Jews in Tomainia are eventually spared with a policy shift by Hynkel himself, who is doing so for ulterior motives. But those motives include a desire for world domination, starting with the invasion of neighboring Osterlich, which may be threatened by Benzino Napaloni, the dictator of neighboring Bacteria. Ultimately Schultz, who has turned traitor against Hynkel's regime, and the barber may be able to join forces to take control of the situation, using Schultz's inside knowledge of the regime's workings and the barber's uncanny resemblance to one of those in power.

                    During the last days of the First World War, a clumsy soldier saves the life of devoted military pilot Schultz. Unfortunately, their flight from the advancing enemy ends in a severe crash with the clumsy soldier losing his memory. After many years in the hospital, the amnesia patient gets released and reopens his old barber shop in the Jewish ghetto. But times have changed in the country of Tomania: Dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who accidentally looks very similar to the barber, has imposed his merciless grip on the country, and Jewish people are discriminated against. One day the barber gets in trouble and is brought before a commanding officer, who turns out to be his old comrade Schultz. The ghetto enjoys protection from then on. Meanwhile, Dictator Hynkel develops big plans: he wants to become Dictator of the whole world and needs a scapegoat for the public. Soon Schultz is being arrested for being too Jewish-friendly, and all Jews except those who managed to flee are transported into Concentration Camps. Hynkel is planning to march into Osterlich to show off against Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria, who has already deployed his troops along the small country's other border. Meanwhile, Schultz and the barber manage to escape, disguised in military uniforms. Luckily, Schultz and the barber are picked up by Tomanian forces and the barber is mixed up with Hynkel himself. The small barber now gets the once-in-a-lifetime chance to speak to the people of Osterlich and all of Tomania, who listen eagerly on the radio.

"3","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032910/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film opens with Jiminy Cricket sitting in a library singing ""When You Wish Upon A Star"". Addressing the camera, he starts to tell the audience why he believes in such a thing. Opening up a storybook of ""Pinocchio"", he explains how he came to the house of woodcarver Geppetto and his pets Figaro the cat and Cleo the fish. Geppetto has just made a little wooden puppet called Pinocchio, whom he loves dearly (""Little Wooden Puppet""). Before he goes to bed, Geppetto wishes upon the evening star that Pinocchio would become a real, live boy. As Geppetto sleeps, the Blue Fairy arrives and grants the wish partially; Pinocchio has come to life, but he is still a puppet and must prove himself worthy before becoming a real boy. However, being naive, he requires some guidance, and the Blue Fairy appoints Jiminy Cricket to be his ""conscience"". The cricket tells Pinocchio that anytime he needs Jiminy, all he needs to do is whistle (""Give a Little Whistle"").The next morning, Geppetto sends his son off to school. But Jiminy Cricket is still asleep! Pinocchio, alone and full of good intentions, heads off to school, but is sidetracked by the wily fox John Worthington Foulfellow and his simpleton accomplice Gideon the cat. Recognizing his uniqueness, the smooth-talking crooks decide to sell Pinocchio to marionette master Stromboli, whose travelling show is in town. Convincing Pinocchio that this is his chance to become an actor, Honest John and Gideon take the puppet to Stromboli (""Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee""). Jiminy Cricket jumps in and tries to stop Pinocchio from being taken away, but he is too late; Pinocchio becomes a success as part of Stromboli's show, dancing alongside normal puppets in a European-themed musical extravaganza (""I've Got No Strings""). Jiminy Cricket, feeling that he failed at his job, walks off into the night.Pinocchio tries to return home to Geppetto. Stromboli, not wanting to lose such a cash cow, locks the puppet in a bird cage. Alone in Stromboli's dark and damp caravan, Pinocchio whistles for Jiminy Cricket. He finds Pinocchio, but is not strong enough to unlock the bird cage. Suddenly, the Blue Fairy appears. Not wanting to admit he was naughty, Pinocchio tells a series of lies, but with every lie his nose grows longer. The Blue Fairy forgives him and lets him out of the cage, but warns him that he'll never become human if he keeps misbehaving. (She also restores his nose to its original size.)Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket escape from Stromboli and head for home. Yet it isn't long before the duo become separated, and once more Pinocchio bumps into Honest John and Gideon, who have been hired by a dubious coachman to round up boys to take to the anarchic Pleasure Island amusement park. Jiminy, realising that once again he has been too late, follows Pinocchio to Pleasure Island, where boys can be naughty as much as they like and treat themselves to beer and cigars. But there's a catch to all this; since they are acting like jackasses, the magic of the island gradually turns them into donkeys, which the coachman sells into a lifetime of humiliation and slavery in circuses and mines. Pinocchio starts to change into a donkey, growing long ears and a tail, but before the transformation is complete he manages to flee the horrible amusement park, and returns home. To his dismay, his father isn't there.A dove arrives with a note from the Blue Fairy explaining that Geppetto has gone to sea to search for his lost son and has been swallowed by the whale Monstro. Determined to save his father, Pinocchio and his reluctant conscience journey to the bottom of the sea. They find Geppetto in the belly of the whale, and escape by setting a fire in the belly of the sea monster, who sneezes them right out. In revenge, Monstro destroys Geppetto's raft. Without regard for his own safety, Pinocchio saves Geppetto from drowning but at the cost of his own life. Geppetto's wish is finally granted. Pinocchio's sacrifice has proved to the Blue Fairy that he is worthy, and he is brought back to life not as a puppet but as a real live boy.While Geppetto, Pinocchio, Figaro and Cleo celebrate, Jiminy Cricket steps outside to look at the wishing star. The cricket has now also proved himself to be a good conscience, and receives a gold badge.","
    
                    Inventor Gepetto creates a wooden marionette called Pinocchio. His wish that Pinocchio be a real boy is unexpectedly granted by a fairy. The fairy assigns Jiminy Cricket to act as Pinocchio's ""conscience"" and keep him out of trouble. Jiminy is not too successful in this endeavor and most of the film is spent with Pinocchio deep in trouble.

                    Toymaker Gepetto creates a wooden puppet toy named Pinocchio and wishes on a star that he would be a real boy. A kindly Blue Fairy appears and grants his wish thus making Pinocchio come alive. Pinocchio learns that he must prove himself worthy in order to make his father's wish come true. With help from tiny Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio comes across challenges of temptation such as a sly fox and his cat sidekick and a greedy puppeteer. His final challenge comes when he figures out his father goes missing by getting swallowed by the massive whale Monstro and must go find and save him.
                
                
                    Jiminy Cricket finds himself at the home of Geppetto, a simple carpenter and toy-maker. Geppetto is old and his only company is his cat, Figaro, and goldfish, Cleo. He has made a toy puppet, Pinocchio, and wishes that the puppet was a real boy. To his astonishment, this comes true. Pinocchio now sets about behaving like a real boy, with Jiminy as his guide and conscience, but the novelty of being a wooden boy soon attracts the attention of some unscrupulous characters.

The Blue Fairy brings a marionette to life after Geppetto wishes on a star for a son, and Jiminy Cricket is appointed the new boy's conscience. He has a devil of a time keeping up as Pinocchio is willingly lured through various forms of temptation, the most frightening of which leads him to Pleasure Island, where he drinks, smokes, and is almost turned into a jackass.

    Synopsis
    The film opens with Jiminy Cricket sitting in a library singing ""When You Wish Upon A Star"". Addressing the camera, he starts to tell the audience why he believes in such a thing. Opening up a storybook of ""Pinocchio"", he explains how he came to the house of woodcarver Geppetto and his pets Figaro the cat and Cleo the fish. Geppetto has just made a little wooden puppet called Pinocchio, whom he loves dearly (""Little Wooden Puppet""). Before he goes to bed, Geppetto wishes upon the evening star that Pinocchio would become a real, live boy. As Geppetto sleeps, the Blue Fairy arrives and grants the wish partially; Pinocchio has come to life, but he is still a puppet and must prove himself worthy before becoming a real boy. However, being naive, he requires some guidance, and the Blue Fairy appoints Jiminy Cricket to be his ""conscience"". The cricket tells Pinocchio that anytime he needs Jiminy, all he needs to do is whistle (""Give a Little Whistle"").The next morning, Geppetto sends his son off to school. But Jiminy Cricket is still asleep! Pinocchio, alone and full of good intentions, heads off to school, but is sidetracked by the wily fox John Worthington Foulfellow and his simpleton accomplice Gideon the cat. Recognizing his uniqueness, the smooth-talking crooks decide to sell Pinocchio to marionette master Stromboli, whose travelling show is in town. Convincing Pinocchio that this is his chance to become an actor, Honest John and Gideon take the puppet to Stromboli (""Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee""). Jiminy Cricket jumps in and tries to stop Pinocchio from being taken away, but he is too late; Pinocchio becomes a success as part of Stromboli's show, dancing alongside normal puppets in a European-themed musical extravaganza (""I've Got No Strings""). Jiminy Cricket, feeling that he failed at his job, walks off into the night.Pinocchio tries to return home to Geppetto. Stromboli, not wanting to lose such a cash cow, locks the puppet in a bird cage. Alone in Stromboli's dark and damp caravan, Pinocchio whistles for Jiminy Cricket. He finds Pinocchio, but is not strong enough to unlock the bird cage. Suddenly, the Blue Fairy appears. Not wanting to admit he was naughty, Pinocchio tells a series of lies, but with every lie his nose grows longer. The Blue Fairy forgives him and lets him out of the cage, but warns him that he'll never become human if he keeps misbehaving. (She also restores his nose to its original size.)Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket escape from Stromboli and head for home. Yet it isn't long before the duo become separated, and once more Pinocchio bumps into Honest John and Gideon, who have been hired by a dubious coachman to round up boys to take to the anarchic Pleasure Island amusement park. Jiminy, realising that once again he has been too late, follows Pinocchio to Pleasure Island, where boys can be naughty as much as they like and treat themselves to beer and cigars. But there's a catch to all this; since they are acting like jackasses, the magic of the island gradually turns them into donkeys, which the coachman sells into a lifetime of humiliation and slavery in circuses and mines. Pinocchio starts to change into a donkey, growing long ears and a tail, but before the transformation is complete he manages to flee the horrible amusement park, and returns home. To his dismay, his father isn't there.A dove arrives with a note from the Blue Fairy explaining that Geppetto has gone to sea to search for his lost son and has been swallowed by the whale Monstro. Determined to save his father, Pinocchio and his reluctant conscience journey to the bottom of the sea. They find Geppetto in the belly of the whale, and escape by setting a fire in the belly of the sea monster, who sneezes them right out. In revenge, Monstro destroys Geppetto's raft. Without regard for his own safety, Pinocchio saves Geppetto from drowning but at the cost of his own life. Geppetto's wish is finally granted. Pinocchio's sacrifice has proved to the Blue Fairy that he is worthy, and he is brought back to life not as a puppet but as a real live boy.While Geppetto, Pinocchio, Figaro and Cleo celebrate, Jiminy Cricket steps outside to look at the wishing star. The cricket has now also proved himself to be a good conscience, and receives a gold badge.

                    Philadelphia socialites Tracy Lord and C.K. Dexter Haven married impulsively, with their marriage and subsequent divorce being equally passionate. They broke up when Dexter's drinking became excessive, it a mechanism to cope with Tracy's unforgiving manner to the imperfect, imperfections which Dexter admits he readily has. Two years after their break-up, Tracy is about to remarry, the ceremony to take place at the Lord mansion. Tracy's bridegroom is nouveau riche businessman and aspiring politician George Kittredge, who is otherwise a rather ordinary man and who idolizes Tracy. The day before the wedding, three unexpected guests show up at the Lord mansion: Macaulay Connor (Mike to his friends), Elizabeth Imbrie - the two who are friends of Tracy's absent brother, Junius- and Dexter himself. Dexter, an employee of the tabloid Spy magazine, made a deal with its publisher and editor Sidney Kidd to get a story on Tracy's wedding - the wedding of the year - in return for Kidd not publishing a salacious story with accompanying photographs of Tracy's father, Seth Lord, with a New York showgirl named Tina Marra. In reality, Mike and Liz are the reporter and photographer respectively for Spy. Mike and Liz don't particularly like this assignment or working for Kidd, but they need to make a living as their chosen other fields as serious writer and painter don't pay the bills. A suspicious Tracy is onto them, the entire truth which Dexter admits to her. Tracy decides to turn the tables on Mike and Liz. However, hours before the wedding, as the more self-assured Dexter and Liz get to work on how to get the Lords out from under Spy's threats, Tracy and Mike, both inebriated, go on a journey of self-discovery with Tracy ultimately coming to her realizations a little faster than Mike.

"10","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032599/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) visits her former workplace, the busy office of New York City's Morning Post. She's there to tell her former boss, editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant) -- who's also her former husband -- that he needs to stop sending her letters and telegrams, and that she won't be coming back to work because she's getting married again.While she's in Walter's office, City Editor Duffy (Frank Orth) comes in to tell Walter that the governor hasn't signed the expected reprieve for a murderer, so the man will be executed in the morning. This will apparently make the paper look bad, so Walter tells Duffy to call the governor and push for the reprieve, offering in exchange the Morning Post's endorsement when the governor makes his expected run for the senate. Then Walter gets a call about the reporter who's supposed to be covering the murderer -- he's unavailable -- so Walter tries to convince Hildy to write one last story. She's having none of it. Her wedding is tomorrow, which comes as a shock to Walter, who claims he wants to remarry Hildy himself.Walter spends the rest of the movie, which all takes place in one day, trying to lure Hildy back into the life they shared. It's not immediately clear why Hildy would be interested; though they have an obvious connection and Walter does seem fond of her, he omits the courtesies most men paid to women in 1940: he doesn't light Hildy's cigarette, take off his hat in her presence, or hold the door for her. He insinuates himself into her lunch date with her fiancé, Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy), where he learns that Hildy and Bruce plan to live in Albany with Bruce's mother, and that the three of them are taking the 4 o'clock train to Albany.Hildy, Bruce, and Walter discuss the murder case over lunch. The policeman who was murdered was ""colored,"" which makes the case politically tricky for the sheriff and the mayor. Apparently they need the colored vote to win the upcoming election, and they don't think they'll get it if they don't execute the murderer. Walter gets Hildy excited about how to present the story to sway public opinion. Bruce says they can take the 6 o'clock train if she wants to do one last interview. Hildy backs off, but Walter goes to work on Bruce:""You argue with her! Otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands. How can you have any happiness after that?"" Walter proposes a deal: he'll buy a life insurance policy from Bruce (Hildy bids him up from $25,000 to $100,000) if Hildy writes a story on Earl Williams, the murderer. Hildy and Bruce accept. Bruce and Walter go back to Walter's office, where Bruce will have a doctor examine Walter to make sure he qualifies for the policy, while Hildy heads for the criminal courts building where Williams is being held. First, she makes Bruce hand over the cash he's carrying -- $500, ""all we have in the world"" -- because she's afraid Walter will somehow swindle him out of it or lure him into a craps game or something.The press room at the criminal courts building, where much of the movie takes place, is full of reporters -- Murphy (Porter Hall), Roy V. Bensinger (Ernest Truex), Endicott (Cliff Edwards), McCue (Roscoe Karns), Wilson (Frank Jenks), and Sanders (Regis Toomey). Some of the newsmen are playing poker while others work the phones. A couple are calling in updates to the Earl Williams story. One concerns the ""alienist"" -- a psychiatrist or psychologist -- who's due to see Williams that afternoon. (The law requires that an alienist interview Williams and declare him of sound mind before he can be executed.) There's a full range of political opinion represented in the room and not much love lost among them, but when Hildy walks in, it's clear she's well liked -- all the reporters are delighted to see her. When she tells them she's moving to Albany and getting married, they all laugh at the idea of Hildy singing lullabies.In Walter's office, the doctor pronounces him fit and when Bruce asks who should be the beneficiary of the policy, Walter names Hildy. Bruce isn't too happy about that -- ""I feel I should take care of her"" -- but Walter says this is a debt of honor for him, because he was such a bad husband and because he wants to make sure she's provided for in her old age. Duffy comes in with a certified check for $2500 to pay for the policy and Walter puts Bruce on the phone to Hildy, who advises him to put the check in the lining of his hat (she's afraid Walter will swipe it back). As Bruce is leaving, Walter points him out to Louie Peluso (Abner Biberman), an ostensibly reformed criminal who's been hanging around the office. Walter and Louie seem to have some kind of understanding.Back at the courts building, Hildy scores an interview with the condemned man. The warden, Cooley (Pat West), tells her the sheriff says no more interviews, but she bribes Cooley to let her in ($20) and promises she won't be long.Earl Williams (John Qualen) tells Hildy he couldn't plead insanity because he's ""just as sane as anybody else"" -- but he didn't mean to shoot the policeman he was convicted of killing. Hildy asks him about the enthusiasts in the park who make speeches on soapboxes; Williams spent time in the park before the killing because he'd lost his job. He remembers a man who talked about production for use: the idea that nothing should be manufactured that isn't useful, and that every object should be used for its intended purpose. And what's a gun for? ""Why, to shoot, of course!"" Hildy convinces Williams that he was thinking about production for use when he fired the gun that killed the policeman. As she leaves, she asks about the roses in Williams' cell; he says they're from Mollie Malloy, whose picture is on the wall. He describes her as beautiful and ""a wonderful person,"" but it's not clear what their relationship is.In the press room, the reporters wonder if Walter will really let Hildy go. ""Remember what he did to Roger Fenton when he wanted to go to Hollywood? Had him thrown in jail for arson!""""Forgery,"" says someone else.They're bantering that Hildy's marriage won't last more than six months when Mollie Malloy (Helen Mack) walks in. She's angry about how they've been writing about her (""I never said I loved Earl Williams and was willing to marry him on the gallows!""), but they're dismissive and tell her to leave them alone. Hildy comes in during this exchange. Mollie explains that she only met Williams once, the day before the shooting. He was walking around in the rain without a hat or coat, obviously distraught. He told her he'd been fired so she took him to her room to dry off and get warm. The reporters make cruel wisecracks (when she asks about a banging noise outside -- the executioners are testing the gallows -- someone says ""they're fixing up a pain in the neck for your boyfriend!"") and when she shames them, they try to throw her out. Hildy takes Mollie under her wing and they go out together.Once they're gone, the men seem much more dejected about Williams' situation than they were letting on -- maybe they even feel a little sorry about how they treated Mollie. When Hildy comes back, she takes a call from Bruce and rushes out, running into Sheriff Hartwell (Gene Lockhart) as she leaves. The reporters, who don't let their finer feelings interfere with business, ask the sheriff to hang Williams at 5 in the morning instead of 7 so they can get the story into their city editions. (He refuses.) They also accuse him of reprieving Williams twice so the hanging will occur conveniently just before the election in which Hartwell is running on a law-and-order platform.At the jail, Hildy learns that Bruce was arrested for stealing a watch. His accuser, of course, is Walter's friend Louie, who's known to the police as ""the biggest crook in town."" After Hildy bails him out, Bruce discovers in the taxi that his wallet is missing (though he still has Walter's check, having followed Hildy's advice to put it in his hat).The reporters in the press room are relishing Hildy's unfinished draft of her Williams interview (""anybody who can write like that ain't gonna give it up permanent to sew socks for a guy in the insurance business"") when she comes back, having left Bruce waiting in the cab. She calls Walter in a fury to tell him she's tearing up the story she wrote and getting on the train with his check; she won't give him the story because she knows he sent Louie to get Bruce arrested.The sheriff joins Dr. Eggelhoffer (Edwin Maxwell), the alienist, in his final interview with Earl Williams. In the press room, Hildy is making a flowery farewell speech when she's interrupted by the sound of gunfire outside. All the reporters run to the window and hear from the cops below that Earl Williams has escaped. They scramble for the phones. Hildy can't resist calling the news in to Walter and running after the rest of the press corps to get the story. She spots Warden Cooley in the chaotic jailyard, chases him down (in high heels!), and tackles him to the ground.In the press room, one reporter calls his office to report that Williams shot his way out of his interview with Eggelhoffer and the sheriff and escaped through a skylight; another reports that a tear bomb went off in the hands of the sheriff's bomb squad, and several deputies (all relatives of the sheriff, who seems to have a nepotism problem) have been hospitalized. The sheriff comes in in time to hear this and huffs indignantly but ineffectually (""after all I've done for you!""). Another newsman reports that a cleaning lady was shot in the leg by a deputy. They hear more shots outside. Someone speculates that the sheriff let Williams escape so Williams could vote for him; Hartwell leaves in disgust.Upon hearing further shots all the reporters leave the press room just as Hildy comes in; she grabs a phone and calls Walter. She tells him with evident delight and in a whisper that she's got an exclusive on how Williams got the gun and escaped. She says she had to give Cooley $450 of Bruce's money to get the story. Walter, smirking, swears he'll reimburse her. On his mother's grave. She points out that his mother's still alive, but gives him the story anyway:Dr. Eggelhoffer decided, as part of his examination, to re-enact the crime. This required a gun, which the sheriff supplied without thinking to remove the bullets first. Williams shot Egglehoffer ""in the classified ad"" and ran off. (Eggelhoffer wasn't badly hurt.) Hildy demands her $450 again and mentions that Bruce is waiting for her in a cab. Walter turns to Evangeline (Marion Martin), who's chatting with Louie, and sends her to meet Bruce; it's not clear what he expects her to do. Then he asks Louie to take $450 in counterfeit money to Hildy.Soon Hildy takes another call from Bruce, who's been arrested again -- something to do with Evangeline. Hildy can't bail him out until the money comes from Walter, who isn't answering the phone.The mayor (Clarence Kolb) walks in asking for the sheriff; the reporters try to pry a statement out of him. They throw around rumors about a Red (communist) uprising. Someone says the governor is calling out the militia and quotes the governor blaming the mayor and the sheriff for Williams' escape. The sheriff says they've located Williams and the rifle squad's about to recapture him; the reporters run off to see the fun. The mayor tells the sheriff he's pulling him off the ticket for the upcoming election. He scolds the sheriff for falsely accusing Williams of being a communist sympathizer and says they'll lose 200,000 votes if Williams doesn't hang. A man in a bowler hat comes in looking for Sheriff Hartwell; he's a messenger from the governor delivering a reprieve for Williams. He's interrupted by a call for the sheriff saying the rifle squad has Williams surrounded. The mayor tries to bribe the messenger, Joe Pettibone (Billy Gilbert), offering him a cushy job in the city sealer's office if he'll say he wasn't able to deliver the reprieve. Pettibone doesn't think his wife will like it, but the mayor offers further inducements while shooing Pettibone out the door. Then the mayor tells the sheriff to order the rifle squad to shoot to kill -- and offers a $500 reward for killing Williams.Louie comes into the press room, where Hildy dresses him down for what he did to Bruce. He gives her the counterfeit $450 and, when she insists, Bruce's wallet. She picks up the phone after locking the door behind him but is interrupted by Earl Williams, who climbs in through the window with a revolver. She reminds him that she's a friend. He's very agitated and shoots at the window shade when it startles him by rolling itself up. Hildy takes his gun away and has a busy few minutes calming Earl and juggling Bruce and Walter on the phone while someone knocks at the press room door. Bruce is apparently demanding that she come out; she tells him she's caught the murderer and can't leave. She tells Walter she needs him there. It's Mollie at the door. She and Earl have a brief reunion but there's another knock on the (still locked) door -- the reporters want back in. Hildy hides Williams in a roll-top desk and plants Mollie in the chair in front of the desk, pretending to feel faint. When she lets them in, the reporters speculate that Williams could still be in the building. Hildy tries to get them to do a floor-by-floor search. They accuse her of trying to get rid of them (which she is); she retorts that they're too lazy to go after the story.They're interrupted by the entrance of a well-dressed woman looking for Hildy, or more precisely, for Bruce's $450. She's Mrs. Baldwin (Alma Kruger), Bruce's mother, and she wants to know which of the reporters is the murderer Hildy told Bruce she caught. Hildy's conciliatory at first, but she realizes that if the reporters find Earl, he's toast. She denies telling Bruce that she caught the murderer, which leaves Mrs. Baldwin gasping with indignation. The reporters gang up on Hildy, but suddenly Mollie says she's the only one who knows where Earl is. Mollie is nearly hysterical and berates the reporters when they ask her to talk because they wouldn't listen to her before. Saying she'll give them a story, she jumps out the window just as Walter comes in with Louie. The reporters lean out the window, looking down at Mollie and the people trying to help her (someone thinks she moved, so she might not be dead). Hildy quietly tells Walter that Earl's in the desk. Walter peeks in. Earl wants out, but Walter tells him to stay put. Unfortunately Mrs. Baldwin is still in the room and wants to know what's in the desk. Hildy presents Walter to Mrs. Baldwin. Walter -- rude, as usual -- immediately tells Louie to take her away, which he does, introducing himself politely before lifting her right off the ground and walking off with her. Hildy, angry and tearful, wants to go after them, but Walter convinces her this is too good a story to walk out on. He says they can change the outcome of the election if they spin the story right, and she's caught up in it again.Walter decides they'll have to move the roll-top desk Earl is hiding in to the Morning Post office. Hildy starts typing another draft while Walter calls Duffy and tells him about the story -- ""Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post, exclusive! Tear out the whole front page! Never mind the European war, we've got something a whole lot bigger than that!"" He asks Duffy to send over some wrestlers they know to help with the desk. As he talks, Bruce tiptoes into the room. Hildy talks to him absent-mindedly as she types. He takes his counterfeit money, his check, and his wallet -- which he's surprised to find in her possession -- tries to convince her to come with him, and repeats several times that he's leaving on the 9 o'clock train. During this conversation, Walter's still talking to Duffy about the stories they have to cut or move to make way for Hildy's exclusive, with occasional rude asides to Bruce. Bruce leaves, saying bitterly to Hildy (who's not listening) that she never loved him, and Walter locks the door behind him.Earl opens the desk but closes it in a hurry when Walter says ""get back in there, you Mock Turtle!"" Hildy's still writing for all she's worth. She asks Walter where Bruce went and Walter lies that Bruce will be back. Soon a reporter knocks on the door: Roy Bensinger of the Tribune. He's a problem because Williams is hiding in his desk. Walter throws up a smokescreen of flattery, offers Bensinger a job at the Morning Post, and gives him an assignment. Then he calls Duffy and tells him to keep Bensinger busy for a few hours, then toss him down the stairs.Hildy realizes that Bruce isn't coming back because (she finally remembers) he's taking the 9 o'clock train. Walter says dismissively that it's already too late to catch him and measures the desk with his hands, deciding that it's too big to fit through the window. Louie comes back, very beaten up. He reports that the cab he and Mrs. Baldwin were riding in ran into a carload of cops driving on the wrong side of the street. Louie didn't wait around to see how the old lady was; Hildy fears she's dead and feels responsible. She starts calling hospitals while Walter takes a call from Butch the wrestler, who's having trouble getting away from his girlfriend. Walter sends Louie out to find some other muscle to move the desk. Hildy tries to leave to find Mrs. Baldwin but she's swept back into the press room by the returning press corps and the sheriff.They crowd around Hildy, insisting she tell them where Williams is. In the scuffle, the revolver falls off the table and the sheriff recognizes it. Walter claims to have given Hildy the gun to protect herself from Williams, but the sheriff says this is the gun Williams used to escape and the sheriff knows because it's his gun. The reporters are delighted because the sheriff has foolishly confirmed the story about how Williams got hold of a gun. The sheriff gives Hildy three minutes to tell him where Williams is. He threatens to arrest both Hildy and Walter and fine the Morning Post $10,000. Walter, unimpressed, calls him names. Then Hartwell says he'll impound the Post's property, so Walter dares him to move the roll-top desk out of the building. Hartwell's instructing his goons to do it when two policemen come in with a disheveled Mrs. Baldwin, who accuses Walter of having her kidnapped. This is music to the sheriff's ears, but Walter denies it and accuses Mrs. Baldwin of being drunk and going joy-riding. She retorts that Walter had her kidnapped because she knows they're hiding the murderer in the press room. Walter emphasizes his denial by pounding on the roll-top desk, to which Earl unfortunately responds by pounding back. The sheriff and deputies pull their guns on the desk. Mrs. Baldwin runs from the room, straight into the arms of her son. Hildy tells the sheriff that shooting the desk is murder, so he has his deputies raise the roll top. Williams says ""go ahead, shoot me!"" and can barely stand when they pull him out.Reporters all over the room are calling in the story as it happens. Walter gets Duffy on the line and says ""the Morning Post turned Williams over to the sheriff!"" as the cops handcuff him to Hildy. Suddenly the other reporters decide they need to talk to Mrs. Baldwin and rush out, leaving Hildy, Walter, the sheriff, and one cop in the room when the mayor walks in. He congratulates the sheriff on catching Hildy and Walter obstructing justice and tells them they'll get ten years apiece. As the mayor and the sheriff gloat, the governor's messenger, Mr. Pettibone, comes back. His wife seems to have explained to him that the city sealer job is a bribe, and he rejects it, with explicit details, in the presence of Walter and Hildy who understand all the implications. The mayor tries to deny it, but gets nowhere. Bowing to the inevitable, the mayor professes to be delighted that it won't be necessary to execute Williams and has the sheriff release Walter and Hildy from the handcuffs. The two sides trade threats: from the Morning Post team, an exposé followed by a recall of the mayor, and ""a thumping big libel suit"" from the mayor. Hildy maliciously speculates that the mayor and the sheriff will get ten years apiece.The mayor and the sheriff depart with Pettibone and Walter gets back on the phone with Duffy. Hildy reminisces about a long-ago case where she and Walter stole a dead woman's stomach to prove she'd been poisoned, then had to hide out for a week in a hotel (which appears to be how they got together). He tries to send her off to Albany after Bruce, and seems to mean it this time, but she isn't sure she wants to go -- and she really wants to finish the story. The phone rings as she walks out the door and she comes back find that it's Bruce calling, once again, from the police station -- he's been arrested for trying the pass the counterfeit money she gave him. Hildy hangs up and breaks down sobbing. Walter tries to comfort her; he's worried because she's never cried before. She finally chokes out ""I thought you were really sending me away with Bruce. I didn't know you had him locked up. I though you didn't love me!"" Within moments they're planning to get married again and take a two-week honeymoon in Niagara Falls -- which quickly becomes a working trip to Albany, because Duffy reports there's a strike there. As they leave the press room Walter wonders if Bruce can put them up in Albany. He tells Hildy she should carry the suitcase she's clutching in her arms by the handle but true to form, doesn't offer to carry it for her.","
    
                    Having been away for four months, Hildy Johnson walks into the offices of the New York City based The Morning Post, where she is a star reporter, to tell her boss, editor Walter Burns, that she is quitting. The reason for her absence was among other things to get a Reno divorce, from, of all people, Walter, who admits he was a bad husband. Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life, whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard-boiled reporter than subservient homemaker. Hildy has also come to tell Walter that she is taking the afternoon train to Albany, where she will be getting married tomorrow to staid straight-laced insurance agent, Bruce Baldwin, with whose mother they will live, at least for the first year. Walter doesn't want to lose Hildy, either as a reporter or a wife, and if he does, doesn't believe Bruce is worthy of her. Walter does whatever he can at least to delay Hildy and Bruce's trip, long enough to persuade Hildy to stay for good. His plan includes doing whatever he can to place Bruce in a bad light, while dangling a big story under her nose, namely covering what the newspaper believes is the unfair imminent execution of convicted cop killer, Earl Williams. Hildy doesn't trust Walter in dealing with her and Bruce in an above board manner, but the lure of what potentially may become the biggest story in years, which includes true love, a bumbling sheriff and a corrupt mayor, the latter's actions largely in light of an upcoming election, may prove to be too much for Hildy to resist, especially if it ends up being an exclusive. Regardless of the story outcome, Hildy will have to decide if the thrill of the chase was worth the anguish on her personal life.

    Synopsis
    Newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) visits her former workplace, the busy office of New York City's Morning Post. She's there to tell her former boss, editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant) -- who's also her former husband -- that he needs to stop sending her letters and telegrams, and that she won't be coming back to work because she's getting married again.While she's in Walter's office, City Editor Duffy (Frank Orth) comes in to tell Walter that the governor hasn't signed the expected reprieve for a murderer, so the man will be executed in the morning. This will apparently make the paper look bad, so Walter tells Duffy to call the governor and push for the reprieve, offering in exchange the Morning Post's endorsement when the governor makes his expected run for the senate. Then Walter gets a call about the reporter who's supposed to be covering the murderer -- he's unavailable -- so Walter tries to convince Hildy to write one last story. She's having none of it. Her wedding is tomorrow, which comes as a shock to Walter, who claims he wants to remarry Hildy himself.Walter spends the rest of the movie, which all takes place in one day, trying to lure Hildy back into the life they shared. It's not immediately clear why Hildy would be interested; though they have an obvious connection and Walter does seem fond of her, he omits the courtesies most men paid to women in 1940: he doesn't light Hildy's cigarette, take off his hat in her presence, or hold the door for her. He insinuates himself into her lunch date with her fiancé, Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy), where he learns that Hildy and Bruce plan to live in Albany with Bruce's mother, and that the three of them are taking the 4 o'clock train to Albany.Hildy, Bruce, and Walter discuss the murder case over lunch. The policeman who was murdered was ""colored,"" which makes the case politically tricky for the sheriff and the mayor. Apparently they need the colored vote to win the upcoming election, and they don't think they'll get it if they don't execute the murderer. Walter gets Hildy excited about how to present the story to sway public opinion. Bruce says they can take the 6 o'clock train if she wants to do one last interview. Hildy backs off, but Walter goes to work on Bruce:""You argue with her! Otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands. How can you have any happiness after that?"" Walter proposes a deal: he'll buy a life insurance policy from Bruce (Hildy bids him up from $25,000 to $100,000) if Hildy writes a story on Earl Williams, the murderer. Hildy and Bruce accept. Bruce and Walter go back to Walter's office, where Bruce will have a doctor examine Walter to make sure he qualifies for the policy, while Hildy heads for the criminal courts building where Williams is being held. First, she makes Bruce hand over the cash he's carrying -- $500, ""all we have in the world"" -- because she's afraid Walter will somehow swindle him out of it or lure him into a craps game or something.The press room at the criminal courts building, where much of the movie takes place, is full of reporters -- Murphy (Porter Hall), Roy V. Bensinger (Ernest Truex), Endicott (Cliff Edwards), McCue (Roscoe Karns), Wilson (Frank Jenks), and Sanders (Regis Toomey). Some of the newsmen are playing poker while others work the phones. A couple are calling in updates to the Earl Williams story. One concerns the ""alienist"" -- a psychiatrist or psychologist -- who's due to see Williams that afternoon. (The law requires that an alienist interview Williams and declare him of sound mind before he can be executed.) There's a full range of political opinion represented in the room and not much love lost among them, but when Hildy walks in, it's clear she's well liked -- all the reporters are delighted to see her. When she tells them she's moving to Albany and getting married, they all laugh at the idea of Hildy singing lullabies.In Walter's office, the doctor pronounces him fit and when Bruce asks who should be the beneficiary of the policy, Walter names Hildy. Bruce isn't too happy about that -- ""I feel I should take care of her"" -- but Walter says this is a debt of honor for him, because he was such a bad husband and because he wants to make sure she's provided for in her old age. Duffy comes in with a certified check for $2500 to pay for the policy and Walter puts Bruce on the phone to Hildy, who advises him to put the check in the lining of his hat (she's afraid Walter will swipe it back). As Bruce is leaving, Walter points him out to Louie Peluso (Abner Biberman), an ostensibly reformed criminal who's been hanging around the office. Walter and Louie seem to have some kind of understanding.Back at the courts building, Hildy scores an interview with the condemned man. The warden, Cooley (Pat West), tells her the sheriff says no more interviews, but she bribes Cooley to let her in ($20) and promises she won't be long.Earl Williams (John Qualen) tells Hildy he couldn't plead insanity because he's ""just as sane as anybody else"" -- but he didn't mean to shoot the policeman he was convicted of killing. Hildy asks him about the enthusiasts in the park who make speeches on soapboxes; Williams spent time in the park before the killing because he'd lost his job. He remembers a man who talked about production for use: the idea that nothing should be manufactured that isn't useful, and that every object should be used for its intended purpose. And what's a gun for? ""Why, to shoot, of course!"" Hildy convinces Williams that he was thinking about production for use when he fired the gun that killed the policeman. As she leaves, she asks about the roses in Williams' cell; he says they're from Mollie Malloy, whose picture is on the wall. He describes her as beautiful and ""a wonderful person,"" but it's not clear what their relationship is.In the press room, the reporters wonder if Walter will really let Hildy go. ""Remember what he did to Roger Fenton when he wanted to go to Hollywood? Had him thrown in jail for arson!""""Forgery,"" says someone else.They're bantering that Hildy's marriage won't last more than six months when Mollie Malloy (Helen Mack) walks in. She's angry about how they've been writing about her (""I never said I loved Earl Williams and was willing to marry him on the gallows!""), but they're dismissive and tell her to leave them alone. Hildy comes in during this exchange. Mollie explains that she only met Williams once, the day before the shooting. He was walking around in the rain without a hat or coat, obviously distraught. He told her he'd been fired so she took him to her room to dry off and get warm. The reporters make cruel wisecracks (when she asks about a banging noise outside -- the executioners are testing the gallows -- someone says ""they're fixing up a pain in the neck for your boyfriend!"") and when she shames them, they try to throw her out. Hildy takes Mollie under her wing and they go out together.Once they're gone, the men seem much more dejected about Williams' situation than they were letting on -- maybe they even feel a little sorry about how they treated Mollie. When Hildy comes back, she takes a call from Bruce and rushes out, running into Sheriff Hartwell (Gene Lockhart) as she leaves. The reporters, who don't let their finer feelings interfere with business, ask the sheriff to hang Williams at 5 in the morning instead of 7 so they can get the story into their city editions. (He refuses.) They also accuse him of reprieving Williams twice so the hanging will occur conveniently just before the election in which Hartwell is running on a law-and-order platform.At the jail, Hildy learns that Bruce was arrested for stealing a watch. His accuser, of course, is Walter's friend Louie, who's known to the police as ""the biggest crook in town."" After Hildy bails him out, Bruce discovers in the taxi that his wallet is missing (though he still has Walter's check, having followed Hildy's advice to put it in his hat).The reporters in the press room are relishing Hildy's unfinished draft of her Williams interview (""anybody who can write like that ain't gonna give it up permanent to sew socks for a guy in the insurance business"") when she comes back, having left Bruce waiting in the cab. She calls Walter in a fury to tell him she's tearing up the story she wrote and getting on the train with his check; she won't give him the story because she knows he sent Louie to get Bruce arrested.The sheriff joins Dr. Eggelhoffer (Edwin Maxwell), the alienist, in his final interview with Earl Williams. In the press room, Hildy is making a flowery farewell speech when she's interrupted by the sound of gunfire outside. All the reporters run to the window and hear from the cops below that Earl Williams has escaped. They scramble for the phones. Hildy can't resist calling the news in to Walter and running after the rest of the press corps to get the story. She spots Warden Cooley in the chaotic jailyard, chases him down (in high heels!), and tackles him to the ground.In the press room, one reporter calls his office to report that Williams shot his way out of his interview with Eggelhoffer and the sheriff and escaped through a skylight; another reports that a tear bomb went off in the hands of the sheriff's bomb squad, and several deputies (all relatives of the sheriff, who seems to have a nepotism problem) have been hospitalized. The sheriff comes in in time to hear this and huffs indignantly but ineffectually (""after all I've done for you!""). Another newsman reports that a cleaning lady was shot in the leg by a deputy. They hear more shots outside. Someone speculates that the sheriff let Williams escape so Williams could vote for him; Hartwell leaves in disgust.Upon hearing further shots all the reporters leave the press room just as Hildy comes in; she grabs a phone and calls Walter. She tells him with evident delight and in a whisper that she's got an exclusive on how Williams got the gun and escaped. She says she had to give Cooley $450 of Bruce's money to get the story. Walter, smirking, swears he'll reimburse her. On his mother's grave. She points out that his mother's still alive, but gives him the story anyway:Dr. Eggelhoffer decided, as part of his examination, to re-enact the crime. This required a gun, which the sheriff supplied without thinking to remove the bullets first. Williams shot Egglehoffer ""in the classified ad"" and ran off. (Eggelhoffer wasn't badly hurt.) Hildy demands her $450 again and mentions that Bruce is waiting for her in a cab. Walter turns to Evangeline (Marion Martin), who's chatting with Louie, and sends her to meet Bruce; it's not clear what he expects her to do. Then he asks Louie to take $450 in counterfeit money to Hildy.Soon Hildy takes another call from Bruce, who's been arrested again -- something to do with Evangeline. Hildy can't bail him out until the money comes from Walter, who isn't answering the phone.The mayor (Clarence Kolb) walks in asking for the sheriff; the reporters try to pry a statement out of him. They throw around rumors about a Red (communist) uprising. Someone says the governor is calling out the militia and quotes the governor blaming the mayor and the sheriff for Williams' escape. The sheriff says they've located Williams and the rifle squad's about to recapture him; the reporters run off to see the fun. The mayor tells the sheriff he's pulling him off the ticket for the upcoming election. He scolds the sheriff for falsely accusing Williams of being a communist sympathizer and says they'll lose 200,000 votes if Williams doesn't hang. A man in a bowler hat comes in looking for Sheriff Hartwell; he's a messenger from the governor delivering a reprieve for Williams. He's interrupted by a call for the sheriff saying the rifle squad has Williams surrounded. The mayor tries to bribe the messenger, Joe Pettibone (Billy Gilbert), offering him a cushy job in the city sealer's office if he'll say he wasn't able to deliver the reprieve. Pettibone doesn't think his wife will like it, but the mayor offers further inducements while shooing Pettibone out the door. Then the mayor tells the sheriff to order the rifle squad to shoot to kill -- and offers a $500 reward for killing Williams.Louie comes into the press room, where Hildy dresses him down for what he did to Bruce. He gives her the counterfeit $450 and, when she insists, Bruce's wallet. She picks up the phone after locking the door behind him but is interrupted by Earl Williams, who climbs in through the window with a revolver. She reminds him that she's a friend. He's very agitated and shoots at the window shade when it startles him by rolling itself up. Hildy takes his gun away and has a busy few minutes calming Earl and juggling Bruce and Walter on the phone while someone knocks at the press room door. Bruce is apparently demanding that she come out; she tells him she's caught the murderer and can't leave. She tells Walter she needs him there. It's Mollie at the door. She and Earl have a brief reunion but there's another knock on the (still locked) door -- the reporters want back in. Hildy hides Williams in a roll-top desk and plants Mollie in the chair in front of the desk, pretending to feel faint. When she lets them in, the reporters speculate that Williams could still be in the building. Hildy tries to get them to do a floor-by-floor search. They accuse her of trying to get rid of them (which she is); she retorts that they're too lazy to go after the story.They're interrupted by the entrance of a well-dressed woman looking for Hildy, or more precisely, for Bruce's $450. She's Mrs. Baldwin (Alma Kruger), Bruce's mother, and she wants to know which of the reporters is the murderer Hildy told Bruce she caught. Hildy's conciliatory at first, but she realizes that if the reporters find Earl, he's toast. She denies telling Bruce that she caught the murderer, which leaves Mrs. Baldwin gasping with indignation. The reporters gang up on Hildy, but suddenly Mollie says she's the only one who knows where Earl is. Mollie is nearly hysterical and berates the reporters when they ask her to talk because they wouldn't listen to her before. Saying she'll give them a story, she jumps out the window just as Walter comes in with Louie. The reporters lean out the window, looking down at Mollie and the people trying to help her (someone thinks she moved, so she might not be dead). Hildy quietly tells Walter that Earl's in the desk. Walter peeks in. Earl wants out, but Walter tells him to stay put. Unfortunately Mrs. Baldwin is still in the room and wants to know what's in the desk. Hildy presents Walter to Mrs. Baldwin. Walter -- rude, as usual -- immediately tells Louie to take her away, which he does, introducing himself politely before lifting her right off the ground and walking off with her. Hildy, angry and tearful, wants to go after them, but Walter convinces her this is too good a story to walk out on. He says they can change the outcome of the election if they spin the story right, and she's caught up in it again.Walter decides they'll have to move the roll-top desk Earl is hiding in to the Morning Post office. Hildy starts typing another draft while Walter calls Duffy and tells him about the story -- ""Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post, exclusive! Tear out the whole front page! Never mind the European war, we've got something a whole lot bigger than that!"" He asks Duffy to send over some wrestlers they know to help with the desk. As he talks, Bruce tiptoes into the room. Hildy talks to him absent-mindedly as she types. He takes his counterfeit money, his check, and his wallet -- which he's surprised to find in her possession -- tries to convince her to come with him, and repeats several times that he's leaving on the 9 o'clock train. During this conversation, Walter's still talking to Duffy about the stories they have to cut or move to make way for Hildy's exclusive, with occasional rude asides to Bruce. Bruce leaves, saying bitterly to Hildy (who's not listening) that she never loved him, and Walter locks the door behind him.Earl opens the desk but closes it in a hurry when Walter says ""get back in there, you Mock Turtle!"" Hildy's still writing for all she's worth. She asks Walter where Bruce went and Walter lies that Bruce will be back. Soon a reporter knocks on the door: Roy Bensinger of the Tribune. He's a problem because Williams is hiding in his desk. Walter throws up a smokescreen of flattery, offers Bensinger a job at the Morning Post, and gives him an assignment. Then he calls Duffy and tells him to keep Bensinger busy for a few hours, then toss him down the stairs.Hildy realizes that Bruce isn't coming back because (she finally remembers) he's taking the 9 o'clock train. Walter says dismissively that it's already too late to catch him and measures the desk with his hands, deciding that it's too big to fit through the window. Louie comes back, very beaten up. He reports that the cab he and Mrs. Baldwin were riding in ran into a carload of cops driving on the wrong side of the street. Louie didn't wait around to see how the old lady was; Hildy fears she's dead and feels responsible. She starts calling hospitals while Walter takes a call from Butch the wrestler, who's having trouble getting away from his girlfriend. Walter sends Louie out to find some other muscle to move the desk. Hildy tries to leave to find Mrs. Baldwin but she's swept back into the press room by the returning press corps and the sheriff.They crowd around Hildy, insisting she tell them where Williams is. In the scuffle, the revolver falls off the table and the sheriff recognizes it. Walter claims to have given Hildy the gun to protect herself from Williams, but the sheriff says this is the gun Williams used to escape and the sheriff knows because it's his gun. The reporters are delighted because the sheriff has foolishly confirmed the story about how Williams got hold of a gun. The sheriff gives Hildy three minutes to tell him where Williams is. He threatens to arrest both Hildy and Walter and fine the Morning Post $10,000. Walter, unimpressed, calls him names. Then Hartwell says he'll impound the Post's property, so Walter dares him to move the roll-top desk out of the building. Hartwell's instructing his goons to do it when two policemen come in with a disheveled Mrs. Baldwin, who accuses Walter of having her kidnapped. This is music to the sheriff's ears, but Walter denies it and accuses Mrs. Baldwin of being drunk and going joy-riding. She retorts that Walter had her kidnapped because she knows they're hiding the murderer in the press room. Walter emphasizes his denial by pounding on the roll-top desk, to which Earl unfortunately responds by pounding back. The sheriff and deputies pull their guns on the desk. Mrs. Baldwin runs from the room, straight into the arms of her son. Hildy tells the sheriff that shooting the desk is murder, so he has his deputies raise the roll top. Williams says ""go ahead, shoot me!"" and can barely stand when they pull him out.Reporters all over the room are calling in the story as it happens. Walter gets Duffy on the line and says ""the Morning Post turned Williams over to the sheriff!"" as the cops handcuff him to Hildy. Suddenly the other reporters decide they need to talk to Mrs. Baldwin and rush out, leaving Hildy, Walter, the sheriff, and one cop in the room when the mayor walks in. He congratulates the sheriff on catching Hildy and Walter obstructing justice and tells them they'll get ten years apiece. As the mayor and the sheriff gloat, the governor's messenger, Mr. Pettibone, comes back. His wife seems to have explained to him that the city sealer job is a bribe, and he rejects it, with explicit details, in the presence of Walter and Hildy who understand all the implications. The mayor tries to deny it, but gets nowhere. Bowing to the inevitable, the mayor professes to be delighted that it won't be necessary to execute Williams and has the sheriff release Walter and Hildy from the handcuffs. The two sides trade threats: from the Morning Post team, an exposé followed by a recall of the mayor, and ""a thumping big libel suit"" from the mayor. Hildy maliciously speculates that the mayor and the sheriff will get ten years apiece.The mayor and the sheriff depart with Pettibone and Walter gets back on the phone with Duffy. Hildy reminisces about a long-ago case where she and Walter stole a dead woman's stomach to prove she'd been poisoned, then had to hide out for a week in a hotel (which appears to be how they got together). He tries to send her off to Albany after Bruce, and seems to mean it this time, but she isn't sure she wants to go -- and she really wants to finish the story. The phone rings as she walks out the door and she comes back find that it's Bruce calling, once again, from the police station -- he's been arrested for trying the pass the counterfeit money she gave him. Hildy hangs up and breaks down sobbing. Walter tries to comfort her; he's worried because she's never cried before. She finally chokes out ""I thought you were really sending me away with Bruce. I didn't know you had him locked up. I though you didn't love me!"" Within moments they're planning to get married again and take a two-week honeymoon in Niagara Falls -- which quickly becomes a working trip to Albany, because Duffy reports there's a strike there. As they leave the press room Walter wonders if Bruce can put them up in Albany. He tells Hildy she should carry the suitcase she's clutching in her arms by the handle but true to form, doesn't offer to carry it for her.

Before the ceremony can be performed, however, Roy is called to the front and Myra is fired for her impetuousness by Madame Olga Kirowa, the troupe's tyranical ballet mistress. When Myra's friend Kitty sticks up for her, Madame Kirowa also fires her. Unable to find work in another ballet or show, the two dancers soon find themselves broke and hungry. One afternoon, Myra is supposed to meet Roy's aristocratic mother for the first time. While waiting, Myra sees a notice about Roy's death in the newspaper and faints. When Lady Margaret arrives, Myra cannot tell her the terrible news, and her erratic behavior shocks and angers Roy's mother, who leaves in disgust. Myra then falls ill and lies close to death from grief. To earn money to cover her friend's medical expenses, Kitty drifts into street walking. When Myra recovers, she is touched by her friend's sacrifice, and with no desire to live, she, too, becomes a prostitute. One year later, Roy returns to London, and the first sight that he sees upon getting off the train is Myra, who has come to pick up soldiers. He believes that she has come to meet him, and knowing nothing of her life in the past year, takes her home to his family estate in Scotland. Although Myra tries to convince herself that they can be happy, she soon realizes that her past will ruin Roy's life and, after confessing all to his mother, she runs away. Roy follows, despite Kitty's revelations about Myra, but she eludes him and kills herself by throwing herself in front of an onrushing truck on Waterloo Bridge. Clutching the good luck charm that he had once given Myra, Roy leaves for the front.

                    Geoffrey Thorpe is an adventurous and dashing pirate, who feels that he should pirate the Spanish ships for the good of England. In one such battle, he overtakes a Spanish ship and when he comes aboard he finds Dona Maria, a beautiful Spanish royal. He is overwhelmed by her beauty, but she will have nothing to do with him because of his pirating ways (which include taking her prized jewels). To show his noble side, he suprises her by returning the jewels, and she begins to fall for him. When the ship reaches England, Queen Elizabeth is outraged at the actions of Thorpe and demands that he quit pirating. Because he cannot do this, Thorpe is sent on a mission and in the process becomes a prisoner of the Spaniards. Meanwhile, Dona Maria pines for Thorpe and when he escapes he returns to England to uncover some deadly secrets. Exciting duels follow as Thorpe must expose the evil and win Dona Maria's heart.

The Stage Manager (Frank Craven) walks in and out of scenes, narrating background and context, announcing flashbacks in time, or telling characters to start talking and be quiet. At one point, he solicits questions from the audience. The narrator first shows what the town of Grovers Corners, New Hampshire, looks like in 1940, then shows what it was like in 1901. He points out the various Protestant churches, the location of the railroad tracks, and mentions that the new Polish immigrants who work in the mill live on the other side of the railroad tracks, separate from the Anglo pioneer stock who constitute the establishment. He narrates facts and statistics, such as that the population is 2642, not counting about 500 Polish immigrants, and that 85 per cent of the voters vote Republican.The narrator shows us, in the graveyard, that the tombstone names are the same from generation to generation since about 1680. Just like the names, nothing much changes in this town, any change comes very very slowly.In the rest of the film, there is no conflict to be resolved, as the characters are not real people but nostalgic archetypes whose purpose is to represent everyone in a typical life and to make philosophical points that are enunciated at the end. The town is a nostalgic archetype also, a mythical place where people are born, grow up, work, fall in love, get married, and die.The external world, symbolized once in a while by the whistle of the train, intrudes on the myth only sporadically and mildly.Act 1 presents an ordinary day in 1901.Dr. Gibbs (Thomas Mitchell) is the town doctor, who lives with his wife (Fay Bainter) and their son George (William Holden), a high school student. Next door live the newspaper owner Mr. Webb with his wife (Beulah Bondi) and their daughter Emily (Martha Scott), also a high school student.Everybody knows everybody else, they all interact comfortably with each other, nobody locks their doors at night. White picket fences border the nicer homes.A young newspaper boy delivers the daily newspaper every morning. A milkman delivers milk to the families daily, entering into the kitchens directly and chatting with the housewives. The milkman uses a quaint tool to measure out the milk, a kind of tubular shovel that allows him to pour the measured milk into the customers own containers.The mother of Mrs. Gibbs has died, leaving her a small legacy. She discusses what to do with the money with her neighbor, telling her she has two goals, one, to finally have a relaxing vacation with her overworked husband, and two, and she wants to experience something of life outside of Grovers Corners, going to see Paris, France, saying It seems to me, once in your life, before you die, you ought to see a country where they don't speak any English and they don't even want to.The mothers morning routines in feeding their children warm breakfasts and sending them off to school even on cold winter days are quaintly over-typical, including the worries about wearing warm clothes so as not to catch colds. Archetypal also are the minor sibling rivalries within the families.The two neighbor ladies gossip about how the choirmaster at their church drinks too much.There are also over-typical conversations of the parents with their teenagers. At the Gibbs household, the father has to have a serious talk with George because he neglects to be helpful to his mother at home, as in chopping the wood for cooking. The way George responds is unreal, as he is an archetypal good boy: with just two sentences from his father he immediately reforms.Later on we see a church choir practice. It's axiomatic that in just about any church, the music director, organist or choirmaster is a gay man. Mr. Stinson (Philip Wood) is gay, no question about it.

                    Mr. Morgan, the town druggist, acts the the Everyman to tell the story of his town, Grover's Corners, New Hampshire, which in turn acts as the Anyplace. The story he tells is one of life, love and death, universal to anywhere in the world. He starts the story in 1901 solely to set the stage. Dr. Frank and Julia Gibbs and Charles and Myrtle Webb have been long time friends and next door neighbors. The Webb's oldest offspring, Emily Webb, in her mid to late teens, is an academically bright girl. The Gibbs' oldest offspring, George Gibbs, also in his mid to late teens, has focused his energies in life thus far on baseball. But he begins to think about his future, wanting to be a farmer, he being told that he can work for his Uncle Luke and eventually inherit the farm if he's any good at it. While Emily has always been secretly in love with George, George begins to notice Emily romantically for the first time, although he in turn doesn't tell her of his feelings for her. Mr. Morgan then moves the story to 1904, just before George and Emily are about to get married, he providing some background as to the less than smooth road to them being a couple, and their current doubts about what being married and being a grown-up mean. The last phase of the story takes place in 1913, when Emily is about to give birth to her and George's second child. In the process, Emily reflects on her life and thinks about loved ones that are no longer in the world, making her wish she had seized the happy moments in life when they happened.

                    Interesting to note that the film was made in 1940, 1 year before America's entry into the European war against Hitler. The movie depicts Germany in 1933. In 1938 the 'night of broken glass' took place. Interesting to note the attitudes portrayed in the film, definitely anti-Nazi.

                    When transplanted Texan Bob Seton arrives in Lawrence, Kansas he finds much to like about the place, especially Mary McCloud, daughter of the local banker. Politics is in the air however. It's just prior to the civil war and there is already a sharp division in the Territory as to whether it will remain slave-free. When he gets the opportunity to run for marshal, Seton finds himself running against the respected local schoolteacher, William Cantrell. Not is what it seems however. While acting as the upstanding citizen in public, Cantrell is dangerously ambitious and is prepared to do anything to make his mark, and his fortune, on the Territory. When he loses the race for marshal, he forms a group of raiders who run guns into the territory and rob and terrorize settlers throughout the territory. Eventually donning Confederate uniforms, it is left to Seton and the good citizens of Lawrence to face Cantrell and his raiders in one final clash.

Quentin Quale is heading west to find his fortune; he meets the crafty but simple brothers Joseph and Rusty Panello in a train station, where they steal all his money. They're heading west, too, because they've heard you can just pick the gold off the ground. Once there, they befriend an old miner named Dan Wilson whose property, Dead Man's Gulch, has no gold. They loan him their last ten dollars so he can go start life anew, and for collateral, he gives them the deed to the Gulch. Unbeknownst to Wilson, the son of his longtime rival, Terry Turner (who's also in love with his daughter, Eva), has contacted the railroad to arrange for them to build through the land, making the old man rich and hopefully resolving the feud. But the evil Red Baxter, owner of a saloon, tricks the boys out of the deed, and it's up to them - as well as Quale, who naturally finds his way out west anyway - to save the day.

Colonel Jaffrey Pyncheon stole the land from Matthew Maule, who put a curse on the family. Colonel Pyncheon and many of his male descendants died by choking on their own blood during a sudden seizure.On a rainy night in 1828, the current Jaffrey Pyncheon arrives at Seven Gables. His father, Gerald, has summoned him from his legal practice in Boston. He is greeted by Hepzibah Pyncheon, a distant cousin who is engaged to his brother Clifford. When the family is assembled, Gerald gives Jaffrey the unwelcome news that Seven Gables is to be sold the next day. The family fortune is gone because of Gerald's poor management and he is deeply in debt. Clifford is in agreement that the house must be sold. He plans to use his share of the profits to marry Hepzibah and move to New York.After everyone is in bed, Jaffrey sneaks up to the attic. He opens an old trunk and rummages through the papers inside. Clifford catches him and asks what he is doing. Jaffrey is looking for a paper signed by King Charles II that gave the Pyncheon family a huge land grant in what is now Maine. Excitedly he tells Clifford that if he will change his mind and stand firm against the sale, they can search for the paper. If they find it, the government will have to reimburse them. But Clifford says that is just one of many legends about the family, including the one about half a million in gold hidden somewhere in the house. None of them are true.The next morning, Clifford avoids Jaffrey and his father. He and Hepzibah discuss their plans for the future. Then Jaffrey appears and tells Clifford their father wants to see him. Clifford learns that the sale is off. Gerald has a few securities left and Jaffrey has persuaded his father to let him invest the money. Clifford angrily says that the money will be lost and insists that the sale go ahead. The windows are open and passers-by hear the quarrel. Gerald tells Clifford that he is no longer his son and to get out. He picks up a paperweight to throw at Clifford but instead has a seizure. He collapses with blood dripping from his mouth. Jaffrey and Hepzibah rush in but it is too late. Jaffrey seizes his chance and calls Clifford a murderer because of the paperweight by Gerald's body, which has blood on it. Jaffrey is arrested and charged with murdering his father.Even though the evidence is circumstantial, Clifford is found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Hepzibah is preparing to leave Seven Gables when Mr. Barton, the family lawyer, drops by. Jaffrey is full of plans to tear the house down board by board, hoping to find hidden gold. He is shocked at the contents of his father's will. To avoid having the house seized by creditors, Gerald had earlier signed it over to Hepzibah. His life insurance will cover the debts and leave enough money for Hepzibah to live on. She begins laughing in a maniacal sort of way and throws Jaffrey out of the house.

    Synopsis
    The House of Seven Gables has been in the Pyncheon family for many generations. Colonel Jaffrey Pyncheon stole the land from Matthew Maule, who put a curse on the family. Colonel Pyncheon and many of his male descendants died by choking on their own blood during a sudden seizure.On a rainy night in 1828, the current Jaffrey Pyncheon arrives at Seven Gables. His father, Gerald, has summoned him from his legal practice in Boston. He is greeted by Hepzibah Pyncheon, a distant cousin who is engaged to his brother Clifford. When the family is assembled, Gerald gives Jaffrey the unwelcome news that Seven Gables is to be sold the next day. The family fortune is gone because of Gerald's poor management and he is deeply in debt. Clifford is in agreement that the house must be sold. He plans to use his share of the profits to marry Hepzibah and move to New York.After everyone is in bed, Jaffrey sneaks up to the attic. He opens an old trunk and rummages through the papers inside. Clifford catches him and asks what he is doing. Jaffrey is looking for a paper signed by King Charles II that gave the Pyncheon family a huge land grant in what is now Maine. Excitedly he tells Clifford that if he will change his mind and stand firm against the sale, they can search for the paper. If they find it, the government will have to reimburse them. But Clifford says that is just one of many legends about the family, including the one about half a million in gold hidden somewhere in the house. None of them are true.The next morning, Clifford avoids Jaffrey and his father. He and Hepzibah discuss their plans for the future. Then Jaffrey appears and tells Clifford their father wants to see him. Clifford learns that the sale is off. Gerald has a few securities left and Jaffrey has persuaded his father to let him invest the money. Clifford angrily says that the money will be lost and insists that the sale go ahead. The windows are open and passers-by hear the quarrel. Gerald tells Clifford that he is no longer his son and to get out. He picks up a paperweight to throw at Clifford but instead has a seizure. He collapses with blood dripping from his mouth. Jaffrey and Hepzibah rush in but it is too late. Jaffrey seizes his chance and calls Clifford a murderer because of the paperweight by Gerald's body, which has blood on it. Jaffrey is arrested and charged with murdering his father.Even though the evidence is circumstantial, Clifford is found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Hepzibah is preparing to leave Seven Gables when Mr. Barton, the family lawyer, drops by. Jaffrey is full of plans to tear the house down board by board, hoping to find hidden gold. He is shocked at the contents of his father's will. To avoid having the house seized by creditors, Gerald had earlier signed it over to Hepzibah. His life insurance will cover the debts and leave enough money for Hepzibah to live on. She begins laughing in a maniacal sort of way and throws Jaffrey out of the house. She then closes all the shutters and closes herself away from the world.Clifford and Hepzibah exchange letters for 20 years. She and Mr. Barton are trying to have his sentence commuted. Then a young man is put in Clifford's prison cell. He is a political activist who wants to abolish slavery.

                    Judy and Bubbles are two of the eight members of Madame Lydia Basilova's struggling New York City based dance troupe. Judy is largely seen as the class of the troupe, and is secretly Madame Basilova's favorite as Madame Basilova is a former ballerina, ballet for which Judy has natural talent despite most of their dance gigs being for cabarets and revues. As such, Judy has not developed her ballet technique. On the other hand, Bubbles, who has what Madame Basilova calls ""oomph"", is the one who attracts the most attention, especially from men looking for a fun time. Judy has a crisis of faith in her own abilities after she secretly watches Steve Adams' contemporary ballet company rehearse. Judy's experience in a burlesque show where Bubbles is now the solo headliner under the name Tiger Lily White makes Judy secretly long once again for a break in real dance. Although Bubbles may currently be one up professionally, Judy takes a step up personally when she catches the eye of one of the show's patrons, suave and gallant Jimmy Harris, who Bubbles believes is her man. What neither Judy or Bubbles initially knows is that Jimmy is also wealthy, but is dealing with some personal issues of his own. But Judy's life may be made all the more easy and to her liking if she would just speak to the nuisance of a man that seems to be following her everywhere.

He and Linda are happily married until a patroness of the arts convinces Esterbrook to forget about comedy and concentrate on writing a tragedy. The end result nearly destroys his career and his marriage.

                    Broadway star Linda Paige Esterbrook was largely responsible for her now playwright husband Gaylord Esterbrook's success. His first play, a comedy about Park Avenue high society, written when he was an innocent Midwesterner from Redfield, Minnesota, who had never stepped foot in New York City, was abandoned by its producer, Richard Benson, partly because Gay would not stray from his artistic vision despite the problems that Linda, the show's lead, Richard and director Morgan Carrell saw with certain aspects of it. With the theater already booked and paid for, Linda, who saw something special in the play and in Gay, convinced the rest of the cast and the crew, including less than enthusiastic Morgan, to work solely for a share of the profit. The resulting success of the play led to Linda and Gay falling in love and getting married. Their personal and professional union has led to three subsequent successes in three successive years, all of them comedies with Linda in the lead. Now a New York sophisticate with the temperament and attitude to match, Gay goes on drinking binges during his writing dry spells, which is currently the case. But things change for the Esterbrooks when, at a party, they meet the Swifts, industrialist Philo and his wife Amanda. Mandy sees her role in life as nurturing the ""latent possibilities"" in men, always in those that are already a success and never in those that are currently not so. Philo, who loves his wife for what she is, understands this of her and thus allows her her time with these other men, knowing that they are always short term, and that Mandy will always come back to him while she searches for her next ""victim"". Gay wants to write something more serious than the comedies he has been churning out, and turns to Mandy for that inspiration she provides. Linda sees Mandy as an idiot but not stupid, and as such Linda and Gay's marriage may not survive Mandy meddling in trying to make Gay something he's not, regardless of his want to be so, and not the man that Linda married.

                    After a former student discovers a rich deposit of radium in a South American rain forest, the brilliant but arrogant Dr. Alexander Thorkel sets up a laboratory there and begins experimenting on miniaturization of animals. When the pupil questions the scientists ethics, he callously murders him. Faced with failing eyesight, the mad doctor enlists three other scientists to help identify the roadblock that has delayed completion of his project. After a long and arduous journey by pack mule through the Andes, they arrive at the laboratory and quickly identify Thorkel's problem. Steve Baker, a miner and fourth member of their party, realizes the value of the radium and is reluctant to leave as are the scientists, who feel slighted by Thorkel's dismissive attitude and their concern about his now growing megalomania and paranoia. Feeling threatened by their curiosity concerning the true nature of his work, he miniaturizes them along with a native servant as they become his de facto guinea pigs. Although their situation appears grave, their one hope lies in Thorkel's Achilles heel, his failing eyesight.

                    During the Nazi uprising in 1939, they have captured prominent Czechoslovakian scientist Axel Bomasch and his adult daughter Anna Bomasch. Despite the senior Bomasch having escaped to England before the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, the Nazis were able to discover his hiding location in part due to an elaborate ruse using Anna, who at the time was imprisoned in a concentration camp, and Karl Marsen, a Gestapo officer posing as a fellow camp prisoner. Dickie Randall, an English officer using the code name Gus Bennett, decides to mount his own rescue of the Bomasches posing as a S.S. major. Anna feels she has no other choice but to go along with whatever Bennett tells her in an effort to escape from the Nazis, despite she not fully trusting him due to his seemingly cavalier attitude. Bennett and the Bomasch's ability to escape may be placed into jeopardy by two Englishmen traveling on the same night train to Munich.

From here we go back to flashback until the end.Prof. George Kingsley is teaching at Newcastle University. As class concludes, he announces that he may be taking a job at a major university next year. Jean Sovac (Anne Gwynne) talks to him and escorts him outside to a car driven by her father, Ernst, who is talking to Georges wife Margaret (Virginia Brissac) about her husbands interview with the university. They all go downtown where Kingsley asks to stop off for something forgotten. As he crosses the street, he is run down by two cars driven by gangsters Red Cannon (Stanley Ridges), Marnay (Bela Lugosi), Kane (Paul Fix), Devore (Raymond Bailey) and Miller (Edmund MacDonald) who are chasing each other. They crash into the building where George was going and he is knocked unconscious along with Cannon.At the hospital Dr. Sovac attends to both men. Kingsley has sustained brain damage while Cannon is paralyzed from the waist down. Sovac talks to Cannon, who promises to reward him if he helps him recover. Knowing that $500,000 is hidden somewhere by the gangster, Sovac agrees to help him. That night he performs a brain transplant: Cannons brain into Kingsleys body. When the police view the body of Cannon, now covered with a sheet, Dr. Sovac tells them the head wound along with a severed spine was the cause of death. Kingsley recovers.Sovac talks Kingsley into going to New York for a change of pace (Sovac is hoping to find out where the money is hidden so he can build his own clinic). They go to New York and check into the Midtown Hotel in the same suite Red Cannon used to hide out in. Kingsley seems to remember it but doesnt know why. Checking into the rooms, the bellhop remarks how the gangster formerly occupied this room and had a special knock which he used to wait on him. When Kingsley demonstrates this knock, the bellhop is surprised.They go to a nightclub where Cannons girlfriend, Sunny Rogers (Anne Nagel) is singing. When Kingsley gets a headache, they return to their rooms. Exhausted, Kingsley falls asleep. Sovac calls him Red Cannon until finally he responds. As Cannon, he takes on a different look and voice, remembering Sovac as the doctor who helped him. The doctor tells him he is now in the body of an English professor. Cannon looks himself over in a mirror, realizing that he will not be recognized. After strong-arming the bellhop, he escapes before Sovac realizes it. Next he is seen (in silhouette) strangling Devore. Later he returns to the hotel room by the fire escape and falls asleep on the bed. Sovac notices his bloody hands.Next morning the bellhop brings the freshly-laundered suit back to Sovac along with the morning paper, which states that Devore was killed. When Kingsley wakes up, Sovac mentions the killing to see his reaction. Later, as Kingsley is dressing, he hears a police siren and reverts to Cannon. He leaves by the fire escape. When there is no answer on the adjoining door, Sovac finds the door locked. He goes out in the hall to find Kingsleys door also locked. Getting in with the help of a maid, he finds the room empty.Sovac goes back to the nightclub and asks if Kingsley has been there. He is told that he was seen earlier but has left. At a table, Marnay, Kane and Miller discuss the murder. Marnay tells Kane to take care of Sunny as Red would. He enters her dressing room and presents her with a diamond-studded watch, promising it to her if she will meet them tonight at her apartment. Before Kane can do anything he is killed in his car by Cannon.That night, Sunny hears the familiar knock of Cannon and opens to find Kingsley who acts like Red and knows the secret bar and stash of weapons. He gives her the diamond watch which makes her nervous. The newspaper headline tells of the killing of Kane and the police discuss the case. They go to Marnays apartment where they find Cannon sitting at the desk. They are invited to wait for Marnay and ask who he is. He tells them he is Prof. Kingsley, whom they remember as the victim of the car crash involving Cannon. When they tell him to come down with them to the station, he shoots them both and escapes over the balcony. He is chased by more police over the rooftops and shot in the shoulder.Marnay and Miller enter Sunnys apartment, having given her the Cannon knock.

They promise to cut her in once the money is found.Dr. Sovac returns to the hotel, asking if Kingsley has been seen. When he goes to his room, he finds Margaret and Jean waiting (having already sent a telegram saying they were coming). He convinces them that Kingsley needed this trip and that Margaret was only spoiling him by waiting on him hand and foot. He tells them to return to Newcastle, saying they will come back when he is ready.When Cannon returns to his room, wounded, Sovac questions him and finds that he shot two cops after identifying himself as Kingsley. Sovac tells him he will be caught before the money is recovered. Suddenly Cannon knows Sovac knows about the money and threatens him. The doctor is able to convince him that he needs Sovac because otherwise he will revert to Kingsley permanently. He begins to dress the wound.Jean and Margaret discuss their suspicions and Jean says she will question her dad. Entering the room, she sees Cannon and calls out. Sovac takes her in the next room and confesses to the brain transplant. She tells him he has ruined his career and that they should return to Newcastle with them. He agrees and she leaves to tell Margaret.At the bar Cannon tells Sunny to pack so they can go to South America with the money. He is to return with it later and gets her car keys. In her dressing room she tells Marnay and Miller the plan. They agree to split the money three ways. She points him out as he is leaving the bar. They follow in their car. Cannon goes to a water reservoir and enters a door into a maintenance area that leads downstairs. Emerging from the door, Cannon carries a small metal box. He is confronted by Marnay and Miller who tell him to give up the box. When he tells them to come get it, Marnay approaches and a struggle ensues with Marnay thrown into the water. As he comes back up the stairs from the water, Marnay sneaks off with the box while Cannon struggles with Miller, killing him and dumping his body in the water.Sunny hears the knock on her door and opens up to find a wet Marnay who tells her the money split will now be two-way. He goes into the kitchen where she produces a screw driver to open the box. When a second knock comes, she tells Marnay to hide in the closet. He puts the box in the oven. Cannon enters and asks for Marnay. She tells him she hasnt seen him, but the wet tracks on the floor reveal that he is hiding in the closet. Locking the closet door, Marnay cries out to be released, telling Cannon where the money is. He gets the money and kills them both.Cannon hails a cab and tells the driver to take him to the airport. On the way he falls asleep and when they arrive, he wakes up as Kingsley, telling the driver to take him to the Midtown hotel.

The students crowd around but are upset as Cannon emerges and leaves.Sovac and his daughter are packing to leave when Cannon walks in, asking for him. He grabs Jean, demanding to see the doctor. She screams and calls for her dad. When Sovac comes in, he sees Cannon strangling his daughter. Forced to shoot, he kills Cannon, who falls and reverts back to Kingsley.

Sovac soon learns of the duel personality and of half a million dollars the gangster has hidden away. He attempts to find the money through the manipulation of his friend, an attempt that brings Kingsley closer to madness as he alternates between a meek professor of English and a brutal gangster out for murderous revenge on those who tried to kill him.

                    Lars Rockne and his family, including his four year old son Knute, emigrate to Chicago in 1892 from their native Norway. By his mid-twenties Knute saves enough to attend obscure Notre Dame University, where he excels in football and chemistry. He and a teammate develop the forward pass as an offensive weapon while working as life guards on summer break and use it to upset heavily favored Army in a historic game. After graduation Rockne becomes a teacher while coaching part-time but ultimately abandons academics to devote all his energies to football. During his tenure as head coach at the school, he develops such outstanding players as George Gipp, who dies prematurely from a strep infection, and the Four Horseman while introducing many innovative tactics including the backfield shift. Rockne, known for his staccato motivational speeches, devotes his life to maintaining the integrity of the sport he loves and promoting it as an integral component in the development of the American character.

                    Biopic of the famed Notre Dame football coach. Knute immigrated to the United with his parents and after working as a mail sorter for several years, he saved enough money to attend Notre Dame. He was a good student and athlete and did well enough in chemistry to be asked to participate in one of the professor's lab studies for a summer. He and a teammate perfected the forward pass, something that had not often been used in football to that point. Knute accepts a position as an instructor but he's also coaching the football team, which becomes his full-time job. His innovations make Notre Dame one of the premier football powers of the 1920s. Knute Rockne died in a plane crash on March 31, 1831.

                    ""The Fighting 69th"" is a First World War regiment of mostly New York-Irish soldiers. Amongst a cocky crew, perhaps the cockiest is Jerry Plunkett, a scrappy fellow who looks out only for himself. The officers and non-coms of the regiment do their best to instill discipline in Plunkett, and the chaplain, Father Duffy, tries to make Plunkett see the greater good, all to no avail. Behind the lines or in the trenches, Plunkett acts selfishly and cowardly, eventually costing the lives of many of his fellow soldiers. A final act of cowardice leads to terrible consequences, but Plunkett sees in them a chance to redeem himself...if only he can.

                    Texas Ranger Dusty Rivers (""Isn't that a contradiction in terms?"", another character asks him) travels to Canada in the 1880s in search of Jacques Corbeau, who is wanted for murder. He wanders into the midst of the Riel Rebellion, in which Métis (people of French and Native heritage) and Natives want a separate nation. Dusty falls for nurse April Logan, who is also loved by Mountie Jim Brett. April's brother is involved with Courbeau's daughter Louvette, which leads to trouble during the battles between the rebels and the Mounties. Through it all Dusty is determined to bring Corbeau back to Texas (and April, too, if he can manage it.)

The four decide to forgo their college careers when they are hired by the wealthy Harvey Casey to be the around-the-clock unknown bodyguards of his fast living, mean-spirited and spoiled daughter, Consuelo 'Connie' Casey. Their job is more to see that she stays out of trouble. They only agree after spying the pretty Connie and despite having a no-romance clause in their contract. Upon her arrival back in the United States after finishing school in Italy, Connie throws them all for a loop when she announces that she has changed her fast living ways and plans on attending Pottawatomie College, a third rate institution in New Mexico. Mr. Casey can't argue as it is his alma mater, which he attended before he became rich. Mr. Casey suspects she has ulterior motives for wanting to attend Pottawatomie - a man - which is indeed the case. While Jojo, Al and Manuelito don't mind the no-romance clause since Pottawatomie has a 10:1 ratio of girls to boys, Clint soon falls in love with Connie, and she with him. Meanwhile, the four boys decide to play for the school's football team. The school's hapless football teams have not scored a touchdown in over twenty years. The budding romance between Connie and Clint and what looks to be the new found success of Pottawatomie's football team may be put into jeopardy if Connie finds out the real reason Clint is at Pottawatomie.

                    Susan Trexel is a wealthy socialite, who while vacationing in Europe undergoes a religious transformation. On her return to America, Susan takes on the task of spreading her new found religious experience with her closest friends - only to drive them crazy.

                    Wealthy New Yorkers Barrie and Susan Trexel's marriage has long now been in name only. Self-absorbed Susan's disregard of her family has led to Barrie's drinking. They never see their now teenaged daughter, Blossom, who is shuttled between boarding school and summer camp. With no parental guidance, Blossom has become a slightly awkward young woman. Barrie and Susan's mutual friends side largely with Susan if only because they don't like to be around Barrie when he's drunk, which is all the time. The only exception among their friends is Charlotte, who secretly feels compassion for Barrie. While Susan is away on vacation in Europe, Barrie decides to sober up for the sake of his family, which includes reuniting with Blossom, who he learns wants more than anything for them to become a real nuclear family. Returning from Europe, Susan does whatever she can to avoid Barrie by hiding out at their friend Irene's house - where many of their mutual friends have convened - while advancing her latest ""cause"". She has found God and is a follower of a new religious movement that tries to expose the truth in God's name, which she does with her group of friends. Barrie does eventually catch up with her, and partly using her new-found relationship with God against her, negotiates them spending the entire summer together at their closed up country house with Blossom, much for Blossom's sake. Among the stipulations are that Barrie will grant her an immediate divorce if he falls off the wagon, and on her doing that sex will not be part of the arrangement. As the summer progresses, both Barrie and Susan may come to a better understanding of what they each need, both for themselves and out of a relationship.

When Bill unexpectedly returns from the island where he was marooned, what is Vicky to do?

                    Bill Cardew and Henry Lowndes were business partners and best friends up until Bill's supposed death when he drowned on one of his adventure vacations. A year after Bill's death, Henry has decided to take Bill's name off their business partnership, which irks Henry's wife, Vicky Lowndes, as Vicky is the widowed former Mrs. Bill Cardew. Vicky loved Bill during their marriage, and loves Henry now in their marriage, but in both, has felt slightly neglected, playing second fiddle to Bill's adventure vacations and Henry's focus on the business. Life for the Lowndeses hits some complications when Bill returns home, he who obviously did not drown on his adventure vacation, but was marooned on a deserted island for a year. Bill expects to return to his former life with Vicky, but it is not as simple as he being Vicky's first husband. Both men love Vicky, and Vicky loves both men. But before she can decide with who she wants to spend her life - if she can indeed decide - she relishes in the fact that her husbands are paying her more attention now than they ever have.

                    The boyfriend (Cantinflas) of the servant of a rich industrial man, gets into the house in order to kill a mad dog. Suddenly this man appears so the servant tells him that Cantinflas is his wife's brother (Leonardo), who had been lost for years. The rich man then remembers that his father in law's testament could only be paid when all brothers get together, so treats Cantinflas, a real bum, as a king.

                    Shipping magnate Cyrus Wentworth, downcast over a disaster to his ocean liner 'Wentworth Castle' (carrying, oddly enough, an illicit shipment of Chinese bonds) is shot in his office...at the very moment of kicking out his daughter's fiance Dick Fleming. Of course, Captain Street arrests Dick, but reporter Bobbie Logan, the attractive thorn in Street's side, is so convinced he's wrong that she enlists the help of detective James Lee Wong to find the real killer.

A million and a half dollars in bonds was taken from one of Cyrus P. Wentworth's ship before it was mysteriously sunk and, shortly afterward, Wentworth was found murdered. The police, led by Detective Captain Bill Street, suspect Dick Fleming, fiancée of Wentworth's daughter Cynthia.
