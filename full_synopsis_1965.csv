                    In 1930's Austria, a young woman named Maria is failing miserably in her attempts to become a nun. When the Navy captain Georg Von Trapp writes to the convent asking for a governess that can handle his seven mischievous children, Maria is given the job. The Captain's wife is dead, and he is often away, and runs the household as strictly as he does the ships he sails on. The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that their father keeps hiring, and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives, she is initially met with the same hostility, but her kindness, understanding, and sense of fun soon draws them to her and brings some much-needed joy into all their lives -- including the Captain's. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love, even though Georg is already engaged to a Baroness and Maria is still a postulant. The romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made. Their personal conflicts soon become overshadowed, however, by world events. Austria is about to come under the control of Germany, and the Captain may soon find himself drafted into the German navy and forced to fight against his own country.

                    In London, Belgian immigrant Carol Ledoux shares an apartment with her older sister Helen, and works as a manicurist at a beauty salon. Helen uses the word ""sensitive"" to describe Carol's overall demeanor, which is almost like she walks around in a daze, rarely speaking up about anything. When she does speak up, it generally is about something against one of those few issues on which she obsesses, such as Helen's boyfriend Michael's invasion of her space at the apartment. That specific issue may be more about men in general than just Michael's actions, as witnessed by Carol being agitated by hearing Helen and Michael's lovemaking, and she not being able to rebuff the advances effectively of a male suitor, Colin, who is infatuated with her. One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them. While Helen and Michael leave on a vacation to Pisa, Italy, Carol chooses largely to lock herself in the apartment, ditching work. There, she is almost hypnotized by her solitude, which leads to her mental state deteriorating as those obsessions come to the fore. She quickly descends into madness, which ultimately also affects those that are trying to get in touch with her.

There are eight guests and two servants there for the weekend, but one by one, they are being knocked off according to the poem of ""Ten Little Indians"".

Those eight are Dr. Edward Armstrong, actress Ilona Bergen, private detective William Blore, Judge Arthur Cannon, Owen's new assistant Ann Clyde, engineer Hugh Lombard, General John Mandrake and pop singer Mike Raven. Even Ann and the two housekeepers, husband and wife Joseph and Elsa Grohmann, have never met Owen. Upon their arrival, Owen is nowhere to be seen. However, he leaves them a tape recorded message stating that each of them, including the Grohmanns, is responsible for the death of an innocent person or has caused murder. All around the mansion are references to the nursery rhyme Ten Little Indians, including a miniature statuary of ten little Indians. After one of the guests dies from arsenic poisoning, he who admitted before his death his guilt in the incident mentioned on the tape, one of the Indians from the statuary goes missing. The remaining nine guests, who are stranded for at least two days since the gondola has broken down for the weekend, know that Owen's mission is to kill them all, a missing Indian on the statuary a sign that yet another one of the ten has died. As they search the mansion and find no trace of anyone else, they come to the realization that Owen is one of them. This discovery leads to suspicion of the others as Owen as they try to evade Owen's planned end for them. But as one by one the guests are killed, it narrows down the one who is Owen.

It is night and this man is there on personal business: He is looking for his niece. Somehow, in the past decade, he has managed to find her, or at least someone who appears to be the daughter of his half brother.The would-be niece is skeptical, and afraid. General Yevgraf Zhivago tells her the details of the life of his half brother as he knows it. This is the movie.Yuri Zhivago is a boy, only 8 years old, when his mother dies, somewhere in central Asia, not far from Mongolia. Yuri is adopted by very close friends of his mother, the Gromykos, an upper class family with a home in Moscow and a country estate near the Ural Mountains. The Gromykos have a daughter, Tonya, who is the same age as Yuri.Yuri, now a young man, becomes a doctor, preferring to see ""life"" in General Practice rather than be a researcher. He is also an accomplished and published poet. Late one winter evening, a lonely group of socialist demonstrators is slaughtered by a Czar Cavalry Unit. Yuri witnesses the entire event from his balcony and attempts to care for the wounded. He is forced back into his home by the soldiers. He is shaken by the event.The following winter, at a music recital, Yuri's mentor is summoned to treat a woman who has attempted suicide, possibly by drinking Iodine. Yuri accompanies his mentor and sees ""life"" first hand. It is at this woman's home where he first sees Lara, the daughter of the woman. He is smitten. Shortly thereafter, at a Christmas party, the engagement announcement of Yuri and Tonya is interrupted by Lara shooting Komarovsky, Lara's sometime lover and companion. Komarovsky is only slightly wounded and Lara is escorted out of the party by her fiancé, Pasha.World War I erupts and Yuri is posted to a field unit far to southwest near Ukraine. Lara is a volunteer nurse in the same area. Her husband (Pasha), disappears during a battle, and is presumed dead. As the summer of 1917 ends, the October Russian Revolution occurs, changing the entire political landscape. World War I for the Russians had begun to wind down the previous summer, ending in the winter. Yuri and Lara, having worked together in an old country estate converted to a hospital, are the last to leave the now empty facility. They are clearly in love with each other, but have managed to keep their passions suppressed.Yuri returns to his Moscow home to find his step-mother deceased, and his home (his step father's home) occupied by 13 additional families. The Bolsheviks are now in full control of the large cities, and collectivization has begun. But Moscow is in trouble; with virtually no food supplies or heating fuel (wood), the impending Russian winter will be deadly. One night, Yuri decides to steal some fence boards that can be burned. He is observed by Yevgraf (now a policeman and party official) and is followed home. Yevgraf knows this man is his half brother and rather than arrest Yuri, the two connect for the first time. But the works of Yuri Zhivago, the published poet, has fallen out of favor with the authorities putting the lives of Yuri, his wife Tonya, his son Shasha, and his step-father Alexander, in danger. Yevgraf arranges all the necessary travel papers and the family of 4 departs Moscow eastbound in a crowed boxcar. Their destination is Yuriatin, the small town near the family's country estate at Varykino.Enroute, the train stops due to civil war activity in the area. Yuri wanders away from his train, only to stumble into the military train of a communist general. The general turns out to be the husband of Lara, Pasha. But Pasha has taken on a new name, People's Commander Strelnikov. He has become a renegade, and uses his army to fight the remaining White Russians however he can. Strelnikov and Zhivago discover they have seen each other before, at the party where Komarovsky was shot. Suspicions that Yuri is an assassin or spy are determined to be groundless and Strelnikov uncharacteristically releases Yuri. Yuri and family reach their distant estate.It is early spring. The main house has been sealed by the local communist authorities, but the gardener's cottage remains available. The family gets the vegetable garden back in shape, and settles in for what is expected to be a multi-year stay. The family thrives, and remains in the cottage, living almost invisibly. That summer, the czar and his family are executed. The family remains in the cottage through the winter.Finally, the next summer, Yuri takes the short trip into Yuriatin. Lara has lived in Yuriatin for about a year, having returned there in search of her husband, Pasha (Strelnikov). Yuri and Lara meet in the local library, and an affair between the two begins. But Yuri cannot live with the conflict of the affair. His pregnant wife loves him deeply, and so does Lara. Yuri rides into Yuriatin to break off the affair.On the way home, Yuri is kidnapped by a Red Partisan unit and is drafted to be their medical officer. A year and a half later, in the dead of winter, Yuri wanders away from the Red Guard Unit, deserting. Yuri makes his way back to Yuriatin, discovering that his family has left Varykino for Moscow. He goes to the only other place he knows, Lara's small apartment. Starving and nearly dead, Lara brings him back to health. Lara gives Yuri a letter from Tonya, addressed to him care of Lara. The letter is dated 6 months earlier. Tonya had known of Yuri's affair, and Tonya and Lara had met. Yuri's family has escaped back to Moscow, and is being deported from Russia. Shortly thereafter, Komarovsky unexpectedly appears at Lara's apartment. He brings news that Lara's husband Strelnikov is ""gone"", Yuri is considered a deserter, and their days are numbered. Komarovsky offers help by way of transportation to the far east of Russia, Vladavastok, from which they can go anywhere in the world. Lara and Yuri refuse the offer, but know Komarovsky is right, their days are numbered.Lara and Yuri move themselves to Varykino, and occupy a small portion of the main house. They stay there through most of the remaining winter. Again, Komarovsky finds them and tells them that Strelnikov has been arrested just 5 miles from Varykino. Lara and Yuri must now move quickly to survive. They accept Komarovsky's offer of protection and transportation to Manchuria, and leave Varykino immediately. But Yuri remains behind, ostensibly to bring his own sledge to the train station. Lara and Komarovsky wait for Yuri on the train at the Yuriatin train station, but Yuri does not arrive. The train leaves, and Lara announces to Komarovsky that she is pregnant with Yuri's child.Eight years pass. Yuri is found in Moscow by Yevgraf, in poor health, malnourished and jobless. Yevgraf arranges for Yuri to get his old job back at the hospital and sees him off at the street car stop on his first day. On the ride, Yuri thinks he sees Lara walking in the direction of the street car. He attempts to get off the car, succeeds and collapses in the street. He dies of a heart attack.At the memorial, huge numbers of people pay their respects, much to Yevgraf's amazement. One of those people is Lara, and Lara is searching for her daughter Tonya, lost somewhere near Mongolia during the far east civil war. Yevgraf and Lara search Moscow's orphanages, but Tonya is not found. Speaking of Lara, Yevgraf narrates: ""One day she went away and didn't come back. She died or vanished somewhere in one of the labor camps; a nameless number on a list that was after-wards...mislaid. That was quite common in those days.""The story his been told, and the scene returns to the project office. Although Tonya, now a young woman of about 18, wants to believe who were her parents, but only if the fact is true. Morning has come, and Yevgraf makes a final request, that Tonya think about establishing with Yevgraf a family relationship. Neither have any relatives, and Tonya promises to think about it.Tonya and Yevgraf part on what promises to be a beautiful day.","

    Synopsis
    	A high ranking Russian General has arrived at an industrial project office. It is night and this man is there on personal business: He is looking for his niece. Somehow, in the past decade, he has managed to find her, or at least someone who appears to be the daughter of his half brother
.
The would-be niece is skeptical, and afraid. General Yevgraf Zhivago tells her the details of the life of his half brother as he knows it. This is the movie.Yuri Zhivago is a boy, only 8 years old, when his mother dies, somewhere in central Asia, not far from Mongolia. Yuri is adopted by very close friends of his mother, the Gromykos, an upper class family with a home in Moscow and a country estate near the Ural Mountains. The Gromykos have a daughter, Tonya, who is the same age as Yuri.Yuri, now a young man, becomes a doctor, preferring to see ""life"" in General Practice rather than be a researcher. He is also an accomplished and published poet. Late one winter evening, a lonely group of socialist demonstrators is slaughtered by a Czar Cavalry Unit. Yuri witnesses the entire event from his balcony and attempts to care for the wounded. He is forced back into his home by the soldiers. He is shaken by the event.The following winter, at a music recital, Yuri's mentor is summoned to treat a woman who has attempted suicide, possibly by drinking Iodine. Yuri accompanies his mentor and sees ""life"" first hand. It is at this woman's home where he first sees Lara, the daughter of the woman. He is smitten. Shortly thereafter, at a Christmas party, the engagement announcement of Yuri and Tonya is interrupted by Lara shooting Komarovsky, Lara's sometime lover and companion. Komarovsky is only slightly wounded and Lara is escorted out of the party by her fiancé, Pasha.World War I erupts and Yuri is posted to a field unit far to southwest near Ukraine. Lara is a volunteer nurse in the same area. Her husband (Pasha), disappears during a battle, and is presumed dead. As the summer of 1917 ends, the October Russian Revolution occurs, changing the entire political landscape. World War I for the Russians had begun to wind down the previous summer, ending in the winter. Yuri and Lara, having worked together in an old country estate converted to a hospital, are the last to leave the now empty facility. They are clearly in love with each other, but have managed to keep their passions suppressed.Yuri returns to his Moscow home to find his step-mother deceased, and his home (his step father's home) occupied by 13 additional families. The Bolsheviks are now in full control of the large cities, and collectivization has begun. But Moscow is in trouble; with virtually no food supplies or heating fuel (wood), the impending Russian winter will be deadly. One night, Yuri decides to steal some fence boards that can be burned. He is observed by Yevgraf (now a policeman and party official) and is followed home. Yevgraf knows this man is his half brother and rather than arrest Yuri, the two connect for the first time. But the works of Yuri Zhivago, the published poet, has fallen out of favor with the authorities putting the lives of Yuri, his wife Tonya, his son Shasha, and his step-father Alexander, in danger. Yevgraf arranges all the necessary travel papers and the family of 4 departs Moscow eastbound in a crowed boxcar. Their destination is Yuriatin, the small town near the family's country estate at Varykino.Enroute, the train stops due to civil war activity in the area. Yuri wanders away from his train, only to stumble into the military train of a communist general. The general turns out to be the husband of Lara, Pasha. But Pasha has taken on a new name, People's Commander Strelnikov. He has become a renegade, and uses his army to fight the remaining White Russians however he can. Strelnikov and Zhivago discover they have seen each other before, at the party where Komarovsky was shot. Suspicions that Yuri is an assassin or spy are determined to be groundless and Strelnikov uncharacteristically releases Yuri. Yuri and family reach their distant estate.It is early spring. The main house has been sealed by the local communist authorities, but the gardener's cottage remains available. The family gets the vegetable garden back in shape, and settles in for what is expected to be a multi-year stay. The family thrives, and remains in the cottage, living almost invisibly. That summer, the czar and his family are executed. The family remains in the cottage through the winter.Finally, the next summer, Yuri takes the short trip into Yuriatin. Lara has lived in Yuriatin for about a year, having returned there in search of her husband, Pasha (Strelnikov). Yuri and Lara meet in the local library, and an affair between the two begins. But Yuri cannot live with the conflict of the affair. His pregnant wife loves him deeply, and so does Lara. Yuri rides into Yuriatin to break off the affair.On the way home, Yuri is kidnapped by a Red Partisan unit and is drafted to be their medical officer. A year and a half later, in the dead of winter, Yuri wanders away from the Red Guard Unit, deserting. Yuri makes his way back to Yuriatin, discovering that his family has left Varykino for Moscow. He goes to the only other place he knows, Lara's small apartment. Starving and nearly dead, Lara brings him back to health. Lara gives Yuri a letter from Tonya, addressed to him care of Lara. The letter is dated 6 months earlier. Tonya had known of Yuri's affair, and Tonya and Lara had met. Yuri's family has escaped back to Moscow, and is being deported from Russia. Shortly thereafter, Komarovsky unexpectedly appears at Lara's apartment. He brings news that Lara's husband Strelnikov is ""gone"", Yuri is considered a deserter, and their days are numbered. Komarovsky offers help by way of transportation to the far east of Russia, Vladavastok, from which they can go anywhere in the world. Lara and Yuri refuse the offer, but know Komarovsky is right, their days are numbered.Lara and Yuri move themselves to Varykino, and occupy a small portion of the main house. They stay there through most of the remaining winter. Again, Komarovsky finds them and tells them that Strelnikov has been arrested just 5 miles from Varykino. Lara and Yuri must now move quickly to survive. They accept Komarovsky's offer of protection and transportation to Manchuria, and leave Varykino immediately. But Yuri remains behind, ostensibly to bring his own sledge to the train station. Lara and Komarovsky wait for Yuri on the train at the Yuriatin train station, but Yuri does not arrive. The train leaves, and Lara announces to Komarovsky that she is pregnant with Yuri's child.Eight years pass. Yuri is found in Moscow by Yevgraf, in poor health, malnourished and jobless. Yevgraf arranges for Yuri to get his old job back at the hospital and sees him off at the street car stop on his first day. On the ride, Yuri thinks he sees Lara walking in the direction of the street car. He attempts to get off the car, succeeds and collapses in the street. He dies of a heart attack.At the memorial, huge numbers of people pay their respects, much to Yevgraf's amazement. One of those people is Lara, and Lara is searching for her daughter Tonya, lost somewhere near Mongolia during the far east civil war. Yevgraf and Lara search Moscow's orphanages, but Tonya is not found. Speaking of Lara, Yevgraf narrates: ""One day she went away and didn't come back. She died or vanished somewhere in one of the labor camps; a nameless number on a list that was after-wards...mislaid. That was quite common in those days.""The story his been told, and the scene returns to the project office. Although Tonya, now a young woman of about 18, wants to believe who were her parents, but only if the fact is true. Morning has come, and Yevgraf makes a final request, that Tonya think about establishing with Yevgraf a family relationship. Neither have any relatives, and Tonya promises to think about it.Tonya and Yevgraf part on what promises to be a beautiful day.

He rides on his horse to the town's brothel where he confronts, chases and shoots down a wanted criminal, collecting a bounty of $1,000 on Guy Calloway (José Terrón). Mortimer's gunslinging skill is displayed as he easily kills him from long distance. After collecting the bounty he inquires about Red ""Baby"" Cavanagh (José Marco), who has a $2,000 bounty, and was last seen in White Rocks. Mortimer is told that Cavanagh has already been targeted a stranger, who is referred to as ""Monco"" (meaning one-handed in Spanish - and Italian). We first see Monco (Clint Eastwood) ride into town and track down Cavanagh at a saloon playing five-card draw poker. Monco kills him and his men, and takes the bounty.Elsewhere, a Mexican bandit named Indio (Gian Maria Volonté) is serving a jail sentence but his gang arrive and kill several guards to free their leader. Indio escapes and more guards are killed but Indio spares the life of one so that he can let people know what he and his men are capable of.Soon, Indio gets hold of the bounty hunter responsible for putting him behind bars. He has the man's wife and child killed and challenges him to an unfair duel. Indio takes his life.Indio is a ruthless, intelligent man. He has a musical pocketwatch that he plays before engaging in gun duels. ""When the chimes finish, begin,"" he says. Flashbacks reveal that the watch originates from a young woman (Rosemary Dexter), who killed herself while being raped by Indio after he had found her with her lover and killed him. The watch bears a photo of the woman and was presented as a gift by the young man before being killed.Having learned of Indio's manhunt and reward money, Monco arrives in the town of El Paso and soon crosses paths with Mortimer. Both men believe Indio will rob the town's bank - the Texan equivalent of Fort Knox, that holds a safe containing ""almost a million dollars"". The two hunters' theory is confirmed when several of Indio's men arrive to stake out the town and Mortimer tries to goad one of the gunmen, The Hunchback Wild (Klaus Kinski) into a fight but he refuses in order to keep out of trouble.From different sources, Monco and Mortimer find out that the other is a bounty killer and are obviously chasing the same purpose. Monco tries to get Mortimer out of town by proving his gun skills by shooting at the Colonel's hat. But Mortimer proves his own worth and does exactly the same thing to Manco. Realizing they each have skills that would be ideal against fourteen men,and in order to ""get Indio between two fires"" they reluctantly form a partnership and decide that Monco should go undercover with the outlaws. He rescues one of Indio's friends from prison and is quickly offered membership into the gang.Indio sends Monco with a few of his men to rob the bank of Santa Cruz in order to be decoys and get the sheriff and his men away from El Paso. Monco kills the men he is sent with and arrives in El Paso to bring Indio down with Mortimer but the plan goes wrong and the gang successfully rob the bank and take off with the loot. Monco tries to sever his ties with Mortimer but Mortimer convinces him otherwise.However when Monco joins back up with Indio, he convinces him to go in the opposite direction to what the Colonel planned.The gang arrive in the small border town of Agua Caliente, where Monco is surprised to find Mortimer waiting for him. The hunchback recognizes the Colonel from their previous encounter and forces a showdown in which he is killed by the Colonel. The Colonel then proves his worth to Indio by cracking open the safe without using explosives, but Indio states his intention to wait a month if necessary to allow the furor over the bank robbery to die down and locks the money away in a chest in the treasure room.That night, Monco and the Colonel meet in the treasure room and plan to steal the bank money from Indio. The Colonel had already taken the money out of the chest earlier and now locks it again with his special ability to open and lock locks without keys. When they leave the treasure room by roof (because the door is locked) they realize that the bandits are outside waiting for them, knowing that Monco is actually a bounty killer and that the Colonel is his cooperator. Just before Monco jumps down, he throws the bag with the money in a tree unnoticed. When Monco and the Colonel have climbed down, Indio's band severely beat them. Afterwards, Indio finds out that chest is still locked, which makes him believe that Monco and the Colonel never stole the money.Later that night, Indio's right-hand man Nino (Mario Brega), on orders from Indio, kills the guard of Monco and the Colonel and releases them. Indio informs his gang that they ""got away,"" and sends them after the escaped bounty hunters. He intends to kill off his gang with the bounty killers while he and Nino take all the loot for themselves. However, the smarter Groggy (Luigi Pistilli) figures out what Indio is up to, and kills Nino. Before he can kill Indio, he finds that the Colonel has already removed the stolen money from the chest. Indio convinces Groggy to join forces with him to trap the bounty-killers.The next morning, Monco and Mortimer shoot down the gang, one by one, in the streets of the town.

                    When two colleagues of James Bond are murdered, James follows the widow of a double agent who has been killed - and a confrontation ensues. The double agent is part of SPECTRE, and the organization's meeting in a secret lair in Paris regrets the agent's passing as it deals with new criminal business. Emilio Largo, a ruthless and flamboyant one-eyed enforcer, has hatched a scheme against the North Atlantic Treaty powers that begins at a rehabilitation clinic near an RAF airbase. Scheduled to pilot an RAF Vulcan strategic bomber on a normal ""fail-safe"" flight is Francois Derval, who is having a passionate affair with the magnificently endowed beauty Fiona Volpe - an affair that SPECTRE exploits. Soon, the Vulcan and its warload of two nuclear bombs has been hijacked, the bombs seized by Largo, for use in SPECTRE's most audacious extortion scheme yet. James Bond, however, finds a key clue in the sister of Francois Derval, Dominique ""Domino"" Derval, a beautiful young woman who is a passionate scuba-diver living in Nassau. When James investigates Domino, he comes into contact with a SPECTRE operation on the island, and he gets help from HMSS' man in Nassau, Pinder, and in old CIA chum Felix Leiter. But when James and Felix find out what SPECTRE is up to, it may be to late to save a major US coastal city from nuclear annihilation.

    Synopsis
    James Bond (Sean Connery) attends the funeral of Colonel Jacques Bouvar, a SPECTRE operative (Number 6).[6] Bouvar is alive and disguised, but Bond identifies him. Following him to a château, Bond fights and kills him, escaping using a jetpack and his Aston Martin DB5.Bond is sent by M to a clinic to improve his health. While massaged by physiotherapist Patricia Fearing (Molly Peters), he meets Count Lippe (Guy Doleman), a suspicious man with a criminal tattoo (from a Tong). He searches Lippe's room, but is seen leaving by Lippe's clinic neighbour who is bandaged after plastic surgery. Lippe tries to murder Bond with a spinal traction machine, but is foiled by Fearing, whom Bond then seduces. (Bond later gets his revenge on Lippe by locking him in a steam unit.) Meanwhile, François Derval (Paul Stassino), a French NATO pilot, relaxes with a beautiful woman, Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) when he receives a call to report for a training flight aboard a Avro Vulcan stealth bomber. When he answers the door expecting his driver, he is instantly killed by Angelo, a SPECTRE henchman surgically altered to match his appearance. Volpe is also a SPECTRE agent, responsible for replacing Derval with Angelo. At the last minute, Angelo demands more money to complete his mission. Volpe agrees and sends him out. The Vulcan that Derval was meant to fly on will be employed on a top secret mission with two British nuclear bombs aboard. Late in the flight, Angelo kills the crew with nerve gas and deliberately sinks the Vulcan near the Bahamas. He is then killed by Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi) (SPECTRE No. 2) for trying to extort more money. Largo and his henchmen retrieve the stolen atomic bombs from the seabed. All British double-0 agents are called to Whitehall and en route, Lippe chases Bond. Lippe is killed by SPECTRE agent Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) for failing to foresee Angelo's greed. SPECTRE demands £100 million in white flawless diamonds from NATO in exchange for returning the bombs. If their demands are not met, SPECTRE will destroy a major city in the United States or the United Kingdom. At the meeting, Bond recognises Derval from a photograph in the file. Since Derval's sister, Domino (Claudine Auger), is in Nassau, Bond asks M (Bernard Lee) to send him there, where he discovers Domino is Largo's mistress.Bond takes a boat to where Domino is snorkeling. After saving her life, the two have lunch together. Later, Bond goes to a party, where he sees Largo and Domino gambling. Bond enters the game against Largo, and wins. Bond and Domino leave the game and dance together. Bond returns to the Hotel, uses a secret corridor to enter his room, and notices someone is also inside. Felix Leiter (Rik Van Nutter) enters and is silenced by Bond, who finds and disarms a SPECTRE henchman in the bathroom. He releases the henchman, who returns to Largo's estate, Palmyra. When he arrives, Largo immediately has him thrown into a pool where he keeps man-eating sharks. Bond meets Q, and is issued with a collection of gadgets, including an underwater infrared camera, a distress beacon, a mini-rebreather, a flare gun and a Geiger counter.Bond attempts to scuba under Largo's boat and finds that her keel is of an unusual design. When he's discovered, Largo's men throw grenades overboard to kill him. Bond is forced to retreat. Meanwhile, Bond's assistant Paula (Martine Beswick) is abducted by Largo for questioning and kills herself with a hidden cyanide capsule. Bond returns to his hotel room and finds Fiona waiting for him. The two spend the evening in bed. As they prepare to leave for the local Junkanoo celebration, Fiona's thugs enter and force Bond to a waiting car. Bond escapes into the Junkanoo and enters the Kiss Kiss Club. Fiona finds and attempts to kill him, but is shot by her own bodyguard.Bond meets up with Leiter and the two search for the Vulcan, finding it underwater in Golden Grotto, a reef known for it's tiger sharks. He finds Angelo's body and takes his dog tags and watch. Bond later meets Domino scuba-diving and removes a sea urchin spine from her foot. Bond tells her that Largo killed her brother, showing her the tags and watch. He asks her for help finding the bombs. She tells him to replace a henchman on Largo's mission to retrieve them. Bond gives her his Geiger counter, asking her to look for them on Largo's ship. She is discovered and captured. Disguised as Largo's henchman, Bond uncovers his plan to destroy Miami Beach.Bond is discovered and locked in the underwater cave where Largo had hidden the bombs. He is rescued by Leiter, who orders United States Coast Guard sailors to parachute to the area. After an underwater battle, the henchmen surrender.Largo escapes to his ship, the Disco Volante, which carries one bomb. Largo attempts to escape by jettisoning the rear of the ship. The front section, a hydrofoil, escapes. Bond boards the Disco and battles with Largo; Largo is about to shoot him when Domino, freed by Ladislav Kutze, shoots Largo with a harpoon. Bond and Domino jump overboard, the boat runs aground and explodes. A sky hook-equipped U.S. Navy airplane rescues them.

                    August, 1943. Colonel Joseph Ryan of the US Army Air Forces is shot down in Italy and taken to a prison camp populated by the Royal Army's 9th Fusiliers and run by sadistic commandant Battaglia. With the recent passing of their commanding colonel, the 9th Fusiliers under Major Eric Fincham must now answer to the new senior officer of the prisoners, Ryan. Also in the camp are several American prisoners who don't cotton to Major Fincham's stubborn passive resistance to Battaglia, passive resistance that has led to denial of clean clothes, soap, running water, and decent food. When two of the Americans are ""arrested"" by Fincham for trying to steal medicines being horded for escape attempts, Ryan points out the varied tunnels being built by Fincham's men to Battaglia in exchange for necessities, but is double-crossed by Battaglia. Ryan then fights back with an audacious order, which embarasses Battaglia and sends Ryan to a sweatbox to die. But Italy surrenders a few days later and Battaglia is taken prisoner and put to trial in which he will be executed, even though with Italy out of the war he is now a civilian. Ryan disbands the trial and has Battaglia placed in the sweatbox, but a German overflight forces the battalion to flee for safety. After a day-night march, the escaped prisoners and trapped by German forces and herded onto a train, but not before their betrayer can stand and gloat at his victory, and earn Ryan seemingly permanent hatred by the British soldiers. Ryan, however, is not finished, and orchestrates an even more daring escape, seizing the train. But with German forces all around, and after escaping a bombing raid by British Lancasters, they must drive the train further north to escape the Germans and try for the only safe haven to be found.

[ by bj_kuehl]--------------------------KrystelClaire's synopsis:We begin with the 7:55 train for Bradley. Five very different gentlemen coincide in a coach. One of them is a weirdly mysterious tarot reader Dr Shreck (Peter Cushing), who seems to be checking his company. The initials in his briefcase read W. R. S.. Its contents fall to the floor, and Dr Bob Carroll (Donald Sutherland) wonders at the strange cards. Dr Shreck is a doctor in Metaphysics, and his surname means ""terror"", so he is the Dr Terror of the title. He says that he sometimes predicts horrible things, although he's an amiable person. These tarot cards predict the natural and the supranatural, and he Shreck calls them his ""house of horrors"". In spite of some of the disbelief, one of them decides to give it a go. After all, if it can't be changed it's better to know. Dr Terror tells him that he is a courageous man, and tells him to touch the tarot cards three times. Dr Terror shows four cards.Tale 1:  Wereworlf Mr Tod Callaghan (Edward Underdown)'s office. There are to architects in that office, him and Jim ""Jamie"" Dawson (Neil McCallum) and Mrs. Deirdre Biddulph (Ursula Howells) wants to make some structural changes to her new house. A hansom carriage takes him to the mansion. It's a misty night. Caleb (Peter Madden) welcomes Mr Jamie. Valda (Katy Wild) opens the door - she's Caleb's grandchild. They three used to know each other from childhood. Jim's family used to live there for centuries before, until they had to sell it. Deirdre used to be a doctor's wife, but now as a widow she's still beautiful. She wants to demolish a wall to create a bigger ballroom. She had suffered a nervous breakdown at her husband's funeral; he used to be an archaeologist, and she wants to make a museum in his honour.Jim hears an owl which interrupts their conversation, but can't see anything. Valda seems to be spying on him all the time. Caleb didn't grease a door to the basement. He notices scratches on a wall. There's a hidden room behind that plaster wall. Caleb says it's Cosmo Waldemar's coffin. Cosmo allegedly said that the Dawsons stole the mansion from him, and that one of them would take his place in his coffin; But that happened 200 years ago. In spite of that, the plaster looked new. They can't open the coffin, so they go to find another tool. Immediately, the coffin opens from the inside. The basement door is open and there are footprints on the floor but Deirdre didn't see anything leave the home.Valda leaves a note for Jim saying that she wants to talk with him. Caleb finds her immediately, dead. There are bloodstains which lead to the basement. Jim follows them to Cosmo's coffin. Jim tells Deirdre to lock herself in her bedroom. Jim will use a silver crucifix to make silver bullets for the gun which Caleb is going to lend to him. Deirdre is reading, and she is attacked by a wolf. Jim shoots it, but it runs away.It's Deirdre who's dangerous. Cosmo will live again when a descendant of the man who killed him will be in the coffin. She is Cosmo Waldemar's widow and has been loyal to him for 200 years.The fifth card is DEATH. Jim is nervous, because he's going to that same place. Mr Franklyn Marsh (Christopher Lee) is very cynic about it all, as he thinks that Dr Terror is just a smooth operator. He thinks that Dr Terror knew his name because he's a renown art critic. Another one says that he's never heard of him.Another candidate is Bill Rogers (Alan Freeman). Now he's going on a holiday with his wife and daughter, but when he returns...Tale 2: Creeping VineBill, Carol (Phoebe Nicholls) and Ann (Ann Bell) return home. The latter notices a new plant and tells Bill to kill it off before it affects her flowers. Bill can't cut the plant, and it looks like it screamed. Jerry Drake (Jeremy Kemp) is a botanist who's going to check it out. Carol plays with Rusty, the dog, and a ball. She goes to have tea, and leaves Rusty to pick up a small playball next to the plant. The plant kills Rusty, which was messing with the soil all over the place. Hopkins (Bernard Lee) makes a study about vegetable life; it must be a mutation which has given the plant some intelligence to protect themselves. They think it's a fantasy, but a plant like that could take on the world.Under the microscope, a brain is found in one of the plants. Carol won't play in the yard without Rusty. The plant attacks Jerry and strangles him. The vine cuts the phone wire and doesn't let anyone out. Ann holds Carol. The vine is all over the windows. Hopkins realises that the vine is afraid of fire when it tries to get away from a match he lights. Hopkins uses that to leave the home and call for help. However, the vine kills him and learns to put the fire out.Dr Horror has as the fifth card death's again. Marsh isn't courageous enough to touch the cards three times.Tale 3: VoodooWally (Russ Henderson) is a musician at a band; he plays the trumpet. The agent, Roy Shine (Harold Lang) sends him to Dupont, in the West Indies, where he'll play at the Flamingo. Sammy Coin (Kenny Lynch) is leaving, and the band is his replacement. The cigarette lady (Valerie St. Clair) has a huge weird ring. Everybody stares at Biff Bailey (Roy Castle) who is mocking voodoo. Sammy tells him not to mess with it, but Biff won't pay attention, and he sees the ritual. Cigarette girl is there, dancing and having a fit. Biff doesn't real that he's been surrounded by male dancers. Vrim (Christopher Carlos) is furious that Biff has written the music of the god Dambala (Thomas Baptiste). Vrim pushes Biff away. Biff says that he'll record the song when he's back in London. He's not afraid of Dambala, but at that moment the balustrade breaks under him, and he falls to a pond.Back in London, a musician (Tubby Hayes) tells him to be careful messing with voodoo. Biff and his band play a tune based on the voodoo rhythm. There's an image of Dambala as well. The breeze becomes wind, windows open, it becomes night, customers start to leave and panic spreads. The owner decides to do up all the place again when he collects on insurance. Tubby advises Biff not to take Dambala or the score home. Biff is nervous and falls to the floor. There is a commercial for Dr Terror's House of Horrors .Biff arrives home, where he lives alone. The window closes because of the wind, the lights turn themselves out and Dambala picks the score from his voodoo song from the fainting Biff. He leaves while Biff is still on the floor. Biff wants to see his fifth card, and sees that it's the death.Tale 4: Disembodied HandFranklyn Marsh says that Eric Landor (Michael Gough)'s painting is remarkable... because it's an atrocity. A group of spectators. a Lady (Faith Kent) tells Landor of what's happening. The painter goes out to talk to Marsh and question his authority to judge his black-and-white abstract etchings. The lady brings out a colourful painting, whom Marsh praises to no end: the balance, the colour, the brushwork, the humour of the whole composition. Landor shows him and the audience who painted everything: it was a monkey dressed in overalls and a navy t-shirt. A spectator (Pauline Chamberlain) laughs with a shrill voice.At a formal dinner, a toastmaster (Frank Forsyth) introduces Marsh, who has to give a speech, but Landor shows him cutouts of a monkey, and that makes Franklyn feel dizzy. In another exhibition, Landon inquiries about Marsh's opinions. Landon scares him away just for standing by his side. Marsh runs over Landor in purpose.

[Synopsis by bj_kuehl]--------------------------KrystelClaire's synopsis:We begin with the 7:55 train for Bradley. Five very different gentlemen coincide in a coach. One of them is a weirdly mysterious tarot reader Dr Shreck (Peter Cushing), who seems to be checking his company. The initials in his briefcase read W. R. S.. Its contents fall to the floor, and Dr Bob Carroll (Donald Sutherland) wonders at the strange cards. Dr Shreck is a doctor in Metaphysics, and his surname means ""terror"", so he is the Dr Terror of the title. He says that he sometimes predicts horrible things, although he's an amiable person. These tarot cards predict the natural and the supranatural, and he Shreck calls them his ""house of horrors"". In spite of some of the disbelief, one of them decides to give it a go. After all, if it can't be changed it's better to know. Dr Terror tells him that he is a courageous man, and tells him to touch the tarot cards three times. Dr Terror shows four cards.Tale 1:  Wereworlf Mr Tod Callaghan (Edward Underdown)'s office. There are to architects in that office, him and Jim ""Jamie"" Dawson (Neil McCallum) and Mrs. Deirdre Biddulph (Ursula Howells) wants to make some structural changes to her new house. A hansom carriage takes him to the mansion. It's a misty night. Caleb (Peter Madden) welcomes Mr Jamie. Valda (Katy Wild) opens the door - she's Caleb's grandchild. They three used to know each other from childhood. Jim's family used to live there for centuries before, until they had to sell it. Deirdre used to be a doctor's wife, but now as a widow she's still beautiful. She wants to demolish a wall to create a bigger ballroom. She had suffered a nervous breakdown at her husband's funeral; he used to be an archaeologist, and she wants to make a museum in his honour.Jim hears an owl which interrupts their conversation, but can't see anything. Valda seems to be spying on him all the time. Caleb didn't grease a door to the basement. He notices scratches on a wall. There's a hidden room behind that plaster wall. Caleb says it's Cosmo Waldemar's coffin. Cosmo allegedly said that the Dawsons stole the mansion from him, and that one of them would take his place in his coffin; But that happened 200 years ago. In spite of that, the plaster looked new. They can't open the coffin, so they go to find another tool. Immediately, the coffin opens from the inside. The basement door is open and there are footprints on the floor but Deirdre didn't see anything leave the home.Valda leaves a note for Jim saying that she wants to talk with him. Caleb finds her immediately, dead. There are bloodstains which lead to the basement. Jim follows them to Cosmo's coffin. Jim tells Deirdre to lock herself in her bedroom. Jim will use a silver crucifix to make silver bullets for the gun which Caleb is going to lend to him. Deirdre is reading, and she is attacked by a wolf. Jim shoots it, but it runs away.It's Deirdre who's dangerous. Cosmo will live again when a descendant of the man who killed him will be in the coffin. She is Cosmo Waldemar's widow and has been loyal to him for 200 years.The fifth card is DEATH. Jim is nervous, because he's going to that same place. Mr Franklyn Marsh (Christopher Lee) is very cynic about it all, as he thinks that Dr Terror is just a smooth operator. He thinks that Dr Terror knew his name because he's a renown art critic. Another one says that he's never heard of him.Another candidate is Bill Rogers (Alan Freeman). Now he's going on a holiday with his wife and daughter, but when he returns...Tale 2: Creeping VineBill, Carol (Phoebe Nicholls) and Ann (Ann Bell) return home. The latter notices a new plant and tells Bill to kill it off before it affects her flowers. Bill can't cut the plant, and it looks like it screamed. Jerry Drake (Jeremy Kemp) is a botanist who's going to check it out. Carol plays with Rusty, the dog, and a ball. She goes to have tea, and leaves Rusty to pick up a small playball next to the plant. The plant kills Rusty, which was messing with the soil all over the place. Hopkins (Bernard Lee) makes a study about vegetable life; it must be a mutation which has given the plant some intelligence to protect themselves. They think it's a fantasy, but a plant like that could take on the world.Under the microscope, a brain is found in one of the plants. Carol won't play in the yard without Rusty. The plant attacks Jerry and strangles him. The vine cuts the phone wire and doesn't let anyone out. Ann holds Carol. The vine is all over the windows. Hopkins realises that the vine is afraid of fire when it tries to get away from a match he lights. Hopkins uses that to leave the home and call for help. However, the vine kills him and learns to put the fire out.Dr Horror has as the fifth card death's again. Marsh isn't courageous enough to touch the cards three times.Tale 3: VoodooWally (Russ Henderson) is a musician at a band; he plays the trumpet. The agent, Roy Shine (Harold Lang) sends him to Dupont, in the West Indies, where he'll play at the Flamingo. Sammy Coin (Kenny Lynch) is leaving, and the band is his replacement. The cigarette lady (Valerie St. Clair) has a huge weird ring. Everybody stares at Biff Bailey (Roy Castle) who is mocking voodoo. Sammy tells him not to mess with it, but Biff won't pay attention, and he sees the ritual. Cigarette girl is there, dancing and having a fit. Biff doesn't real that he's been surrounded by male dancers. Vrim (Christopher Carlos) is furious that Biff has written the music of the god Dambala (Thomas Baptiste). Vrim pushes Biff away. Biff says that he'll record the song when he's back in London. He's not afraid of Dambala, but at that moment the balustrade breaks under him, and he falls to a pond.Back in London, a musician (Tubby Hayes) tells him to be careful messing with voodoo. Biff and his band play a tune based on the voodoo rhythm. There's an image of Dambala as well. The breeze becomes wind, windows open, it becomes night, customers start to leave and panic spreads. The owner decides to do up all the place again when he collects on insurance. Tubby advises Biff not to take Dambala or the score home. Biff is nervous and falls to the floor. There is a commercial for Dr Terror's House of Horrors .Biff arrives home, where he lives alone. The window closes because of the wind, the lights turn themselves out and Dambala picks the score from his voodoo song from the fainting Biff. He leaves while Biff is still on the floor. Biff wants to see his fifth card, and sees that it's the death.Tale 4: Disembodied HandFranklyn Marsh says that Eric Landor (Michael Gough)'s painting is remarkable... because it's an atrocity. A group of spectators. a Lady (Faith Kent) tells Landor of what's happening. The painter goes out to talk to Marsh and question his authority to judge his black-and-white abstract etchings. The lady brings out a colourful painting, whom Marsh praises to no end: the balance, the colour, the brushwork, the humour of the whole composition. Landor shows him and the audience who painted everything: it was a monkey dressed in overalls and a navy t-shirt. A spectator (Pauline Chamberlain) laughs with a shrill voice.At a formal dinner, a toastmaster (Frank Forsyth) introduces Marsh, who has to give a speech, but Landor shows him cutouts of a monkey, and that makes Franklyn feel dizzy. In another exhibition, Landon inquiries about Marsh's opinions. Landon scares him away just for standing by his side. Marsh runs over Landor in purpose. At hospital, a nurse (Judy Cornwell) tells the surgeon that the patient is Eric Landor, the artist. The surgeon says ""not anymore"". The newscast announces that Landor is at St Michael's hospital, still unconscious. Eric Landor wakes up to find that his right hand is missing. Franklyn tells workpal George (Brian Hawkins) at the newspaper that he can't concentrate, and doesn't want to go for a drink. Eric Landor commits suicide because his professional life is over. A hand crawls behind Franklyn Marsh while he's driving. The hand attacks him but Marsh throws it out of the window. He gets home feeling very distressed. There are some knocks on the door, but nobody outside number 27. Marsh locks himself in without realising that the hand has crawled in. He tries to get his shit together until he feels the hand is grabbing one of his legs. He puts the dusty hand on the bonfire of his fireplace.The following day, the darkened hand crawls into his office and gets up into his table; then, it jumps to his neck to strangle it. Marsh uses a letter opener to stab the hand several times, and put it into a box. He wraps the box into a packet and throws it into a river. George and Franklyn drink at a pub. Another friend (John Martin) congratulates Franklyn in solving whatever problem was affecting him. It's a dark, rainy night when Franklyn leaves home, driving. Suddenly, the hand appears outside the windscreen holding onto a wiper. Franklyn's so startled that he steers like a madman and has a car accident. When the police and the ambulance arrive, a man (Walter Sparrow) comments that Franklyn won't die, but that he'll be blind forever. He comments that there are many things which a blind man can still do. The Franklyn Marsh in the train is startled about the story although he doesn't want to admit it. Dr Terror picks the death card again when he's questioned how to prevent this from happening.Tale 5: VampireDr Bob Carroll (Donald Sutherland) cuts himself with a can opener.

A newly constructed gallows has been set up in the middle of town and is being tested with sandbags. As they walk through town, drifting through the crowded main street, Sam and Sunrise continue, relating that Cat killed a man in Wolf City, Wyoming.After the opening credits, Sam and Sunrise stop outside the town jail as a group of temperance woman exhort Pray Jezebel, pray. Cat's barred jail cell window looks out at the gallows. She is putting finishing touches on a white dress hanging on a dress form.Sam and Sunrise finish their song, promising to answer for us, ""how come they're now going to hang you and how did you begin?"" In her jail cell, there is a framed photo of Cat on her graduation day, 1894.FLASHBACKOne year earlier. A train conductor calls out the town of Sumqua as an older woman escorts Cat down the aisle, telling Cat that she is on the threshold of life, having graduated from her academy with a first rate education. As Cat follows the older woman, a man in a sleeping berth peeks out and wolf calls at Cat. Another man walking by with a piglet in his arms leers at Cat. The older woman points out a young man (Michael Callan) sitting in a bench with an older man as being clean. The older man tells the two ladies that the young man is in his custody, at which the young man, smiling, holds up his arm, showing the ladies that he is handcuffed to the older man. The older woman hurriedly guides Catherine away. The young man leans into the aisle to glare at Cat and gives a wolf whistle.Further up the compartment, the older woman notices a man dressed as a parson and asks if he can look after Cat. She says goodbye to Cat, asking her to be a good schoolteacher. Cat sits, the old woman, Miss Parker, leaves.Cat looks back down the aisle and the man in custody is still staring at her. There is a young priest, a parson (Dwayne Hickman), seated right next to her. She introduces herself to the parson as Cat Ballou, and he introduces himself as ""Drunk as a skunk"" and apologizes for his condition. He claims it was the first time he's had alcohol and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. She pulls out a book from her satchel a collection by Tennyson. He grabs it and starts to read definitely not Tennyson something about Kid Shelleen. It turns out Cat had a dime novel nested inside, Kid Shelleen and the Massacre of Whiskey Slide. He gives it back to her and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. A conductor comes by and directs her to a sleeping birth.The parson stumbles off as well and enters a restroom where the man in custody has been handcuffed by the sink as he washes his face. When the lawman appears and blocks the door, the parson blurts out a few nonsensical bible verses. The lawman frisks the parson and steps back to let him in. The parson asks the man in custody if he'd like to hear any bible verses, to which the man replies with a laugh. The parson opens his bible, which has a carved out middle, pulls out a small hand gun, points it at the sheriff, and soberly tells him to raise his hands. The parson covers the sheriff as the man in custody, thanking the priest and calling him Uncle Jed, goes through the sheriffs pockets, and unlocks his handcuff. The sheriff puts up a fight and they struggle but they knock him cold and cuff him to a pipe under the sink. The man and the parson run through the compartment Cat peeks her head out of her lower bunk and sees them and they stop at the gangway. The man asks if the parson has a gun for him, and the parson asks if he took the sheriffs gun. He didn't. The man tells the parson to jump off the train, but the parson looks down and only sees a steep cliff above a rocky sea shore. The man throws the parsons suitcase off the train and then shoves the parson off, too, with him landing safely on a grassy patch. The man runs back to the restroom passing Cat again but hears a gunshot and runs back toward the exit, then ducking into Cats curtain-shrouded sleeping berth. The conductor asks the sheriff what happened and he tells him the prisoner escaped with the help of the parson. The conductor asks if it was the parson sitting with the young girl and they go to her berth. The man in custody has his hand over Cat's mouth, and whispers ""Please"" to her. Cat pops her head out when the sheriff comes by and shakes her head when he asks if she's seen either man. The conductor leads the sheriff to the next car.Cat, in a nightgown, tells herself she shouldn't have done that it was morally wrong. The man, lying next to her, assures her it was the right thing to do. She admits she didn't want the man to get hurt. He snuggles close to her and she tells him to back off. Cat tells him he has to leave when the commotion dies down, and peeks out again down the aisle. He takes advantage of the situation and slips his arm between her head and the pillow. She pushes him off and he rolls on top of her, saying he just wants to see if the coast is clear. She sits up and switches to the other end of the berth. He looks out and sees passengers gathered by the end of the car, where the conductor directed the sheriff; but the other end of the car is passenger-free. He pops back in and tells Cat he saw people with shotguns. He says he will face the shotguns, so as to keep from compromising Cat. He gives her his pocket watch. Touched, she hugs him but then realizes what he is doing. She says she will keep an eye out instead and leans out. He sighs at the sight of her behind in his face. She pops back in and says she thought he was lying (about the people with shotguns) and, surprised, he asks if she meant he wasn't, and peeks out himself. The sheriff, carrying a shotgun, is coming down the aisle, checking each berth. The man ducks back in, slides open Cat's window and starts climbing out. He asks her name and introduces himself as Clay Boone. He kisses her on the mouth and jumps out with a whoop.Sam and Sunrise tell how Cat has returned home to Wolf City where the citizens live high on the hog and are upright, kind, reliable, friendly and neighborly. However, they sing, if Cat had behaved, she would have gotten along, but Cat was depraved and wicked through and through.Cat rides a buckboard through town to a ranch. As an Indian boy watches them, Cat notices an empty corral and asks her father Frank (John Marley), who is driving the wagon, where the horses are. He tells her he sold them, as he was tired of them. She is surprised the house is unpainted and decrepit. As they pull up and get off, the Indian boy comes by and her father introduces him as his new bronc-buster, and speaks Yiddish to him. The boy, Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini), obviously having been through this before, argues that he's a full Sioux Indian, and not one of the Chosen, as the father heard in a dubious lecture given by an ex-Congressman. The father takes Cat's satchel into the house and Jackson struggles with Cat's trunk. Out of earshot of her father, she asks Jackson whats been going on. He tells her the father has rubbed a lot of local people the wrong way. She is incredulous, saying that he is a sweet old bear, and Jackson agrees -- the father was the only one in the county who would give him a job. She says theirs used to be the best spread in the valley, but he shakes his head saying a new outfit is coming in, building factories, making Wolf City a real city. They want her father's water rights and he wont sell. The father comes back out to help with the trunk and promises to build lunch as soon as they go back in. Cat turns toward the house, insisting that she will cook from now on, and runs into a man (Lee Marvin), dressed in black, with a silver prosthetic nose strapped to his face. Cat screams. The man asks if the father is Frankie Ballou, and the father tells him to beat it. The man, carrying a rifle, glares and then strolls off. She asks who he is and Frank ignores her. Jackson tells her the man in black is Tim Strawn, a hired killer who had his nose bit off in a fight. Frank scoffs and says if he were to be scared, he'd be afraid of the man who bit it off. Frank reassures Cat that they are going to eat and sleep and go on living, and go celebrate the Fall Harvest Day tomorrow. Cat watches Strawn ride off.That evening at a dance, as a trio plays, Frank leads Cat in wide circles, taking time out to pat a woman on the behind. Frank bumps into a table where men are playing cards, and a half a dozen men stand around glowering. One of the gamblers is the newly elected Sheriff Cardigan (Jay C. Flippen) who Frank clearly does not respect. Frank points at Cat reminding the sheriff that Cat is back in town, and demands the sheriff greet her courteously. Frank asks the sheriff if he knows who dumped manure into his well. The sheriff says no. Frank says, some sheriff, and storms off. Left with the men, Cat asks the man if he's really the sheriff and then ask why he doesn't help Frank figure out who poisoned his well, obviously in an effort to drive him off his land. The sheriff patronizingly explains that there are ramifications to peace offering that she wouldn't understand. Cat storms off, enraged, and commiserates with Jackson who is at the punch bowl. She asks what she is going to do, and Jackson muses, ""They gotta a gunfighter; you get a gunfighter"". She can't tell if he is being serious or making fun of her, but he replies that no one would bother her dad if Wild Bill Hickok or Bat Masterson were around. A square dance starts and Cat grabs Jackson's arm to go join in. Some of the cowboys who were standing by the card table glower at them as the couple mixes into the crowd.On the floor, Cat asks Jackson who would she get, and he replies, Kid Shelleen. She thought he was just a character in books, but Jackson says hes real and one of the best. He suggests writing Shelleen a letter. Cat dances to Frank on the floor and he says she shouldn't dance with Jackson because he's an Indian. She spins away and, to her surprise, winds up dancing with Clay Boone, the escaped convict from the train. She spins away, back to Frank, and he tells her she's just causing trouble for Jackson. She spins back to Clay and asks why he is there. He says he's looking for her, and she calls him an outlaw. Proudly, he says there's a reward of $25 for the capture of Jed, $35 for himself. Cat falls into a line dance and dances next to Jed, the same man from the train who impersonated a parson, who thanks her for helping him and his nephew (Clay and Jed are about the same age). Cat spins to Clay, who makes a kissy face at her. Cat spins back to Jed and asks where they are staying. He tells her they are hiding out among the crowd and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. Back with Clay, she asks if he has a gun and when he says, sure do, she invites him back home tonight. As Cat dances toward the stage, we see its Sam calling the dance, and Sunrise at the piano. Cat spins to Jackson and compliments him on his dancing. He says he danced on the reservation : buffalo dance, rain dance, and then looking back at the cowboys glowering at them, says, war dance. They dance away and the men step onto the floor, accosting Jackson. The chief glowerer calls Jackson, Low, and pokes Jackson on the chest. Jackson shrugs and says its ""Custers Last Stand all over again"" and punches the man, which instigates an all-out brawl. Frank goes to rescue Jackson, as everyone, including Cat, join in the fight. Jackson pulls off a toupee of an opponent and gives a war whoop. Cat throws a chair at the chief glowerer, knocking him out, and gives a war whoop as well. Clay and Jed sneak around the perimeter, trying not to get involved, but are tackled and piled on by a scrum. Frank cheers on the woman he had patted on the bottom, Mabel, as she beats up a mustached man. Two kids, watching from the hayloft, throw hay at each other.Frank drives the wagon back to the ranch with Cat, Jackson, Clay and Jed. They are singing happily and drunkenly. Cat gets off and lands in Clay's arms. Frank continues singing and literally falls off the wagon, caught just in time by Clay and Jed. They carry Frank, now passed out, into the house. Jackson whispers to Cat if she thinks the pair of free-loaders will be able to stop Strawn. She assures him that they are gunmen and have a price on their heads. Clay looks around, admiring the house with its living room, kitchen... and bedroom. Cat says Clay and Jed will sleep in the barn; Jackson tosses each a blanket.Before going to bed, Cat sits at her dresser and brushes her hair. Unknown to her, Clay is hiding under her covers, and he smiles when she blows a playful kiss to the mirror. She gets in bed and Clay slowly covers her mouth to keep her from screaming. She jumps out and demands that he gets out before her father catches them, but Clay assures her that the father is out cold. He invites her back to bed to spoon and she stands on the mattress and kicks him onto the floor. He heads toward the door, but with a change in tone, Cat asks where he's going and tells him not to go. He turns and smiles, but she tells him she just needs to talk to him. As he sits at the end of the bed, she tells him her father is a wonderful man, but the town hates him, has dropped manure into his well, has made him talk to lawyers, and now has sent a gunman around to drive him off. Clay thinks she is dreaming. She assures him she saw the gunman. He plays along and says, then he will help her pack; her father can defend himself. Frustrated she says Clay is useless, and he agrees. As she buries her face in her pillow, Clay suggests since they hired a gunman, that she do the same. She looks up briefly and buries her face again. He then asks her about the kiss she made before going to bed; Cat moans in frustration. He pauses and gets up to leave. She calls him back, saying that everyone has some good in them and can't be as depraved or cowardly as they may think. He grabs her shoulders and assures her that some people in the world are exactly as depraved and cowardly as they think. He leans in for a kiss but Jed pops up at the window and asks Clay how long they are staying. Cat reminds Jed she had helped him on the train and asks if he can help her now. She asks if he can stay, that there's someone trying to kill her father. Jed says they'll stay and do what they can. Cat nods at Clay and says then they wont need him, but Clay tells Cat that Jed has never shot at a man before its against his principles. Cat is incredulous and then Jed tells her that neither has Clay. They leave.Cat picks up the Kid Shelleen novel from her nightstand, thinks a little, and sits at her desk to write a letter.Sam and Sunrise sing about the arrival of a fast gun into town. A stagecoach pulls up outside the telegraph office. Cat and Jackson are waiting outside. They smile happily as a tall man exits the coach, but then five kids and a woman run up to hug him. The stage drivers open the back boot flap and balled up inside is a dusty drunk old man (also Lee Marvin in a dual roll), who is the gunfighter Kid Shelleen. They tug him out and he flops onto the ground, semi-conscious. The crew drops off his valise and a paper sack, and Cat and Jackson run up to the body. Jackson rolls him over; he's still passed out. She gets the men to carry him onto their wagon. Cat grabs the sack and gets in the back of the wagon with the man, Jackson retrieves the valise, and as Sam and Sunrise sing about ""the fastest gun you've ever seen"", Cat and Jackson drive off.Frank wedges a plank between the clapboards of his barn and draws a chalk circle on it. He walks back a few paces and we see Cat, Jackson, Clay and Jed as Frank demands Kid Shelleen shows him what Cat got for the $50 she laid out, now that hes had a few hours to sleep it off. Kid gets up, squares off, and reaches for his gun, but he doesn't have one he hocked it for drink money. Frank yells at Cat for wasting the money and for the possibility that the ill-spent $50 worth of drink could have killed the man. Cat says she didnt know he was a drunk, and at that, Kid turns to look at Cat, sadly. Clay steps up and hands Kid a revolver. Kid can barely hold the gun steady. Frank guesses that Kid would rather have a drink than a poke in the eye. Kid gets a shot off but hits the weather vane on top of the roof. Clay points out that Kid actually missed the barn. Kid rushes up to Frank, who recoils at Kids breath, and begs him for a nip to steady his hand. Frank asks Jackson if hes carrying the bottle he uses to get the sheriff mad. Kid takes a swig, and then another, and keeps the bottle when Jackson tries to take it back. In between more swigs, he tells them his recent history, including that he worked the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. He shoots and hits the circle on Franks plank, twice; a tin can on top of a trellis; and another tin can on another trellis, and then again as it flies off the trellis. Cat and the men are impressed. Kid almost finishes Jackson's bottle, and tosses it in the air, but when he tries to pull the gun from the front of his pants, his pants fall halfway down, he stumbles, and asks where the bottle went. Cat looks dejected. Kid rattles off some gunslinger philosophy. Cat tries to defend Kid, but Frank tells her to keep Kid away from him, and stomps away. Cat asks Kid where he will go now, and he replies that shes paid him, so he intends to stay. Cat says Kid will sleep in the barn. Clay takes back his gun. Jackson offers to carry Kid's valise, and Kid asks him how many are in the opposition. Jackson says, one, Tim Strawn, and at hearing that name, Kid rears back and stumbles away. He bends down to pick up Jackson's bottle and asks if Jackson is sure. When Jackson says, yes, Kid finishes the bottle.At lunch, Cat laments that Kid is in no condition to defend her father, and asks Jackson, Clay and Jed to stay by Franks side. They agree. Frank walks through the kitchen on his way out and the men get up and walk out with him. Cat yells at them not to let Frank out of their sight. Outside, with the men shadowing him, Frank says Cat is crazy, like her late mother, and tells the men that theres no one around to bother him. As he marches off, a shot rings out and Frank falls. In the distance Strawn, on horseback, points a rifle at them, and tells them to drop their gun belts. Cat rushes up to Frank who is dead. Strawn rides off and Cat gets on her horse and follows. The men retrieve their gun belts and follow as well.Cat makes it to town and finds Strawn sitting on a rocking chair outside the saloon. The Sheriff and a few men are standing nearby. Cat accuses Strawn of being a murderer, but the corrupt Sheriff lies by saying that's not possible since Strawn had been sitting right there all morning. The men with him agree. Understanding the situation, Cat angrily pounces on Strawn but is pulled back by Jackson, Clay and Jed. She takes Clays revolver from his belt and tries to shoot Strawn, but in the struggle misses wildly. Strawn pulls his own gun but looks around, knowing he is being baited. Defiantly, Cat tells the Sheriff that he won't make her cry, and turns to Strawn and says the same to him.As the sun sets, and as Cat and the men ride back home, Sam and Sunrise sing that there are teardrops in Cats heart, but they cant make her cry.As they come up to the house, most of her furniture has been moved outside and a man is sitting on the front porch who tells her that this is private property, pointing at a sign proclaiming, 'Property of Wolf City Development Corp. No Trespassing'. Cat pushes her way in and sees two undertakers standing next to Frank lying in a pine box. She demands to know why Frank has a smile on his face as hes never smiled before. The undertaker says its free, courtesy of the Wolf City Development Corp. She shoves them out. A man with a rifle comes up and tells Cat that they've dug a grave behind the barn and that they will stay to make sure that Cat and her men leave before morning.Cat says she doesn't want the ranch now that Frank is dead, but she wants Wolf City to know that she intends to make Shermans March look like a bird walk.Jed points out to Clay that Cat wont have a place to stay and Clay suggests they take her with them to Hole-in-the-Wall. However, Clay's not sure they will let her in, or even let him and Jed in. Cat brightens to the idea, saying that all they need is to be outlaws, and Clay and Jed have a price on their heads, so they are outlaws. Clay agrees, hesitantly.Kid stumbles in, drunk, saying that he's ready, and that anyone who tries to get Frank will have to go through him first. Jed directs his attention to Frank in the box, but Kid notices the candelabras around the coffin and starts singing Happy Birthday. Kid blows out the candles.The next morning, Cat and the men ride off as Sam and Sunrise sing about the beginning of the Legend of Cat Ballou. As Clay and Jed, riding behind Cat, admire her from behind. They are towing a riderless horse, which is pulling a litter with Kid lying down. Jackson, reaching down from his horse, hands Kid a bottle, which Kid bobbles and drops.They ride up on Hole-in-the-Wall and are met with kids scurrying to their mothers, and men patrolling the streets, carrying rifles. Kid sits up from the litter, sniffing, and says he smells a water hole its the town saloon. Kid stumbles in and yells for the bartender. Kid is recognized by the bartender, an aged, worn-out Butch Cassidy (Arthur Hunnicutt), knocked down the ladder of life by the cavalry and the Pinkertons and the changing West. Kid suggests they have a drink for old times sake which Cassidy knows means that Kid has no money. Kid offers him his guns in exchange, but Cassidy says the guns aren't worth anything, anymore; no one cares.Cat and the men are at a table. As Kid sits down with them, Clay is talking to Jed about getting back in to business. He thinks they will need more men and asks Jackson if he is interested in helping them rustle 50 head of cattle. Kid interrupts, asking if anyone wants to buy a round and continues to interrupt them, saying hell drink to that, after each point of conversation. Cat, reading a newspaper, says she is against their plan for raising money and suggests they rob a train. Clay and Jed ignore her and get back to talking rustling. Cat interrupts and points at an article about how 200 local men were recently hired to build a slaughterhouse and these men will need to be paid. She thinks there will be at least $1,000 to $2,000 in each payroll. Clay says that shes out of her mind -- they are rustlers, not train robbers. Jed waxes philosophical and urges her to get off the path of revenge.Cat pulls out her Kid Shelleen novel and flips to Kid Shelleens own plan to rob a train. Kid perks up at hearing of the plan HIS plan. As she reads, the men bow their heads and she becomes upset at their reluctance. She reminds them that they had said they love her and had promised to take care of her, but now she is only asking them to rob one little train and they turn on her. Cat runs outside and they follow. She picks up rocks and throws them at the men, calling them a horse ranch Indian, a drunken gunfighter, a sex maniac, and an uncle. As she continues to throw rocks, she calls them Clay Boone and his band of chicken rustlers. Jed says they never said, no. He asks her to stop crying and that they will do it for her. Kid, standing at the saloon door, wonders about the plan.A train rumbles through the countryside. Jed, sitting in a passenger car, checks his watch and walks out the back to another car. It is a well-appointed private car and there is a man (Reginald Denny) and his valet. The British-accented man is sitting in a bathtub. Jed says hes looking for the baggage car, and the man, miffed, directs him back forward. Jed exits and climbs up to the roof of the passenger car he had exited. Jed walks forward, making a lot of noise. Inside the baggage compartment at the front of the car, Cat, dressed in mourning clothes, leaning over a coffin, starts wailing loudly to keep the baggage employee distracted from Jed's noise. Jed climbs down and unhitches the passenger cars from the locomotive. The locomotive rumbles ahead without the cars, which slow down. Jackson and Kid are sitting on their horses, watching the whole situation from a distance. Kid takes a swig, but Jackson takes the bottle and admonishes him they have a job to do. They ride down to the tracks with two riderless horses in tow.Jed pulls the handbrake, causing packages in the baggage compartment to tumble around, and the water to slosh out of the Englishmans bathtub. As the baggage employee helps Cat up, a knock comes from the coffin. The employee backs away in fright as Cat looks heavenward and happily says, hes alive! Cat opens the coffin and Clay climbs out. With Cat nudging him, Clay pulls out his gun and holds it on the employee. Jed climbs into the baggage compartment as Jackson and Kid watch over the passengers. The Englishman walks in with a towel around his waist, demanding to speak to the person in charge. Kid says, he is, and that the train is being robbed. The Englishman demands they hurry it up because he is taking a bath. Kid pulls off the mans towel and the man scurries off.Ahead, the engineer notices his cars have been detached and reverses the locomotive. Jed finds the trains safe and Cat demands the employee open it. The man says no. Clay reminds him he as a gun, but the employee says that Clay will have to use it. Cat and the men huddle and whisper about what they are going to do. Kid walks up to the baggage compartment and sees the locomotive coming back. Kid asks whats wrong, and Clay tells him the employee wont open the safe and would rather die. Kid asks the man if thats true, and then shoots the mans hat off. The man immediately tells them the combination.Clay notes there's more than the one or two thousand dollars Cat predicted, in fact, there's probably $50,000. The locomotive backs into the cars and causes Cat and the men to fall over, and the Englishman's bathtub to slosh out water again. The engineer drives the re-attached train forward, causing the Englishman to fall out of the tub in a big splash. Jackson rides beside the train, towing the horses. Kid sees him and jumps off the train onto Jackson's horse. Clay urges Cat and Jed to jump, and they do, with the bag of money. They land safely and Cat whoops and hugs the men. Jackson and Kid ride up and Cat praises Kid for his plan. Kid waves his hand at Jackson and Jackson hands him the bottle. Clay asks Kid how the plan in the dime novel wound up, and Kid, taking a swig, says they ride off separately and meet back at Hole-in-the-Wall. Cat heads off, with Clay following her, and Jed following them. Jackson watches Kid finish the bottle.Kid tips off his horse and the horse gallops away as Kid drunkenly hangs off the saddle half-horizontally. Jackson follows and they ride past Sam and Sunrise who sing about Cat masterminding the train robbery.The train pulls into the next town and the conductor tells the sheriff what happened and he in turn rounds up a posse which rides off after Cat and her band of desperados. As they head out into the brush, Jackson and Kid, still uncontrolled on his horse, ride up behind the posse. Jackson grabs Kids reins and turns them back around. The posse follows. They split up and the posse divides in half to follow Jackson and Kid. Jackson catches up to Kid and they resume their escape.Back at Hole-in-the-Wall, Kid storms in to the saloon and boasts about their exploits to Cassidy. He notices, worriedly, that Cat and the men aren't there. They come in, elated, but Kid asks Cat why they were delayed and if Clay had bothered her. Clay says they were losing the posse; Jed says he was doing his job. Clay laughs to Jed that Kid is jealous. Kid grabs Clay by the shirt and tells him that Clay has no respect. Cat separates them and Clay tells Cassidy to get Kid a drink. Cassidy asks if they really did it and Cat proudly says that they did, her gang. She says they are going to wipe out Wolf City. She tells Cassidy that theres more where that came from and if they help her, there will be more for them. Cassidy picks up a money sack and reads the inscription : Wolf City Development, Property H. Percival. Cassidy tells Cat that Sir Harry Percival owns Wolf City Development, which owns Wolf City, which lets Hole-in-the-Wall alone. Cat decides that she should go after Percival and asks Cassidy to help. He refuses, as that would be cutting their own throats. Dejected, she tells Cassidy that Hole-in-the-Wall had the reputation for harboring cutthroats and murderers; that they used to whisper their names when they were kids scared to say them out loud. She scoffs they got old and walks out. Clay follows her.As she walks contemplatively in a copse of trees, Clay comes up behind Cat and surprises her. He grabs her and kisses her. He tells her they should go to Saint Louis now that they got the money, but she says now that Wolf City is desperate, she should continue her plan. They kiss and she tells him she thinks she loves him. He laughs it off; that she's being too serious. She says he's not as cowardly as he thinks he is, that he may be selfish and a little stupid, but not cowardly. She says she sees his faults but loves him anyway. He says he sees trouble, pointing toward the direction of the posse, and then, saying in Cats eyes as well. He says hes not going to be tied down by a girl and that he's going to Saint Louis. He warns her that shes going to get herself killed. He walks off, saying he never promised he was going to be a hero. She yells back that hes not a hero and tells him to leave. He says bye and walks off.Jackson has overheard some of their conversation and comes up to Cat. She asks what is happening. He tells her that when the gods decide to make a man crazy, that they just made him fall in love. She discounts that, wondering who is falling in love with whom. She asks Jackson if he will stay, and he says he likes being on the winning side for a change. He walks away.Cat continues her walk and Strawn rides up and tells her Sir Harry wants his money back. He adds that if she wasn't a girl, that he'd split her like a chicken. She screams as he rides off. Jackson, Jed and Kid run up. Jackson and Jed console Cat as Kid stares after Strawn. Kid calls Jackson over and tells him to find his valise and to get a case of cartridges from Cassidy. As Jackson runs off, Kid walks over to Cat and assures her everything will be okay.Kid decides to become sober and clean himself up for his confrontation with Strawn. As Kid rubs his trembling hands together, Jackson brings him the valise. Kid does some sit-ups. Jackson massages the Kid's back as the Kid tests the steadiness of his hands. Kid practices his quick draw -- at first Jackson is able to clap before Kid can level his gun, but Kid gets faster as they go. Kid shoots at cans and bottles that Jackson tosses in the air. He hits every one. Jackson asks Kid if he wants a drink, but Kid tells him, ""no booze"". Jackson adds water as Kid takes a steaming bath. Kid shaves with a straight razor.Jackson opens the valise and takes out a girdle. Jackson helps Kid, standing in front of a full-length mirror in his long johns, get into the girdle. As Jackson helps him with his shirt, Kid looks at his hand; it is steady. Kid has silvery garters for his shirt sleeves and a matching vest. Jackson helps him with his gun belt with a garish silver buckle. Kid holsters his shiny guns. Jackson helps him put on his hat with a silver hat band. Kid is now sober and dressed in his finest.Sam and Sunrise are singing and play piano at a brothel. Kid comes in, spurs jangling, and goes upstairs. He walks down the hall, opening each door, only to be greeted by a woman's scream... and then a mans scream, where Kid does a double-take. At the last door, he finds Strawn. Strawn, sitting, says ""it's been a long time"". Kid notices Strawn's silver nose and strap on the dresser. Strawn asks Kid if he's there for money or for a job. Kid squares up. Strawn stands and notes that there's never been any love lost between them. Strawn goes for his gun, but Kid says he cant, and turns away. Strawn draws anyway, Kid kneels down and draws. In the drawing room, the Englishman is being entertained by three prostitutes. We hear the gun shot.Back at the Hole-in-the-Wall saloon, a black clad man with a silver nose barges in. Cat shrieks, but its Kid. He takes off the nose and twirls it by the strap. He happily kicks back in a chair and says it was just swell. Kid says that even when they were kids, Strawn would always sneak around and shoot kids in the back, and he thinks Strawn thought Kid was still on the booze. Cat is surprised that Kid and Strawn used to play together as kids. Kid says that he and Strawn are twin brothers; Cat, Jackson and Jed are shocked. Kid continues to reminisce and says he took Strawn just like the dime novel said.Clay busts in and says that Kid has brought the roof down; that half of Wolf City is on its way to Hole-in-the-Wall. Kid looks at Cat and assures her they can take them like they did last time. Clay continues and says that Percival has added at least fifty of his own goons. Kid grabs Clay by the arm and demands that he try to remember if the men were professionals or just barroom sweeps. Clay describes them as professionals. Kid says that with Strawn dead, they might as well be sweeps. Clay warns that Strawn was just a hired hand, and that these men are an army. He grabs Cat and says he's taking her out of there. Cat asks Clay if hes sure about the men. As he embraces Cat, Kid says if Percival wants a fight, then they'll give him one he and Cat Ballou. Clay accuses Kid of wanting to die. Kid says he's done everything he's wanted to do and been everywhere he's wanted to go. He says he and Cat can make history. Clay accuses Kid of trying to get Cat killed. Kid says its better than dying in a dirty hotel, or off somewhere drunk a fate he was always afraid of for himself until Cat came along. Cat tenderly tells Kid that there are places she wants to see and things she wants to do.Clay says now she is making sense, that they can now go to Saint Louis. She rejects him. He suggests Sioux Falls. She rejects him again. He asks if shes afraid to be seen with him that he will marry her. Cat is indignant that he thinks THAT is what a woman wants a man to say or do in order to save her. She runs out.Kid glares at Clay and says he's been studying her and now realizes that Cat loves Clay, not himself. He also realizes Clay had been laughing at him the whole time and says that he will make Clay do the right thing. Kid circles the table, grabs a chair and smashes it into little pieces. Jed and Jackson grab Clay and hold him away from Kid. Kid proposes guns, bottles, fists, knives, clubs, they're all the same to him. Clay doesn't know what Kid is talking about. Kid demands he marry Cat. Clay says he would, but Cat won't. Kid philosophizes that ""at first you can't stand to get hit, but then you realize you CAN take it, because the blood doesn't matter and you know you're going to live"". Kid tells Clay that he's giving Clay a gift to know that it doesn't hurt to fight. Kid chases Clay around the saloon and roundhouses him into Jed. Jed punches Clay into a chair, saying that Clay is kin and has been a millstone around his neck all his life. Clay stumbles to Kid, realizes what he is doing, and stumbles toward Jackson, who also punches him, saying everyone else was doing it and he shouldn't be excluded for reasons of race, creed or color according to the Fourteenth Amendment. Cassidy pops his head in and asks if he can have his saloon back now that Cat is leaving. They all rush to the window to see her riding off.Cat, dressed like a prostitute, calls on Percivals private railroad car. The valet introduces her as a consolation from the town. Percival is beside himself. She takes off her stole, revealing a low-cut dress, and hands it to the valet who scurries off. Percival asks if she wants a drink and he calls the valet to bring it. She says her name is Trixie and says shes never seen a train car like this and he shows her the bedroom. The valet brings champagne and Percival dismisses him for the evening.Percival turns to put on a phonograph and to dim the lights and when he turns back around, Cat has a gun on him. She re-introduces herself as Catherine, Frank Ballous daughter. He is not impressed. She produces a rolled up piece of paper from her bodice and demands that he signs it. Its a confession, saying that he hired Strawn to kill Frank. He asks what if he doesn't sign, and she says shell kill him. He is still not impressed. He doubts she has it in her, and goes for the gun. They struggle and the gun goes off; Percival falls dead.CURRENT TIMEBack outside the town jail, Cat, in her white dress, watches through her window as the temperance women continue to sing. The crowd outside is now much larger. The Sheriff, standing outside her cell, has been eyeing his pocket watch, and happily declares it is time. Cat looks out the window again and says she's sorry the people do not like her. The Sheriff says its understandable, since her killing Percival ended the plans for the slaughterhouse, so now there are no jobs, and no payroll. He continues that she took the bread out of the mouths of half of Wolf City; and that she doesnt have a friend in the world. The Sheriff calls for the reverend. As he blurts out a few nonsensical bible verses, Cat recognizes it is Jed.... dressed once again in his parson's disguise. He leads her out of the cell.Meanwhile, Jackson, dressed like an undertaker, runs up and sees Kid on his horse, both slumped against the jail house wall... drunk once again. Jackson is disappointed that Kid chose this time to fall of the wagon and that they are all counting on him. Kid waves him off.Jed walks Cat through the jeering crowd. The temperance women are singing Rock of Ages. On the gallows are the Sheriff and a few men including the hangman and Jed. The Sheriff tells the crowd to quiet, and asks Cat for her last words. She says, ""Let's get on with it"". The Sheriff gives the signal and the hangman puts the noose around Cat's neck. She looks back at Jed but he just looks away. Under the gallows, in the coffin intended for Cats body, Clay lifts the lid and peeks out. Jackson, sitting on the horse-drawn hearse next to the gallows, looks back and sees Kid in the same position he was before. The Sheriff gives the signal and a man pulls the lever. Cat falls. Jed has produced a razor from his fake bible and cuts the rope. Clay is under the trapdoor and catches Cat in his arms. Jackson has the side door to the hearse open, and Clay helps Cat inside; he follows her. Jed jumps off the gallows onto the roof of the hearse and sits down next to Jackson. They ride off. Jed asks Jackson where Kid is, but Jackson shakes his head. As they drive down the main street, men with rifles follow, and Kid finally rides into view, half-horizontally again. He shoots randomly causing a banner to fall and tangle up a man on a horse. Another shot frightens some draft horses that run off and spill their load of beer casks, which causes the road to become slippery, and other riders to slip and fall.

    Synopsis
    The Columbia torchbearer morphs into an animated version who takes off her gown revealing herself to be a female gunslinger who draws her pistols from their holsters and gleefully shoots into the air every which way.Two balladeers, Professor Sam the Shade (Stubby Kayne) and the Sunrise Kid (Nat King Cole), playing banjos, tell us in song that ""you're now about to hear, the ballad of Cat Ballou"" (Jane Fonda). A newly constructed gallows has been set up in the middle of town and is being tested with sandbags. As they walk through town, drifting through the crowded main street, Sam and Sunrise continue, relating that Cat killed a man in Wolf City, Wyoming.After the opening credits, Sam and Sunrise stop outside the town jail as a group of temperance woman exhort Pray Jezebel, pray. Cat's barred jail cell window looks out at the gallows. She is putting finishing touches on a white dress hanging on a dress form.Sam and Sunrise finish their song, promising to answer for us, ""how come they're now going to hang you and how did you begin?"" In her jail cell, there is a framed photo of Cat on her graduation day, 1894.FLASHBACKOne year earlier. A train conductor calls out the town of Sumqua as an older woman escorts Cat down the aisle, telling Cat that she is on the threshold of life, having graduated from her academy with a first rate education. As Cat follows the older woman, a man in a sleeping berth peeks out and wolf calls at Cat. Another man walking by with a piglet in his arms leers at Cat. The older woman points out a young man (Michael Callan) sitting in a bench with an older man as being clean. The older man tells the two ladies that the young man is in his custody, at which the young man, smiling, holds up his arm, showing the ladies that he is handcuffed to the older man. The older woman hurriedly guides Catherine away. The young man leans into the aisle to glare at Cat and gives a wolf whistle.Further up the compartment, the older woman notices a man dressed as a parson and asks if he can look after Cat. She says goodbye to Cat, asking her to be a good schoolteacher. Cat sits, the old woman, Miss Parker, leaves.Cat looks back down the aisle and the man in custody is still staring at her. There is a young priest, a parson (Dwayne Hickman), seated right next to her. She introduces herself to the parson as Cat Ballou, and he introduces himself as ""Drunk as a skunk"" and apologizes for his condition. He claims it was the first time he's had alcohol and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. She pulls out a book from her satchel a collection by Tennyson. He grabs it and starts to read definitely not Tennyson something about Kid Shelleen. It turns out Cat had a dime novel nested inside, Kid Shelleen and the Massacre of Whiskey Slide. He gives it back to her and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. A conductor comes by and directs her to a sleeping birth.The parson stumbles off as well and enters a restroom where the man in custody has been handcuffed by the sink as he washes his face. When the lawman appears and blocks the door, the parson blurts out a few nonsensical bible verses. The lawman frisks the parson and steps back to let him in. The parson asks the man in custody if he'd like to hear any bible verses, to which the man replies with a laugh. The parson opens his bible, which has a carved out middle, pulls out a small hand gun, points it at the sheriff, and soberly tells him to raise his hands. The parson covers the sheriff as the man in custody, thanking the priest and calling him Uncle Jed, goes through the sheriffs pockets, and unlocks his handcuff. The sheriff puts up a fight and they struggle but they knock him cold and cuff him to a pipe under the sink. The man and the parson run through the compartment Cat peeks her head out of her lower bunk and sees them and they stop at the gangway. The man asks if the parson has a gun for him, and the parson asks if he took the sheriffs gun. He didn't. The man tells the parson to jump off the train, but the parson looks down and only sees a steep cliff above a rocky sea shore. The man throws the parsons suitcase off the train and then shoves the parson off, too, with him landing safely on a grassy patch. The man runs back to the restroom passing Cat again but hears a gunshot and runs back toward the exit, then ducking into Cats curtain-shrouded sleeping berth. The conductor asks the sheriff what happened and he tells him the prisoner escaped with the help of the parson. The conductor asks if it was the parson sitting with the young girl and they go to her berth. The man in custody has his hand over Cat's mouth, and whispers ""Please"" to her. Cat pops her head out when the sheriff comes by and shakes her head when he asks if she's seen either man. The conductor leads the sheriff to the next car.Cat, in a nightgown, tells herself she shouldn't have done that it was morally wrong. The man, lying next to her, assures her it was the right thing to do. She admits she didn't want the man to get hurt. He snuggles close to her and she tells him to back off. Cat tells him he has to leave when the commotion dies down, and peeks out again down the aisle. He takes advantage of the situation and slips his arm between her head and the pillow. She pushes him off and he rolls on top of her, saying he just wants to see if the coast is clear. She sits up and switches to the other end of the berth. He looks out and sees passengers gathered by the end of the car, where the conductor directed the sheriff; but the other end of the car is passenger-free. He pops back in and tells Cat he saw people with shotguns. He says he will face the shotguns, so as to keep from compromising Cat. He gives her his pocket watch. Touched, she hugs him but then realizes what he is doing. She says she will keep an eye out instead and leans out. He sighs at the sight of her behind in his face. She pops back in and says she thought he was lying (about the people with shotguns) and, surprised, he asks if she meant he wasn't, and peeks out himself. The sheriff, carrying a shotgun, is coming down the aisle, checking each berth. The man ducks back in, slides open Cat's window and starts climbing out. He asks her name and introduces himself as Clay Boone. He kisses her on the mouth and jumps out with a whoop.Sam and Sunrise tell how Cat has returned home to Wolf City where the citizens live high on the hog and are upright, kind, reliable, friendly and neighborly. However, they sing, if Cat had behaved, she would have gotten along, but Cat was depraved and wicked through and through.Cat rides a buckboard through town to a ranch. As an Indian boy watches them, Cat notices an empty corral and asks her father Frank (John Marley), who is driving the wagon, where the horses are. He tells her he sold them, as he was tired of them. She is surprised the house is unpainted and decrepit. As they pull up and get off, the Indian boy comes by and her father introduces him as his new bronc-buster, and speaks Yiddish to him. The boy, Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini), obviously having been through this before, argues that he's a full Sioux Indian, and not one of the Chosen, as the father heard in a dubious lecture given by an ex-Congressman. The father takes Cat's satchel into the house and Jackson struggles with Cat's trunk. Out of earshot of her father, she asks Jackson whats been going on. He tells her the father has rubbed a lot of local people the wrong way. She is incredulous, saying that he is a sweet old bear, and Jackson agrees -- the father was the only one in the county who would give him a job. She says theirs used to be the best spread in the valley, but he shakes his head saying a new outfit is coming in, building factories, making Wolf City a real city. They want her father's water rights and he wont sell. The father comes back out to help with the trunk and promises to build lunch as soon as they go back in. Cat turns toward the house, insisting that she will cook from now on, and runs into a man (Lee Marvin), dressed in black, with a silver prosthetic nose strapped to his face. Cat screams. The man asks if the father is Frankie Ballou, and the father tells him to beat it. The man, carrying a rifle, glares and then strolls off. She asks who he is and Frank ignores her. Jackson tells her the man in black is Tim Strawn, a hired killer who had his nose bit off in a fight. Frank scoffs and says if he were to be scared, he'd be afraid of the man who bit it off. Frank reassures Cat that they are going to eat and sleep and go on living, and go celebrate the Fall Harvest Day tomorrow. Cat watches Strawn ride off.That evening at a dance, as a trio plays, Frank leads Cat in wide circles, taking time out to pat a woman on the behind. Frank bumps into a table where men are playing cards, and a half a dozen men stand around glowering. One of the gamblers is the newly elected Sheriff Cardigan (Jay C. Flippen) who Frank clearly does not respect. Frank points at Cat reminding the sheriff that Cat is back in town, and demands the sheriff greet her courteously. Frank asks the sheriff if he knows who dumped manure into his well. The sheriff says no. Frank says, some sheriff, and storms off. Left with the men, Cat asks the man if he's really the sheriff and then ask why he doesn't help Frank figure out who poisoned his well, obviously in an effort to drive him off his land. The sheriff patronizingly explains that there are ramifications to peace offering that she wouldn't understand. Cat storms off, enraged, and commiserates with Jackson who is at the punch bowl. She asks what she is going to do, and Jackson muses, ""They gotta a gunfighter; you get a gunfighter"". She can't tell if he is being serious or making fun of her, but he replies that no one would bother her dad if Wild Bill Hickok or Bat Masterson were around. A square dance starts and Cat grabs Jackson's arm to go join in. Some of the cowboys who were standing by the card table glower at them as the couple mixes into the crowd.On the floor, Cat asks Jackson who would she get, and he replies, Kid Shelleen. She thought he was just a character in books, but Jackson says hes real and one of the best. He suggests writing Shelleen a letter. Cat dances to Frank on the floor and he says she shouldn't dance with Jackson because he's an Indian. She spins away and, to her surprise, winds up dancing with Clay Boone, the escaped convict from the train. She spins away, back to Frank, and he tells her she's just causing trouble for Jackson. She spins back to Clay and asks why he is there. He says he's looking for her, and she calls him an outlaw. Proudly, he says there's a reward of $25 for the capture of Jed, $35 for himself. Cat falls into a line dance and dances next to Jed, the same man from the train who impersonated a parson, who thanks her for helping him and his nephew (Clay and Jed are about the same age). Cat spins to Clay, who makes a kissy face at her. Cat spins back to Jed and asks where they are staying. He tells her they are hiding out among the crowd and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. Back with Clay, she asks if he has a gun and when he says, sure do, she invites him back home tonight. As Cat dances toward the stage, we see its Sam calling the dance, and Sunrise at the piano. Cat spins to Jackson and compliments him on his dancing. He says he danced on the reservation : buffalo dance, rain dance, and then looking back at the cowboys glowering at them, says, war dance. They dance away and the men step onto the floor, accosting Jackson. The chief glowerer calls Jackson, Low, and pokes Jackson on the chest. Jackson shrugs and says its ""Custers Last Stand all over again"" and punches the man, which instigates an all-out brawl. Frank goes to rescue Jackson, as everyone, including Cat, join in the fight. Jackson pulls off a toupee of an opponent and gives a war whoop. Cat throws a chair at the chief glowerer, knocking him out, and gives a war whoop as well. Clay and Jed sneak around the perimeter, trying not to get involved, but are tackled and piled on by a scrum. Frank cheers on the woman he had patted on the bottom, Mabel, as she beats up a mustached man. Two kids, watching from the hayloft, throw hay at each other.Frank drives the wagon back to the ranch with Cat, Jackson, Clay and Jed. They are singing happily and drunkenly. Cat gets off and lands in Clay's arms. Frank continues singing and literally falls off the wagon, caught just in time by Clay and Jed. They carry Frank, now passed out, into the house. Jackson whispers to Cat if she thinks the pair of free-loaders will be able to stop Strawn. She assures him that they are gunmen and have a price on their heads. Clay looks around, admiring the house with its living room, kitchen... and bedroom. Cat says Clay and Jed will sleep in the barn; Jackson tosses each a blanket.Before going to bed, Cat sits at her dresser and brushes her hair. Unknown to her, Clay is hiding under her covers, and he smiles when she blows a playful kiss to the mirror. She gets in bed and Clay slowly covers her mouth to keep her from screaming. She jumps out and demands that he gets out before her father catches them, but Clay assures her that the father is out cold. He invites her back to bed to spoon and she stands on the mattress and kicks him onto the floor. He heads toward the door, but with a change in tone, Cat asks where he's going and tells him not to go. He turns and smiles, but she tells him she just needs to talk to him. As he sits at the end of the bed, she tells him her father is a wonderful man, but the town hates him, has dropped manure into his well, has made him talk to lawyers, and now has sent a gunman around to drive him off. Clay thinks she is dreaming. She assures him she saw the gunman. He plays along and says, then he will help her pack; her father can defend himself. Frustrated she says Clay is useless, and he agrees. As she buries her face in her pillow, Clay suggests since they hired a gunman, that she do the same. She looks up briefly and buries her face again. He then asks her about the kiss she made before going to bed; Cat moans in frustration. He pauses and gets up to leave. She calls him back, saying that everyone has some good in them and can't be as depraved or cowardly as they may think. He grabs her shoulders and assures her that some people in the world are exactly as depraved and cowardly as they think. He leans in for a kiss but Jed pops up at the window and asks Clay how long they are staying. Cat reminds Jed she had helped him on the train and asks if he can help her now. She asks if he can stay, that there's someone trying to kill her father. Jed says they'll stay and do what they can. Cat nods at Clay and says then they wont need him, but Clay tells Cat that Jed has never shot at a man before its against his principles. Cat is incredulous and then Jed tells her that neither has Clay. They leave.Cat picks up the Kid Shelleen novel from her nightstand, thinks a little, and sits at her desk to write a letter.Sam and Sunrise sing about the arrival of a fast gun into town. A stagecoach pulls up outside the telegraph office. Cat and Jackson are waiting outside. They smile happily as a tall man exits the coach, but then five kids and a woman run up to hug him. The stage drivers open the back boot flap and balled up inside is a dusty drunk old man (also Lee Marvin in a dual roll), who is the gunfighter Kid Shelleen. They tug him out and he flops onto the ground, semi-conscious. The crew drops off his valise and a paper sack, and Cat and Jackson run up to the body. Jackson rolls him over; he's still passed out. She gets the men to carry him onto their wagon. Cat grabs the sack and gets in the back of the wagon with the man, Jackson retrieves the valise, and as Sam and Sunrise sing about ""the fastest gun you've ever seen"", Cat and Jackson drive off.Frank wedges a plank between the clapboards of his barn and draws a chalk circle on it. He walks back a few paces and we see Cat, Jackson, Clay and Jed as Frank demands Kid Shelleen shows him what Cat got for the $50 she laid out, now that hes had a few hours to sleep it off. Kid gets up, squares off, and reaches for his gun, but he doesn't have one he hocked it for drink money. Frank yells at Cat for wasting the money and for the possibility that the ill-spent $50 worth of drink could have killed the man. Cat says she didnt know he was a drunk, and at that, Kid turns to look at Cat, sadly. Clay steps up and hands Kid a revolver. Kid can barely hold the gun steady. Frank guesses that Kid would rather have a drink than a poke in the eye. Kid gets a shot off but hits the weather vane on top of the roof. Clay points out that Kid actually missed the barn. Kid rushes up to Frank, who recoils at Kids breath, and begs him for a nip to steady his hand. Frank asks Jackson if hes carrying the bottle he uses to get the sheriff mad. Kid takes a swig, and then another, and keeps the bottle when Jackson tries to take it back. In between more swigs, he tells them his recent history, including that he worked the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. He shoots and hits the circle on Franks plank, twice; a tin can on top of a trellis; and another tin can on another trellis, and then again as it flies off the trellis. Cat and the men are impressed. Kid almost finishes Jackson's bottle, and tosses it in the air, but when he tries to pull the gun from the front of his pants, his pants fall halfway down, he stumbles, and asks where the bottle went. Cat looks dejected. Kid rattles off some gunslinger philosophy. Cat tries to defend Kid, but Frank tells her to keep Kid away from him, and stomps away. Cat asks Kid where he will go now, and he replies that shes paid him, so he intends to stay. Cat says Kid will sleep in the barn. Clay takes back his gun. Jackson offers to carry Kid's valise, and Kid asks him how many are in the opposition. Jackson says, one, Tim Strawn, and at hearing that name, Kid rears back and stumbles away. He bends down to pick up Jackson's bottle and asks if Jackson is sure. When Jackson says, yes, Kid finishes the bottle.At lunch, Cat laments that Kid is in no condition to defend her father, and asks Jackson, Clay and Jed to stay by Franks side. They agree. Frank walks through the kitchen on his way out and the men get up and walk out with him. Cat yells at them not to let Frank out of their sight. Outside, with the men shadowing him, Frank says Cat is crazy, like her late mother, and tells the men that theres no one around to bother him. As he marches off, a shot rings out and Frank falls. In the distance Strawn, on horseback, points a rifle at them, and tells them to drop their gun belts. Cat rushes up to Frank who is dead. Strawn rides off and Cat gets on her horse and follows. The men retrieve their gun belts and follow as well.Cat makes it to town and finds Strawn sitting on a rocking chair outside the saloon. The Sheriff and a few men are standing nearby. Cat accuses Strawn of being a murderer, but the corrupt Sheriff lies by saying that's not possible since Strawn had been sitting right there all morning. The men with him agree. Understanding the situation, Cat angrily pounces on Strawn but is pulled back by Jackson, Clay and Jed. She takes Clays revolver from his belt and tries to shoot Strawn, but in the struggle misses wildly. Strawn pulls his own gun but looks around, knowing he is being baited. Defiantly, Cat tells the Sheriff that he won't make her cry, and turns to Strawn and says the same to him.As the sun sets, and as Cat and the men ride back home, Sam and Sunrise sing that there are teardrops in Cats heart, but they cant make her cry.As they come up to the house, most of her furniture has been moved outside and a man is sitting on the front porch who tells her that this is private property, pointing at a sign proclaiming, 'Property of Wolf City Development Corp. No Trespassing'. Cat pushes her way in and sees two undertakers standing next to Frank lying in a pine box. She demands to know why Frank has a smile on his face as hes never smiled before. The undertaker says its free, courtesy of the Wolf City Development Corp. She shoves them out. A man with a rifle comes up and tells Cat that they've dug a grave behind the barn and that they will stay to make sure that Cat and her men leave before morning.Cat says she doesn't want the ranch now that Frank is dead, but she wants Wolf City to know that she intends to make Shermans March look like a bird walk.Jed points out to Clay that Cat wont have a place to stay and Clay suggests they take her with them to Hole-in-the-Wall. However, Clay's not sure they will let her in, or even let him and Jed in. Cat brightens to the idea, saying that all they need is to be outlaws, and Clay and Jed have a price on their heads, so they are outlaws. Clay agrees, hesitantly.Kid stumbles in, drunk, saying that he's ready, and that anyone who tries to get Frank will have to go through him first. Jed directs his attention to Frank in the box, but Kid notices the candelabras around the coffin and starts singing Happy Birthday. Kid blows out the candles.The next morning, Cat and the men ride off as Sam and Sunrise sing about the beginning of the Legend of Cat Ballou. As Clay and Jed, riding behind Cat, admire her from behind. They are towing a riderless horse, which is pulling a litter with Kid lying down. Jackson, reaching down from his horse, hands Kid a bottle, which Kid bobbles and drops.They ride up on Hole-in-the-Wall and are met with kids scurrying to their mothers, and men patrolling the streets, carrying rifles. Kid sits up from the litter, sniffing, and says he smells a water hole its the town saloon. Kid stumbles in and yells for the bartender. Kid is recognized by the bartender, an aged, worn-out Butch Cassidy (Arthur Hunnicutt), knocked down the ladder of life by the cavalry and the Pinkertons and the changing West. Kid suggests they have a drink for old times sake which Cassidy knows means that Kid has no money. Kid offers him his guns in exchange, but Cassidy says the guns aren't worth anything, anymore; no one cares.Cat and the men are at a table. As Kid sits down with them, Clay is talking to Jed about getting back in to business. He thinks they will need more men and asks Jackson if he is interested in helping them rustle 50 head of cattle. Kid interrupts, asking if anyone wants to buy a round and continues to interrupt them, saying hell drink to that, after each point of conversation. Cat, reading a newspaper, says she is against their plan for raising money and suggests they rob a train. Clay and Jed ignore her and get back to talking rustling. Cat interrupts and points at an article about how 200 local men were recently hired to build a slaughterhouse and these men will need to be paid. She thinks there will be at least $1,000 to $2,000 in each payroll. Clay says that shes out of her mind -- they are rustlers, not train robbers. Jed waxes philosophical and urges her to get off the path of revenge.Cat pulls out her Kid Shelleen novel and flips to Kid Shelleens own plan to rob a train. Kid perks up at hearing of the plan HIS plan. As she reads, the men bow their heads and she becomes upset at their reluctance. She reminds them that they had said they love her and had promised to take care of her, but now she is only asking them to rob one little train and they turn on her. Cat runs outside and they follow. She picks up rocks and throws them at the men, calling them a horse ranch Indian, a drunken gunfighter, a sex maniac, and an uncle. As she continues to throw rocks, she calls them Clay Boone and his band of chicken rustlers. Jed says they never said, no. He asks her to stop crying and that they will do it for her. Kid, standing at the saloon door, wonders about the plan.A train rumbles through the countryside. Jed, sitting in a passenger car, checks his watch and walks out the back to another car. It is a well-appointed private car and there is a man (Reginald Denny) and his valet. The British-accented man is sitting in a bathtub. Jed says hes looking for the baggage car, and the man, miffed, directs him back forward. Jed exits and climbs up to the roof of the passenger car he had exited. Jed walks forward, making a lot of noise. Inside the baggage compartment at the front of the car, Cat, dressed in mourning clothes, leaning over a coffin, starts wailing loudly to keep the baggage employee distracted from Jed's noise. Jed climbs down and unhitches the passenger cars from the locomotive. The locomotive rumbles ahead without the cars, which slow down. Jackson and Kid are sitting on their horses, watching the whole situation from a distance. Kid takes a swig, but Jackson takes the bottle and admonishes him they have a job to do. They ride down to the tracks with two riderless horses in tow.Jed pulls the handbrake, causing packages in the baggage compartment to tumble around, and the water to slosh out of the Englishmans bathtub. As the baggage employee helps Cat up, a knock comes from the coffin. The employee backs away in fright as Cat looks heavenward and happily says, hes alive! Cat opens the coffin and Clay climbs out. With Cat nudging him, Clay pulls out his gun and holds it on the employee. Jed climbs into the baggage compartment as Jackson and Kid watch over the passengers. The Englishman walks in with a towel around his waist, demanding to speak to the person in charge. Kid says, he is, and that the train is being robbed. The Englishman demands they hurry it up because he is taking a bath. Kid pulls off the mans towel and the man scurries off.Ahead, the engineer notices his cars have been detached and reverses the locomotive. Jed finds the trains safe and Cat demands the employee open it. The man says no. Clay reminds him he as a gun, but the employee says that Clay will have to use it. Cat and the men huddle and whisper about what they are going to do. Kid walks up to the baggage compartment and sees the locomotive coming back. Kid asks whats wrong, and Clay tells him the employee wont open the safe and would rather die. Kid asks the man if thats true, and then shoots the mans hat off. The man immediately tells them the combination.Clay notes there's more than the one or two thousand dollars Cat predicted, in fact, there's probably $50,000. The locomotive backs into the cars and causes Cat and the men to fall over, and the Englishman's bathtub to slosh out water again. The engineer drives the re-attached train forward, causing the Englishman to fall out of the tub in a big splash. Jackson rides beside the train, towing the horses. Kid sees him and jumps off the train onto Jackson's horse. Clay urges Cat and Jed to jump, and they do, with the bag of money. They land safely and Cat whoops and hugs the men. Jackson and Kid ride up and Cat praises Kid for his plan. Kid waves his hand at Jackson and Jackson hands him the bottle. Clay asks Kid how the plan in the dime novel wound up, and Kid, taking a swig, says they ride off separately and meet back at Hole-in-the-Wall. Cat heads off, with Clay following her, and Jed following them. Jackson watches Kid finish the bottle.Kid tips off his horse and the horse gallops away as Kid drunkenly hangs off the saddle half-horizontally. Jackson follows and they ride past Sam and Sunrise who sing about Cat masterminding the train robbery.The train pulls into the next town and the conductor tells the sheriff what happened and he in turn rounds up a posse which rides off after Cat and her band of desperados. As they head out into the brush, Jackson and Kid, still uncontrolled on his horse, ride up behind the posse. Jackson grabs Kids reins and turns them back around. The posse follows. They split up and the posse divides in half to follow Jackson and Kid. Jackson catches up to Kid and they resume their escape.Back at Hole-in-the-Wall, Kid storms in to the saloon and boasts about their exploits to Cassidy. He notices, worriedly, that Cat and the men aren't there. They come in, elated, but Kid asks Cat why they were delayed and if Clay had bothered her. Clay says they were losing the posse; Jed says he was doing his job. Clay laughs to Jed that Kid is jealous. Kid grabs Clay by the shirt and tells him that Clay has no respect. Cat separates them and Clay tells Cassidy to get Kid a drink. Cassidy asks if they really did it and Cat proudly says that they did, her gang. She says they are going to wipe out Wolf City. She tells Cassidy that theres more where that came from and if they help her, there will be more for them. Cassidy picks up a money sack and reads the inscription : Wolf City Development, Property H. Percival. Cassidy tells Cat that Sir Harry Percival owns Wolf City Development, which owns Wolf City, which lets Hole-in-the-Wall alone. Cat decides that she should go after Percival and asks Cassidy to help. He refuses, as that would be cutting their own throats. Dejected, she tells Cassidy that Hole-in-the-Wall had the reputation for harboring cutthroats and murderers; that they used to whisper their names when they were kids scared to say them out loud. She scoffs they got old and walks out. Clay follows her.As she walks contemplatively in a copse of trees, Clay comes up behind Cat and surprises her. He grabs her and kisses her. He tells her they should go to Saint Louis now that they got the money, but she says now that Wolf City is desperate, she should continue her plan. They kiss and she tells him she thinks she loves him. He laughs it off; that she's being too serious. She says he's not as cowardly as he thinks he is, that he may be selfish and a little stupid, but not cowardly. She says she sees his faults but loves him anyway. He says he sees trouble, pointing toward the direction of the posse, and then, saying in Cats eyes as well. He says hes not going to be tied down by a girl and that he's going to Saint Louis. He warns her that shes going to get herself killed. He walks off, saying he never promised he was going to be a hero. She yells back that hes not a hero and tells him to leave. He says bye and walks off.Jackson has overheard some of their conversation and comes up to Cat. She asks what is happening. He tells her that when the gods decide to make a man crazy, that they just made him fall in love. She discounts that, wondering who is falling in love with whom. She asks Jackson if he will stay, and he says he likes being on the winning side for a change. He walks away.Cat continues her walk and Strawn rides up and tells her Sir Harry wants his money back. He adds that if she wasn't a girl, that he'd split her like a chicken. She screams as he rides off. Jackson, Jed and Kid run up. Jackson and Jed console Cat as Kid stares after Strawn. Kid calls Jackson over and tells him to find his valise and to get a case of cartridges from Cassidy. As Jackson runs off, Kid walks over to Cat and assures her everything will be okay.Kid decides to become sober and clean himself up for his confrontation with Strawn. As Kid rubs his trembling hands together, Jackson brings him the valise. Kid does some sit-ups. Jackson massages the Kid's back as the Kid tests the steadiness of his hands. Kid practices his quick draw -- at first Jackson is able to clap before Kid can level his gun, but Kid gets faster as they go. Kid shoots at cans and bottles that Jackson tosses in the air. He hits every one. Jackson asks Kid if he wants a drink, but Kid tells him, ""no booze"". Jackson adds water as Kid takes a steaming bath. Kid shaves with a straight razor.Jackson opens the valise and takes out a girdle. Jackson helps Kid, standing in front of a full-length mirror in his long johns, get into the girdle. As Jackson helps him with his shirt, Kid looks at his hand; it is steady. Kid has silvery garters for his shirt sleeves and a matching vest. Jackson helps him with his gun belt with a garish silver buckle. Kid holsters his shiny guns. Jackson helps him put on his hat with a silver hat band. Kid is now sober and dressed in his finest.Sam and Sunrise are singing and play piano at a brothel. Kid comes in, spurs jangling, and goes upstairs. He walks down the hall, opening each door, only to be greeted by a woman's scream... and then a mans scream, where Kid does a double-take. At the last door, he finds Strawn. Strawn, sitting, says ""it's been a long time"". Kid notices Strawn's silver nose and strap on the dresser. Strawn asks Kid if he's there for money or for a job. Kid squares up. Strawn stands and notes that there's never been any love lost between them. Strawn goes for his gun, but Kid says he cant, and turns away. Strawn draws anyway, Kid kneels down and draws. In the drawing room, the Englishman is being entertained by three prostitutes. We hear the gun shot.Back at the Hole-in-the-Wall saloon, a black clad man with a silver nose barges in. Cat shrieks, but its Kid. He takes off the nose and twirls it by the strap. He happily kicks back in a chair and says it was just swell. Kid says that even when they were kids, Strawn would always sneak around and shoot kids in the back, and he thinks Strawn thought Kid was still on the booze. Cat is surprised that Kid and Strawn used to play together as kids. Kid says that he and Strawn are twin brothers; Cat, Jackson and Jed are shocked. Kid continues to reminisce and says he took Strawn just like the dime novel said.Clay busts in and says that Kid has brought the roof down; that half of Wolf City is on its way to Hole-in-the-Wall. Kid looks at Cat and assures her they can take them like they did last time. Clay continues and says that Percival has added at least fifty of his own goons. Kid grabs Clay by the arm and demands that he try to remember if the men were professionals or just barroom sweeps. Clay describes them as professionals. Kid says that with Strawn dead, they might as well be sweeps. Clay warns that Strawn was just a hired hand, and that these men are an army. He grabs Cat and says he's taking her out of there. Cat asks Clay if hes sure about the men. As he embraces Cat, Kid says if Percival wants a fight, then they'll give him one he and Cat Ballou. Clay accuses Kid of wanting to die. Kid says he's done everything he's wanted to do and been everywhere he's wanted to go. He says he and Cat can make history. Clay accuses Kid of trying to get Cat killed. Kid says its better than dying in a dirty hotel, or off somewhere drunk a fate he was always afraid of for himself until Cat came along. Cat tenderly tells Kid that there are places she wants to see and things she wants to do.Clay says now she is making sense, that they can now go to Saint Louis. She rejects him. He suggests Sioux Falls. She rejects him again. He asks if shes afraid to be seen with him that he will marry her. Cat is indignant that he thinks THAT is what a woman wants a man to say or do in order to save her. She runs out.Kid glares at Clay and says he's been studying her and now realizes that Cat loves Clay, not himself. He also realizes Clay had been laughing at him the whole time and says that he will make Clay do the right thing. Kid circles the table, grabs a chair and smashes it into little pieces. Jed and Jackson grab Clay and hold him away from Kid. Kid proposes guns, bottles, fists, knives, clubs, they're all the same to him. Clay doesn't know what Kid is talking about. Kid demands he marry Cat. Clay says he would, but Cat won't. Kid philosophizes that ""at first you can't stand to get hit, but then you realize you CAN take it, because the blood doesn't matter and you know you're going to live"". Kid tells Clay that he's giving Clay a gift to know that it doesn't hurt to fight. Kid chases Clay around the saloon and roundhouses him into Jed. Jed punches Clay into a chair, saying that Clay is kin and has been a millstone around his neck all his life. Clay stumbles to Kid, realizes what he is doing, and stumbles toward Jackson, who also punches him, saying everyone else was doing it and he shouldn't be excluded for reasons of race, creed or color according to the Fourteenth Amendment. Cassidy pops his head in and asks if he can have his saloon back now that Cat is leaving. They all rush to the window to see her riding off.Cat, dressed like a prostitute, calls on Percivals private railroad car. The valet introduces her as a consolation from the town. Percival is beside himself. She takes off her stole, revealing a low-cut dress, and hands it to the valet who scurries off. Percival asks if she wants a drink and he calls the valet to bring it. She says her name is Trixie and says shes never seen a train car like this and he shows her the bedroom. The valet brings champagne and Percival dismisses him for the evening.Percival turns to put on a phonograph and to dim the lights and when he turns back around, Cat has a gun on him. She re-introduces herself as Catherine, Frank Ballous daughter. He is not impressed. She produces a rolled up piece of paper from her bodice and demands that he signs it. Its a confession, saying that he hired Strawn to kill Frank. He asks what if he doesn't sign, and she says shell kill him. He is still not impressed. He doubts she has it in her, and goes for the gun. They struggle and the gun goes off; Percival falls dead.CURRENT TIMEBack outside the town jail, Cat, in her white dress, watches through her window as the temperance women continue to sing. The crowd outside is now much larger. The Sheriff, standing outside her cell, has been eyeing his pocket watch, and happily declares it is time. Cat looks out the window again and says she's sorry the people do not like her. The Sheriff says its understandable, since her killing Percival ended the plans for the slaughterhouse, so now there are no jobs, and no payroll. He continues that she took the bread out of the mouths of half of Wolf City; and that she doesnt have a friend in the world. The Sheriff calls for the reverend. As he blurts out a few nonsensical bible verses, Cat recognizes it is Jed.... dressed once again in his parson's disguise. He leads her out of the cell.Meanwhile, Jackson, dressed like an undertaker, runs up and sees Kid on his horse, both slumped against the jail house wall... drunk once again. Jackson is disappointed that Kid chose this time to fall of the wagon and that they are all counting on him. Kid waves him off.Jed walks Cat through the jeering crowd. The temperance women are singing Rock of Ages. On the gallows are the Sheriff and a few men including the hangman and Jed. The Sheriff tells the crowd to quiet, and asks Cat for her last words. She says, ""Let's get on with it"". The Sheriff gives the signal and the hangman puts the noose around Cat's neck. She looks back at Jed but he just looks away. Under the gallows, in the coffin intended for Cats body, Clay lifts the lid and peeks out. Jackson, sitting on the horse-drawn hearse next to the gallows, looks back and sees Kid in the same position he was before. The Sheriff gives the signal and a man pulls the lever. Cat falls. Jed has produced a razor from his fake bible and cuts the rope. Clay is under the trapdoor and catches Cat in his arms. Jackson has the side door to the hearse open, and Clay helps Cat inside; he follows her. Jed jumps off the gallows onto the roof of the hearse and sits down next to Jackson. They ride off. Jed asks Jackson where Kid is, but Jackson shakes his head. As they drive down the main street, men with rifles follow, and Kid finally rides into view, half-horizontally again. He shoots randomly causing a banner to fall and tangle up a man on a horse. Another shot frightens some draft horses that run off and spill their load of beer casks, which causes the road to become slippery, and other riders to slip and fall. One of the casks pops its cork near Kids horse, spooks the horse, which carries Kid, half-horizontally, out of town.Sam and Sunrise sing that where Cat rode off to is a mystery, but that she's made history, and that her legend continues to grow.The hearse rides off into the mountains with Kid, half-horizontally on his horse, following. Jackson, sitting next to Jed, takes off his undertakers top hat and happily puts on his own. Cat and Clay, looking out the back of the hearse, kiss.THE END

However, his operatives have been hunted down and killed by Mundt, the head of East German counter-espionage. Leamas himself is present at Checkpoint Charlie near the Berlin Wall when he witnesses the last of his agents, Karl Riemeck, being killed as he attempts to escape to the West.Leamas is recalled to London by Control, the head of the ""Circus"" (slang for MI6, the British Intelligence service). Control makes little secret of the fact that he sees Leamas' career as over, however he is willing to keep him on for one last operation: to destroy Mundt, something which Leamas is only too happy to do.Leamas is later seen apparently out of the service and unemployed. He gets a job at a reference library and starts an affair with Nan Perry, another librarian and a member of the British communist party. Leamas gives the impression of a bitter, broken man and an alcoholic. He later assaults a grocer and spends time in prison.After his release from jail, Leamas is approached by a man called Ashe who claims to be part of a charity that supports ex-convicts. Leamas is quick to realise that Ashe and his associate Carlton are East German agents who want him to defect and provide information. Still a heavy drinker and desperate for money, he agrees.Leamas later visits George Smiley, another leading official in the ""Circus"", and there he meets Control who briefs him on what he is to tell the Germans. Leamas' defection is part of a long-term plan hatched by the British that will lead the East Germans to believe that Mundt is a traitor and will be executed by his own side.Travelling on a false passport, Leamas goes to Holland where he meets Peters, an East German Intelligence official. Leamas tells Peters about what he knows about the ""Circus"" and specifically about Operation ""Rolling Stone"" during which he made payments into Danish and Finnish banks under a false name. The money was later taken out by a ""business partner"", actually an agent working behind the Iron Curtain. Leamas later reads a newspaper article which shows that he is wanted by the police in England. He has no choice now but to agree to actually go to East Germany itself and is taken there by Peters.Leamas arrives at a compound where he meets Fiedler, Mundt's deputy in counter-espionage. It's well known that there is little love lost between Mundt, an ex-Nazi, and Fiedler, who is a Jew. Fiedler questions Leamas further about ""Rolling Stone"" and suggests that it was all about secret payments to a spy even higher up in the East German government than Karl Riemeck, who worked for the Presidium of the East German Communist Party. Leamas himself rejects this theory on the grounds that, as head of British Intelligence operations in Germany, he would have been told about all the agents working there.Meanwhile in London, Leamas' girlfriend Nan Perry is visited by George Smiley who claims to be a friend of Leamas. She is later invited to East Germany as part of an exchange program between the British and East German Communist Parties.One night, Fiedler and Leamas return to the compound where they are arrested by Mundt himself. However, Fiedler has already reported his own findings to the Presidium and Mundt is himself later arrested as a spy for the British.A secret tribunal is convened to determine Mundt's guilt. At the hearing, Fiedler outlines his case: in 1959, Mundt was part of a trading mission in London, a cover for intelligence work. He killed a man and escaped under the noses of the authorities. Fiedler claims that his escape was too easy and that he only got away when he agreed to supply information to the British, for which he was paid. Fiedler also points out that Karl Riemeck, a proven spy, rose high in the East German civil service thanks to Mundt, thus enabling them to gain access to secrets. When Riemeck came under suspicion, Mundt had him killed to protect himself. Another point is that the money from the bank accounts set up by Leamas in Helsinki and Copenhagen was withdrawn at times when Mundt is known to have been in those cities.When Leamas is asked to give evidence he again rejects the idea that Mundt was a spy for Britain because he - Leamas - would have been told. In answer to Mundt's lawyer, he denies ever meeting George Smiley.Mundt's lawyer, Karden, claims Leamas was set up by his boss, Control, to defect in order to frame Mundt and get him executed. He further reveals that Mundt's agents actually followed Leamas during his last days in London and that, although he gave them the slip, it was in the neighbourhood of George Smiley's residence.Leamas' girlfriend, Nan Perry, then appears in the court, having been lured to East Germany. Without knowing exactly what is going on, she is quizzed over her involvement. It's revealed that she now owns the lease on her rented flat due to an anonymous benefactor and that she was visited there by George Smiley. Karden persuades the court that Leamas did meet Smiley before he left London and set in motion a plan to discredit Mundt.In an attempt to try and get Nan out of trouble, Leamas quickly steps forward and admits that Karden is right about the British plan. Mundt is cleared and Fiedler and Leamas are arrested. Although Leamas hoped to get her released, Nan is also taken into custody.Leamas is taken back to his cell, but later hears the door being unlocked. Making his way out of the building to a back exit he meets Mundt. Nan is also there waiting next to a car. Mundt gives Leamas instructions on how to get to East Berlin and meet a contact who will get him over the Wall. His escape will give Mundt extra excuses to purge Fiedler and his associates and have them executed.During the journey by car, Leamas tells a confused Nan what's really been going on, the truth that he himself has only just realised: Mundt is a spy for the British and Fiedler was closing in on him. Rather than just have Fiedler killed, Smiley and Control decided to discredit him and his evidence as well. Leamas was used to make Fiedler's case and Nan to undermine it. Thus Fiedler will die for trying to incriminate a senior intelligence officer and Mundt will be able to resume his work as a double agent.When Nan berates him for causing the execution of Fiedler who was guilty of nothing, Leamas tells her that London needs Mundt in order to protect the West and the freedoms people like her take for granted:""What the hell do you think spies are? Moral philosophers measuring everything they do against the word of God or Karl Marx? They're not. They're just a bunch of seedy, squalid bastards like me. Little men, drunkards, queers, hen-pecked husbands, civil servants playing cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten little lives. Do you think they sit like monks in a cell, balancing right against wrong? Yesterday I would've killed Mundt because I thought him evil and an enemy, but not today. Today he's evil and my friend. London needs him. They need him so that the great moronic masses you admire so much can sleep soundly in their flea-bitten beds again. They need him for the safety of ordinary crummy people like you and me."" He also points out that her own Communist beliefs have their own share of evils: ""There's a few million bodies on that path.""In East Berlin, Leamas and Nan meet a contact who directs them to a section of the Wall over which they can escape to the West. But as they climb over it, the contact takes aim with a rifle and kills Nan, who now knows too much about Mundt to be kept alive.A shocked Leamas sees Nan collapse to the bottom of the Wall on the Eastern side. At that moment, Smiley himself calls from the Western side for Leamas to hurry and get over the Wall. Leamas instead climbs back down to the East German side and goes to Nan's lifeless body where he himself is shot dead.","

There his boss, Control, enquires if he is tired, burnt out, ready to come in from the cold. Control suggests that there is a vacancy, a desk job, that might interest him, but Alec declines adamantly. Thus, Control immediately mentions that he has something out of the ordinary in mind for a man called Hans-Dieter Mundt, who in 1959 posed as a member of an East German steel mission.

                    Alec Leamas is the operative for the British Secret Service overseeing the field agents and their activities in Berlin. Recent activities in the field in Berlin and Alec's long term status in the position make his London based boss, Control, openly wonder if Alec is burnt out and thus needs to come in from the cold to a London based desk job. Alec's deteriorating state of mind is what Control wants the enemies to believe as he asks Alec to do one last job out in the field. Alec is to pretend to become a drunkard due to his disillusionment with the job, working whatever odd desk jobs outside of the inner circle. This change in attitude would make Alec ripe for turning information to the enemies. What Alec is supposed to do is implicate a purely East German spy, Hans-Dieter Mundt, as a double agent to the East Germans, leading to Mundt being murdered by his own, the Brits expecting the one figuratively to pull the trigger being Mundt's second in command, an East German Jew named Fiedler, who hates his boss. Beyond the regular dangers in Alec being found out or Mundt being able to convince his masters of his innocence, Alec faces one initially unintended obstacle, namely his relationship with a woman named Nan Perry. Alec met her during one of those office jobs, she openly a member of the British Communist Party, but one who, in her idealistic state, saw herself as drunkard Alec's savior. Alec wants to keep her out of what is occurring, which may be difficult as both sides, while watching Alec's movements, will see their involvement with each other.

Leamas travels to London to meet his Chief Control. They have a meeting and Control asks him to lure the East Germans to make them believe that their agent Mundt is a double agent and use the Jewish agent Fiedler, who is under the command of Mundt and hates him, to expose Mundt to get rid off him. Leamas poses as alcoholic defector without any pension who finds a job in a library. Soon he becomes the lover of Nan Perry, who works with him in the library and belongs to the Communist Party. Leamas is arrested for fighting in a store and when he is discharged from jail, an East German agent recruits him and they travel to the Netherlands. Then they travel to East Germany where Leamas meets Fiedler who uses his information to accuse Mundt. They go to a tribunal and out of the blue, Mundt's attorney summons a mysterious witness.

His escape will give Mundt extra excuses to purge Fiedler and his associates and have them executed.During the journey by car, Leamas tells a confused Nan what's really been going on, the truth that he himself has only just realised: Mundt is a spy for the British and Fiedler was closing in on him. Rather than just have Fiedler killed, Smiley and Control decided to discredit him and his evidence as well. Leamas was used to make Fiedler's case and Nan to undermine it. Thus Fiedler will die for trying to incriminate a senior intelligence officer and Mundt will be able to resume his work as a double agent.When Nan berates him for causing the execution of Fiedler who was guilty of nothing, Leamas tells her that London needs Mundt in order to protect the West and the freedoms people like her take for granted:""What the hell do you think spies are? Moral philosophers measuring everything they do against the word of God or Karl Marx? They're not. They're just a bunch of seedy, squalid bastards like me. Little men, drunkards, queers, hen-pecked husbands, civil servants playing cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten little lives. Do you think they sit like monks in a cell, balancing right against wrong? Yesterday I would've killed Mundt because I thought him evil and an enemy, but not today. Today he's evil and my friend. London needs him. They need him so that the great moronic masses you admire so much can sleep soundly in their flea-bitten beds again. They need him for the safety of ordinary crummy people like you and me."" He also points out that her own Communist beliefs have their own share of evils: ""There's a few million bodies on that path.""In East Berlin, Leamas and Nan meet a contact who directs them to a section of the Wall over which they can escape to the West. But as they climb over it, the contact takes aim with a rifle and kills Nan, who now knows too much about Mundt to be kept alive.A shocked Leamas sees Nan collapse to the bottom of the Wall on the Eastern side. At that moment, Smiley himself calls from the Western side for Leamas to hurry and get over the Wall. Leamas instead climbs back down to the East German side and goes to Nan's lifeless body where he himself is shot dead.

                    Michael James, the British editor of a Paris fashion magazine, is in love with ESL teacher Carole Werner, but despite Carole and her parents' want for them to get married, Michael just isn't ready to give up his womanizing ways for Carole. In Michael's own words, he has been cursed all his life by ""looking almost handsome when the light shines on him in a certain way"" and thus becomes the object of desire for most women who see him in that light, such as unbalanced exotic dancer Liz Bien and a parachutist named Rita. Michael is seeing Austrian therapist Dr. Fritz Fassbender to help him with his problem, unaware that Dr. Fassbender will probably be of little help as he secretly aspires to Michael's life. Despite being married, Dr. Fassbender most specifically lusts after one of his patients, Renée Lefebvre, who only has eyes for another. Because Michael won't give her a commitment, Carole takes up with Michael's neurotic friend, Victor, who in turn truly loves her despite also aspiring to be more like Michael. All their romantic entanglements come to a head as they all convene - some by accident, some on purpose - on the Chateau Chantel for the weekend.

Once there, Pat learns that Mrs. Trefoile is a devoutly religious woman who lives by an extremely strict moral code. But Pat quickly comes to the realization that Mrs. Trefoile's need to adhere to that moral code is fanatical.

                    Professional daredevil and white-suited hero, The Great Leslie, convinces turn-of-the-century auto makers that a race from New York to Paris (westward across America, the Bering Straight and Russia) will help to promote automobile sales. Leslie's arch-rival, the mustached and black-attired Professor Fate vows to beat Leslie to the finish line in a car of Fate's own invention.

                    In the early twentieth century, the Great Leslie - daredevil and all 'round Renaissance man always clad in white - has several world records to his name in daring feats of courage, always with the faithful Hezekiah by his side. Leslie's arch enemy is the dastardly Professor Fate - always clad in black - who is always trying either to outdo Leslie or thwart Leslie's attempts of daring, without success. Leslie suggests to the Webber Motor Car Company that they show their engineering expertise by building the supreme motor car for a New York to Paris race, that car which they ultimately name the Leslie Special after their inspiration. Not to be outdone, Fate, with his equally dastardly sidekick Max, also enters the race with what he considers his motor car masterpiece, the Hannibal Twin-8. Nothing is too dastardly an act in Fate's goal of winning. One of the other entries is the beautiful Maggie Dubois, a reporter covering the race for the New York Sentinel newspaper. An emancipated woman, Maggie initially tried to convince both Leslie and Fate to use her as their driving partner, both who refused, considering her among the weaker sex. Maggie however convinced the newspaper both to hire her and to sponsor their own car with her as the driver based on the internal struggle within the newspaper's ownership, which is similar to Maggie's own struggles. Maggie expects to win: in her logic, she is covering the entire race (which she does with the use of some primitive but effective technology), meaning she needs to be first at the finish line. Despite being emancipated, Maggie is not averse to using her feminine wiles to her advantage. Through the race, they come across a few adventures and obstacles. But being a long race with much interaction between the racers, their mindsets and priorities may change based on their time together.

"20","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059309/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The story opens on the night of December 6, 1941, at a dance in the Officers' Club at Pearl Harbor. We are at first introduced to Lieutenant (j.g.) William 'Mac' McConnel (Tom Tryon) and his wife Beverly (Paula Prentiss), who can't help but notice a visibly inebriated Liz Eddington (Barbara Bouchet) dancing with an Army Air Corps major (Hugh O'Brian) - spiting her husband who is at sea on gunnery practice. When the band launches into an upbeat swing tune, Liz engages in an exotic dance that for better or for worse draws the attention of every person in the club. Mac finally asks the band to make an end and play something else, which is heeded to Liz's disappointment. Her lover escorts her from the premises and takes her to spend the rest of the night on a beach near the base.Morning breaks over the unnamed heavy cruiser commanded by Captain Rockwell 'Rock' Torrey (John Wayne), who is nonplussed to find that his executive officer, Liz's husband Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas), has overslept reveille, the latest of a number of blemishes on his record that (along with his mounting alcoholism) can be laid to his unhappy marriage. He tells Eddington to 'fish or cut bait' and gives him one last chance to pull himself together. Eddington apologizes for his conduct, but is left wondering what Liz has gotten herself into in recent hours.In Pearl Harbor, Mac reports for duty as Officer of the Day on his destroyer, the U.S.S. Cassiday. With some consternation, he reads a radio dispatch from the destroyer U.S.S. Ward, which has depth-charged an unidentified submarine contact much too close to Pearl for comfort. Torrey's ship has received the same message; he orders alert status, then general quarters when one of his lookouts sights several large formations of planes flying over Oahu. The Japanese surprise attack is only minutes away. One formation flies over and strafes the beach where Liz Eddington and her lover are awakening, and they make a hasty escape back towards Pearl. As they hurtle around a curve, a truck barrels toward them in the wrong lane from the opposite direction, and the head-on collision sends them both plunging in flames off a cliff to their deaths.As nearly 350 Japanese aircraft descend on Pearl Harbor, an emergency sortie signal is sent to all ships; Mac, without waiting for his C.O. or further instructions, orders the Cassiday with cool-headed authority to get underway at once. The captain and executive officer give chase aboard a torpedo retriever, but Mac, knowing any attempt to stop and bring them aboard will render the Cassiday a sitting duck, ignores their shouts and plows out of the harbor at high speed. The Cassiday is one of not a dozen cruisers and destroyers to escape the harbor as the battleships and aircraft are decimated by the Japanese planes, much to the dismay of Admiral Kimmel (Franchot Tone), once he receives a situation report from his flag lieutenant.Torrey, meanwhile, gives orders for all outbreaking ships to group with his cruiser and reports his force strength to headquarters. It is a woefully small squadron of four cruisers and eight destroyers, a sneeze at a typhoon. Vice Admiral B.T. Broderick (Dana Andrews) urges Kimmel to position the force against a possible invasion, but Kimmel decides instead to have Torrey seek out and engage the Japanese. The orders are met with surprise and some anticipation by Torrey and his officers, who request underway refueling the following day. The morning of December 8 brings them nothing but an empty fleet oiler heading for home, leaving the task group without enough fuel to last half the day. Weighing his options, Torrey decides to cease zigzagging despite the known submarine threat.Not long thereafter, the American force is stalked by a Japanese submarine which is detected by the Cassiday as it approaches. Mac orders pursuit and depth-charging while Torrey orders zigzagging resumed. But the submarine gets into firing position and puts two torpedoes into the cruiser, causing severe damage in the engineering section and breaking Torrey's arm when he is thrown off his feet. Eddington goes below to take charge of damage control and finds the engineering deck a shambles of fire and out-of-control flooding. As DC parties scramble to save the ship, the Cassiday continues depth-charging, reporting a positive kill. Torrey orders all ships except the Cassiday back to Pearl Harbor, and conferring with Mac by megaphone, remembers him well from his days at the Naval Academy. Eddington reports the main damage under control as Mac complies with Torrey's request for a tow.A few days later, Torrey, his arm set and casted, reports to Admiral Kimmel's office where he is relieved of command for jeopardizing his force. He is reassigned to a desk to route convoys over his contention that the admiral's orders rendered the group 'expendable'. In the meantime, Eddington has learned of Liz's death and identifies her and her belongings at the Honolulu morgue, also learning of her companion's attachment to the Army Air Corps. In a rut of shock, he goes to a bar where he is offered a drink by another AAC officer who unwittingly rubs salt in the wound. The resulting brawl lands Eddington in the brig, where Torrey later arrives to have him released. They part ways in the sight of a new cruiser going to sea to replace their drydocked vessel - a baleful metaphor for the drydocking they both face.Three months later, Torrey's arm is pronounced healed by the X-rays of a nurse lieutenant named Maggie Haynes (Patricia Neal). His roommate, Commander Egan Powell (Burgess Meredith), a reserve intelligence officer, offers to celebrate at a social gathering in the Oahu hills. There, Torrey has a chance encounter with Maggie, who startles him with news of his estranged son - Jeremiah Torrey (Brandon De Wilde), now a reserve ensign who has been dating Maggie's roommate, Annalee Dorne (Jill Haworth). Torrey confesses that he has been divorced and not seen Jere in eighteen years. By the time Maggie drives him home and advises him that she's on temporary assignment, they have taken an obvious liking to each other. Torrey discovers that Jere is attached to a PT boat squadron in Pearl and goes to visit him, where they have a strained reunion; Jere lets it slip that he is about to be reassigned to Admiral Broderick's staff in preparation for an upcoming offensive called 'Skyhook'. Jere will be assistant to former Congressman Neal Owynn (Patrick O'Neal), serving in the Naval Reserve as Broderick's public-affairs officer.After a couple of weeks, a cheerful Powell arrives at Torrey's office, quietly letting on that he has been in Washington for the past ten days. Torrey takes him to lunch, and seeing Jere and Owynn sitting at a nearby table, takes the opportunity to ask Powell about Skyhook. Powell immediately puts a top-secret lid on it but is not surprised to discover that Owynn has been doing too much talking on Broderick's behalf. That evening, Torrey and Jere run into each other at Maggie and Annalee's apartment; there Maggie and Torrey remain while Jere and Annalee go to dinner at Owynn's house. As the evening wears on, Maggie and Torrey open up about each other's past of failed marriages and occupations chosen or unchosen. In the meantime, Owynn, obliging Jere's wishes, slips silently away to allow Jere a subtle run to second base. Annalee, wary of Owynn's disappearance and Jere's advances, puts the date - and their relationship - to an abrupt end.Torrey returns to his office after several days to find Powell waiting with a 'private little job': the routing of three hot and heavy convoys to a former Free French naval base on the island of Toulebonne in the South Pacific. Torrey figures out the Skyhook strategy, and explains to Powell that Broderick could use one of three nearby islands as a staging base to hit at a large island named Levu-Vana, whose central plain would make an ideal roost for B-17 squadrons. Powell wordlessly covers up the charts and leaves. Torrey arrives home that night to find Maggie sitting on his front steps; he invites her inside, where she regretfully tells him that her unit is being shipped out. Torrey, knowing where she's headed, calls on Powell to bunk out for the night, whereupon Maggie slips her shoes off in a classic 'fade to black' scene.Three weeks find the convoys safe and sound at Toulebonne, where Paul Eddington has been stationed since January overseeing piers and warehouses. Pursuant to a written request from Torrey, he boards the nurses' transport and asks to speak to Maggie, and welcomes her and several other nurses with flower chains, a basket of bananas and a hidden bottle of liquor. Maggie introduces him to Annalee and he immediately takes a shine to her. He gives Maggie the unexpected news that the convoy is due to shove off again that night for Broderick's advance base on Gavabutu, as 'that's where they're gonna need nurses'.Back in Hawaii, Torrey visits Beverly McConnel at her civil air defense post to give her the unpleasant news that Mac is MIA. She tearfully reads him a letter from Mac, written with his morale at a critical low, describing incessant air attacks on the Cassiday and the overall poor quality of Broderick's command, which has stalled the Skyhook advance and riddled the morale of the troops. Not long afterward, Torrey is summoned to a dinner party at Admiral Nimitz's quarters - and is shocked but pleased to find that the party is in honor of his promotion to rear admiral. Admiral Nimitz (Henry Fonda) tells him that he was correct in his guess at the Skyhook strategy, and awards tactical command of the operation to Torrey, effectively displacing Broderick from the action (or lack thereof). Broderick is incensed, and agrees with Owynn's suggestion to place a 'liaison officer' on Torrey's staff to keep him discreetly informed on Torrey's intentions, naming Owynn as that officer. Eddington arrives at Broderick's headquarters (having spent the past few hours at a whorehouse), and himself receives a surprise promotion to captain and an appointment as Torrey's chief of staff.Torrey and Eddington reunite on Gavabutu three days later and meet the rest of the staff, along with Australian coastwatcher Clayton Canfil (Stanley Holloway) and a ready and willing battalion of Marine paratroops. Their base almost immediately comes under a Japanese air raid and they make a mad dash for the command shelter, where Torrey outlines his plan to divide and conquer Gavabutu in three sections. At the all-clear, the staff scatter to their duties, and Eddington surreptitiously dismisses Owynn and Jere to prevent them from listening in on a scheme to procure additional transport planes. Torrey goes to the base hospital to visit Maggie, promising her that they'll make time for each other out here.The following Sunday, the Marines parachute into an open meadow on the north side of the island as an amphibious force lands on a northwestern beach, and a battalion of Marines, led by Canfil, crosses the mountains on foot. Torrey accompanies the paramarines aloft, ordering his plane's commander on a 'sightseeing trip' to overfly the mountains and deliver a change of orders to the foot battalion. Back at his HQ, Broderick, having arrived in the company of a group of war correspondents from Toulebonne, demonstrates a too-concise knowledge of the details, leading Eddington to suspect that Owynn has been quietly feeding him information. When Torrey returns, he is informed by his operations officer that the operation is well ahead of schedule - the Japanese garrison abandoned Gavabutu the previous night, presumably to reinforce Levu-Vana. He reports as much to Broderick and the correspondents, who are frustrated with the limited information Torrey gives them. Jere, earlier confronted by Eddington about his role in ratting on his father, renounces it in his newfound respect for him. Eddington later confronts Owynn as well, coercing him through harsh physical contact into returning to Toulebonne with Broderick. Owynn threatens a court-martial, but Jere, the only witness, refuses to bear him out, choosing instead to be transferred back to PT boats and remain under his father's command.Canfil returns to HQ from his guidance of the Marine battalion, and is promptly asked by Torrey and Eddington to reconnoiter the Japanese positions on Levu-Vana. He volunteers to go ashore alone with his intimate knowledge of the island and map the enemy emplacements. He is put ashore by a submarine under cover of darkness, sneaking into a Japanese camp and eavesdropping on a sake party.The next morning, Jere, back on duty with the PT squadron, is delivering mail to the hospital when he meets Maggie and Annalee; the latter shows him to the mail room, and old flames between them are rekindled, leading to an engagement to marriage after the war. Elsewhere in the world, other flames are fanned - Mac McConnel and the survivors of the Cassiday have been rescued and returned to the States for a month of survivors' leave. Beverly meets him in a passionate reunion at the pier in San Francisco, where he announces his promotion to lieutenant commander and his post-leave assignment as Torrey's flag secretary.Back on Gavabutu, Annalee, who is accompanying Eddington and a group of other personnel to a beach party, is warned by Maggie to be cautious around him, but insists on having a little fun. Maggie's warning is well warranted, for when Annalee separates from the group to go for a swim, Eddington follows her and watches from the beach. When she emerges from the water and tells him she's engaged, his reaction is less than rational - he flings her clothes out of her reach and rapes her, out of sight of the others. In her desperate attempt to fight back, she leaves her mark on his face, and it is noticed by Powell a couple of days later when Torrey and his staff put out to the harbor to meet his old ship, which along with several other cruisers and destroyers has just anchored at Gavabutu. Eddington dismisses the mark as 'just a friendly wound.'Aboard their old cruiser, Torrey and Eddington brief the senior officers of the task group on the planned invasion of Levu-Vana when they are interrupted by Canfil, just returned from his recon mission. He has painted a grim picture of the stronghold under construction, from tanks and troops to pillboxes and a nearly-completed airfield. Then he delivers the grimmest report of all - the Japanese are assembling a task force of their own at their nearby Cape Titan base. Torrey discusses options with his staff, deciding eventually that their best choice is to try and get a long-range recon plane from Pearl Harbor.In San Francisco, Mac McConnel returns from fleet HQ with ill tidings for him and Beverly: he has orders to proceed immediately to his new assignment on Gavabutu, despite having spent less than half of his leave. Beverly bursts into tears, lamenting that she may not get him back this time, and asks him to leave her with a baby.The rains are hammering Gavabutu and vicinity when Maggie returns to her barracks to find a note addressed to her. It is from Annalee - who has overdosed on sleeping pills, fearing pregnancy from the rape and being disbelieved by Eddington. Maggie desperately attempts to rouse Annalee, but finding that it's too late, she calls Torrey, who is discussing with Eddington and Powell the failure to secure a recon plane from Pearl. At Eddington's query, Torrey somberly tells him what has happened, leaving Eddington guilt-stricken as he heads for the nurse barracks. Maggie, boiling with anger, tells him the gist of the note, and Torrey promises to tell Jere personally before telling Maggie that Skyhook is starting very soon. She flings a farewell embrace on him and rushes away, as Torrey returns to HQ with his personal matters now weighing almost as much on his mind as his command responsibilities.First thing the next morning, Eddington dashes to the airfield and orders a long-range naval bomber prepared for him; he lifts off without telling a soul. Meanwhile, Torrey heads over to the PT boat base on the other side of the island, where he tells a grief-stricken Jere about Annalee and bids him farewell. He then repairs to HQ, where Mac has just arrived from Toulebonne, and sends Powell in search of Eddington before taking in a weather forecast. At the airfield, Powell finds out about Eddington's flight and summons Torrey and company, who arrive just as the radio operator makes contact. Eddington reports his position southwest of Cape Titan, but stops short as he sees a large task force heading south away from the cape. Ignoring a group of nearby Zero fighters, he drops out of the clouds for a closer look, counting twelve destroyers, four cruisers, and one gigantic battleship which he soon identifies as the Yamato - the largest and most heavily armed warship in the world. The Zeroes pounce on him again, and he has no time for evasive maneuvers before he and the bomber are destroyed. With the death of his best friend now compounding his concerns, Torrey dampens all optimism by concluding that the task force is headed straight for Levu-Vana to reinforce the land garrison. He decides to proceed with the invasion and then put back to sea with his own task group to try and stop the Japanese force at all costs. McConnel asks about a recommendation for a posthumous award to Eddington, but Torrey declines it, knowing that Eddington was trying to atone for his part in Annalee's death.Following the invasion, Torrey's cruisers and destroyers head for open sea to search and engage. They are unable at first to locate the enemy until they determine that the enemy is running through the narrow passage between Levu-Vana and neighboring Toko-Rota. Torrey orders the passage mined and the PT boats put in position. While waiting for a first report, he has a quiet conversation with Powell about battles at sea and the fear experienced by all men who take part in them - even admirals. All too soon, the Japanese reach the mine field, where several escorts are hit and disabled, prompting the PT boats to go in with guns blazing. The Japanese fight tooth and nail, and Jere, whose skipper is hit and killed by shrapnel, takes over command of his boat and manages to hit a heavy cruiser with two torpedoes before his boat is rammed and sunk by an enemy destroyer. The Yamato emerges from this stage of the battle unscathed.In the morning, amidst an unnervingly silent lull, Torrey receives the casualty report and is visibly devastated by the news of Jere's death in action. He is quiet but intent as he orders the destroyers to lay a smoke screen and prepare for the final engagement. The destroyers lay the screen as the cruisers turn broadside, lock and load, taking the first shots against the Japanese force. Many of the enemy escorts are hit hard; even the Yamato is lightly damaged, but presses on through the attack. Torrey orders evasive maneuvers as the Yamato opens fire.

    Synopsis
    The story opens on the night of December 6, 1941, at a dance in the Officers' Club at Pearl Harbor. We are at first introduced to Lieutenant (j.g.) William 'Mac' McConnel (Tom Tryon) and his wife Beverly (Paula Prentiss), who can't help but notice a visibly inebriated Liz Eddington (Barbara Bouchet) dancing with an Army Air Corps major (Hugh O'Brian) - spiting her husband who is at sea on gunnery practice. When the band launches into an upbeat swing tune, Liz engages in an exotic dance that for better or for worse draws the attention of every person in the club. Mac finally asks the band to make an end and play something else, which is heeded to Liz's disappointment. Her lover escorts her from the premises and takes her to spend the rest of the night on a beach near the base.Morning breaks over the unnamed heavy cruiser commanded by Captain Rockwell 'Rock' Torrey (John Wayne), who is nonplussed to find that his executive officer, Liz's husband Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas), has overslept reveille, the latest of a number of blemishes on his record that (along with his mounting alcoholism) can be laid to his unhappy marriage. He tells Eddington to 'fish or cut bait' and gives him one last chance to pull himself together. Eddington apologizes for his conduct, but is left wondering what Liz has gotten herself into in recent hours.In Pearl Harbor, Mac reports for duty as Officer of the Day on his destroyer, the U.S.S. Cassiday. With some consternation, he reads a radio dispatch from the destroyer U.S.S. Ward, which has depth-charged an unidentified submarine contact much too close to Pearl for comfort. Torrey's ship has received the same message; he orders alert status, then general quarters when one of his lookouts sights several large formations of planes flying over Oahu. The Japanese surprise attack is only minutes away. One formation flies over and strafes the beach where Liz Eddington and her lover are awakening, and they make a hasty escape back towards Pearl. As they hurtle around a curve, a truck barrels toward them in the wrong lane from the opposite direction, and the head-on collision sends them both plunging in flames off a cliff to their deaths.As nearly 350 Japanese aircraft descend on Pearl Harbor, an emergency sortie signal is sent to all ships; Mac, without waiting for his C.O. or further instructions, orders the Cassiday with cool-headed authority to get underway at once. The captain and executive officer give chase aboard a torpedo retriever, but Mac, knowing any attempt to stop and bring them aboard will render the Cassiday a sitting duck, ignores their shouts and plows out of the harbor at high speed. The Cassiday is one of not a dozen cruisers and destroyers to escape the harbor as the battleships and aircraft are decimated by the Japanese planes, much to the dismay of Admiral Kimmel (Franchot Tone), once he receives a situation report from his flag lieutenant.Torrey, meanwhile, gives orders for all outbreaking ships to group with his cruiser and reports his force strength to headquarters. It is a woefully small squadron of four cruisers and eight destroyers, a sneeze at a typhoon. Vice Admiral B.T. Broderick (Dana Andrews) urges Kimmel to position the force against a possible invasion, but Kimmel decides instead to have Torrey seek out and engage the Japanese. The orders are met with surprise and some anticipation by Torrey and his officers, who request underway refueling the following day. The morning of December 8 brings them nothing but an empty fleet oiler heading for home, leaving the task group without enough fuel to last half the day. Weighing his options, Torrey decides to cease zigzagging despite the known submarine threat.Not long thereafter, the American force is stalked by a Japanese submarine which is detected by the Cassiday as it approaches. Mac orders pursuit and depth-charging while Torrey orders zigzagging resumed. But the submarine gets into firing position and puts two torpedoes into the cruiser, causing severe damage in the engineering section and breaking Torrey's arm when he is thrown off his feet. Eddington goes below to take charge of damage control and finds the engineering deck a shambles of fire and out-of-control flooding. As DC parties scramble to save the ship, the Cassiday continues depth-charging, reporting a positive kill. Torrey orders all ships except the Cassiday back to Pearl Harbor, and conferring with Mac by megaphone, remembers him well from his days at the Naval Academy. Eddington reports the main damage under control as Mac complies with Torrey's request for a tow.A few days later, Torrey, his arm set and casted, reports to Admiral Kimmel's office where he is relieved of command for jeopardizing his force. He is reassigned to a desk to route convoys over his contention that the admiral's orders rendered the group 'expendable'. In the meantime, Eddington has learned of Liz's death and identifies her and her belongings at the Honolulu morgue, also learning of her companion's attachment to the Army Air Corps. In a rut of shock, he goes to a bar where he is offered a drink by another AAC officer who unwittingly rubs salt in the wound. The resulting brawl lands Eddington in the brig, where Torrey later arrives to have him released. They part ways in the sight of a new cruiser going to sea to replace their drydocked vessel - a baleful metaphor for the drydocking they both face.Three months later, Torrey's arm is pronounced healed by the X-rays of a nurse lieutenant named Maggie Haynes (Patricia Neal). His roommate, Commander Egan Powell (Burgess Meredith), a reserve intelligence officer, offers to celebrate at a social gathering in the Oahu hills. There, Torrey has a chance encounter with Maggie, who startles him with news of his estranged son - Jeremiah Torrey (Brandon De Wilde), now a reserve ensign who has been dating Maggie's roommate, Annalee Dorne (Jill Haworth). Torrey confesses that he has been divorced and not seen Jere in eighteen years. By the time Maggie drives him home and advises him that she's on temporary assignment, they have taken an obvious liking to each other. Torrey discovers that Jere is attached to a PT boat squadron in Pearl and goes to visit him, where they have a strained reunion; Jere lets it slip that he is about to be reassigned to Admiral Broderick's staff in preparation for an upcoming offensive called 'Skyhook'. Jere will be assistant to former Congressman Neal Owynn (Patrick O'Neal), serving in the Naval Reserve as Broderick's public-affairs officer.After a couple of weeks, a cheerful Powell arrives at Torrey's office, quietly letting on that he has been in Washington for the past ten days. Torrey takes him to lunch, and seeing Jere and Owynn sitting at a nearby table, takes the opportunity to ask Powell about Skyhook. Powell immediately puts a top-secret lid on it but is not surprised to discover that Owynn has been doing too much talking on Broderick's behalf. That evening, Torrey and Jere run into each other at Maggie and Annalee's apartment; there Maggie and Torrey remain while Jere and Annalee go to dinner at Owynn's house. As the evening wears on, Maggie and Torrey open up about each other's past of failed marriages and occupations chosen or unchosen. In the meantime, Owynn, obliging Jere's wishes, slips silently away to allow Jere a subtle run to second base. Annalee, wary of Owynn's disappearance and Jere's advances, puts the date - and their relationship - to an abrupt end.Torrey returns to his office after several days to find Powell waiting with a 'private little job': the routing of three hot and heavy convoys to a former Free French naval base on the island of Toulebonne in the South Pacific. Torrey figures out the Skyhook strategy, and explains to Powell that Broderick could use one of three nearby islands as a staging base to hit at a large island named Levu-Vana, whose central plain would make an ideal roost for B-17 squadrons. Powell wordlessly covers up the charts and leaves. Torrey arrives home that night to find Maggie sitting on his front steps; he invites her inside, where she regretfully tells him that her unit is being shipped out. Torrey, knowing where she's headed, calls on Powell to bunk out for the night, whereupon Maggie slips her shoes off in a classic 'fade to black' scene.Three weeks find the convoys safe and sound at Toulebonne, where Paul Eddington has been stationed since January overseeing piers and warehouses. Pursuant to a written request from Torrey, he boards the nurses' transport and asks to speak to Maggie, and welcomes her and several other nurses with flower chains, a basket of bananas and a hidden bottle of liquor. Maggie introduces him to Annalee and he immediately takes a shine to her. He gives Maggie the unexpected news that the convoy is due to shove off again that night for Broderick's advance base on Gavabutu, as 'that's where they're gonna need nurses'.Back in Hawaii, Torrey visits Beverly McConnel at her civil air defense post to give her the unpleasant news that Mac is MIA. She tearfully reads him a letter from Mac, written with his morale at a critical low, describing incessant air attacks on the Cassiday and the overall poor quality of Broderick's command, which has stalled the Skyhook advance and riddled the morale of the troops. Not long afterward, Torrey is summoned to a dinner party at Admiral Nimitz's quarters - and is shocked but pleased to find that the party is in honor of his promotion to rear admiral. Admiral Nimitz (Henry Fonda) tells him that he was correct in his guess at the Skyhook strategy, and awards tactical command of the operation to Torrey, effectively displacing Broderick from the action (or lack thereof). Broderick is incensed, and agrees with Owynn's suggestion to place a 'liaison officer' on Torrey's staff to keep him discreetly informed on Torrey's intentions, naming Owynn as that officer. Eddington arrives at Broderick's headquarters (having spent the past few hours at a whorehouse), and himself receives a surprise promotion to captain and an appointment as Torrey's chief of staff.Torrey and Eddington reunite on Gavabutu three days later and meet the rest of the staff, along with Australian coastwatcher Clayton Canfil (Stanley Holloway) and a ready and willing battalion of Marine paratroops. Their base almost immediately comes under a Japanese air raid and they make a mad dash for the command shelter, where Torrey outlines his plan to divide and conquer Gavabutu in three sections. At the all-clear, the staff scatter to their duties, and Eddington surreptitiously dismisses Owynn and Jere to prevent them from listening in on a scheme to procure additional transport planes. Torrey goes to the base hospital to visit Maggie, promising her that they'll make time for each other out here.The following Sunday, the Marines parachute into an open meadow on the north side of the island as an amphibious force lands on a northwestern beach, and a battalion of Marines, led by Canfil, crosses the mountains on foot. Torrey accompanies the paramarines aloft, ordering his plane's commander on a 'sightseeing trip' to overfly the mountains and deliver a change of orders to the foot battalion. Back at his HQ, Broderick, having arrived in the company of a group of war correspondents from Toulebonne, demonstrates a too-concise knowledge of the details, leading Eddington to suspect that Owynn has been quietly feeding him information. When Torrey returns, he is informed by his operations officer that the operation is well ahead of schedule - the Japanese garrison abandoned Gavabutu the previous night, presumably to reinforce Levu-Vana. He reports as much to Broderick and the correspondents, who are frustrated with the limited information Torrey gives them. Jere, earlier confronted by Eddington about his role in ratting on his father, renounces it in his newfound respect for him. Eddington later confronts Owynn as well, coercing him through harsh physical contact into returning to Toulebonne with Broderick. Owynn threatens a court-martial, but Jere, the only witness, refuses to bear him out, choosing instead to be transferred back to PT boats and remain under his father's command.Canfil returns to HQ from his guidance of the Marine battalion, and is promptly asked by Torrey and Eddington to reconnoiter the Japanese positions on Levu-Vana. He volunteers to go ashore alone with his intimate knowledge of the island and map the enemy emplacements. He is put ashore by a submarine under cover of darkness, sneaking into a Japanese camp and eavesdropping on a sake party.The next morning, Jere, back on duty with the PT squadron, is delivering mail to the hospital when he meets Maggie and Annalee; the latter shows him to the mail room, and old flames between them are rekindled, leading to an engagement to marriage after the war. Elsewhere in the world, other flames are fanned - Mac McConnel and the survivors of the Cassiday have been rescued and returned to the States for a month of survivors' leave. Beverly meets him in a passionate reunion at the pier in San Francisco, where he announces his promotion to lieutenant commander and his post-leave assignment as Torrey's flag secretary.Back on Gavabutu, Annalee, who is accompanying Eddington and a group of other personnel to a beach party, is warned by Maggie to be cautious around him, but insists on having a little fun. Maggie's warning is well warranted, for when Annalee separates from the group to go for a swim, Eddington follows her and watches from the beach. When she emerges from the water and tells him she's engaged, his reaction is less than rational - he flings her clothes out of her reach and rapes her, out of sight of the others. In her desperate attempt to fight back, she leaves her mark on his face, and it is noticed by Powell a couple of days later when Torrey and his staff put out to the harbor to meet his old ship, which along with several other cruisers and destroyers has just anchored at Gavabutu. Eddington dismisses the mark as 'just a friendly wound.'Aboard their old cruiser, Torrey and Eddington brief the senior officers of the task group on the planned invasion of Levu-Vana when they are interrupted by Canfil, just returned from his recon mission. He has painted a grim picture of the stronghold under construction, from tanks and troops to pillboxes and a nearly-completed airfield. Then he delivers the grimmest report of all - the Japanese are assembling a task force of their own at their nearby Cape Titan base. Torrey discusses options with his staff, deciding eventually that their best choice is to try and get a long-range recon plane from Pearl Harbor.In San Francisco, Mac McConnel returns from fleet HQ with ill tidings for him and Beverly: he has orders to proceed immediately to his new assignment on Gavabutu, despite having spent less than half of his leave. Beverly bursts into tears, lamenting that she may not get him back this time, and asks him to leave her with a baby.The rains are hammering Gavabutu and vicinity when Maggie returns to her barracks to find a note addressed to her. It is from Annalee - who has overdosed on sleeping pills, fearing pregnancy from the rape and being disbelieved by Eddington. Maggie desperately attempts to rouse Annalee, but finding that it's too late, she calls Torrey, who is discussing with Eddington and Powell the failure to secure a recon plane from Pearl. At Eddington's query, Torrey somberly tells him what has happened, leaving Eddington guilt-stricken as he heads for the nurse barracks. Maggie, boiling with anger, tells him the gist of the note, and Torrey promises to tell Jere personally before telling Maggie that Skyhook is starting very soon. She flings a farewell embrace on him and rushes away, as Torrey returns to HQ with his personal matters now weighing almost as much on his mind as his command responsibilities.First thing the next morning, Eddington dashes to the airfield and orders a long-range naval bomber prepared for him; he lifts off without telling a soul. Meanwhile, Torrey heads over to the PT boat base on the other side of the island, where he tells a grief-stricken Jere about Annalee and bids him farewell. He then repairs to HQ, where Mac has just arrived from Toulebonne, and sends Powell in search of Eddington before taking in a weather forecast. At the airfield, Powell finds out about Eddington's flight and summons Torrey and company, who arrive just as the radio operator makes contact. Eddington reports his position southwest of Cape Titan, but stops short as he sees a large task force heading south away from the cape. Ignoring a group of nearby Zero fighters, he drops out of the clouds for a closer look, counting twelve destroyers, four cruisers, and one gigantic battleship which he soon identifies as the Yamato - the largest and most heavily armed warship in the world. The Zeroes pounce on him again, and he has no time for evasive maneuvers before he and the bomber are destroyed. With the death of his best friend now compounding his concerns, Torrey dampens all optimism by concluding that the task force is headed straight for Levu-Vana to reinforce the land garrison. He decides to proceed with the invasion and then put back to sea with his own task group to try and stop the Japanese force at all costs. McConnel asks about a recommendation for a posthumous award to Eddington, but Torrey declines it, knowing that Eddington was trying to atone for his part in Annalee's death.Following the invasion, Torrey's cruisers and destroyers head for open sea to search and engage. They are unable at first to locate the enemy until they determine that the enemy is running through the narrow passage between Levu-Vana and neighboring Toko-Rota. Torrey orders the passage mined and the PT boats put in position. While waiting for a first report, he has a quiet conversation with Powell about battles at sea and the fear experienced by all men who take part in them - even admirals. All too soon, the Japanese reach the mine field, where several escorts are hit and disabled, prompting the PT boats to go in with guns blazing. The Japanese fight tooth and nail, and Jere, whose skipper is hit and killed by shrapnel, takes over command of his boat and manages to hit a heavy cruiser with two torpedoes before his boat is rammed and sunk by an enemy destroyer. The Yamato emerges from this stage of the battle unscathed.In the morning, amidst an unnervingly silent lull, Torrey receives the casualty report and is visibly devastated by the news of Jere's death in action. He is quiet but intent as he orders the destroyers to lay a smoke screen and prepare for the final engagement. The destroyers lay the screen as the cruisers turn broadside, lock and load, taking the first shots against the Japanese force. Many of the enemy escorts are hit hard; even the Yamato is lightly damaged, but presses on through the attack. Torrey orders evasive maneuvers as the Yamato opens fire. In spite of a number of hard course changes and pitched counterfire, the Americans are hopelessly outgunned, and the Yamato ultimately wrecks seven of their ships - Torrey's included. With the captain and bridge officers of his flagship killed, he attempts to take command but is hit and severely wounded by shell fragments from a magazine explosion. Mac, however, has stuck with him and gives the order to abandon ship, getting him into the water and onto a life raft.Torrey is in a coma for almost three weeks before he awakes aboard a hospital ship a day away from Pearl Harbor. His attending nurse summons Maggie, who rushes to his room to help him come around. She tells him all that transpired after he was knocked out - that he has lost his left leg and Mac is the only survivor of his staff.

"22","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059043/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","While collecting butterflies out in the English countryside, a young man named Freddie Clegg (Terence Stamp) stumbles across an old secluded house for sale. Looking through the house on his own, he seems most interested in the basement. He decides to buy the house, its purchase the catalyst for actually carrying out the plan he has devised for her. He wasn't sure if he could carry it out before coming across the house.The ""her"" in question is a young woman named Miranda Grey (Samantha Eggar), she a student at the Blake School of Art in London. Freddie knows her whereabouts at all times. On the day he decides to carry out his plan, he follows her from school to a pub where she meets with a young man. After that meeting which she seems sad about, she wanders around a secluded urban park. His van is parked so that she would have to get right next to it to pass. As she does, he jumps out of the van, grabs her, knocks her out with chloroform, and gets her into the back of the van. He drives her to his newly purchased house, and carries her still unconscious into the basement. He lays her down onto a bed, and walks out of the basement, bolting the door behind him. The basement door is behind a hidden door masked as a bookcase to the main part of the house. He goes into the kitchen to splash water on his face, when it starts to rain outside. Transfixed, he goes outside to lie in the rain. There, he reminisces about one of many painful encounters he had at the bank where he worked in Reading. He is being tormented by his colleagues, who call him the butterfly boy. His Aunt Annie (Mona Washbourne) visits him at the bank, something she is not supposed to do, telling him that he has won £71,000 in the football pools.Miranda eventually awakens, frightened not knowing where she is. She yells for help while pounding at the door, to no avail. She goes to the sink to splash water on her face. She notices that the makeshift bathroom area (there is no tub or shower) is designed for a woman, with many new women's toiletries available for use. She also finds a shelf filled with art books, and a dresser and closet filled with women's clothes her size. She hears noise at the door. Freddie knocks before he enters. He has brought her a tray of food and returns her purse minus any dangerous items, such as the file and scissors. Not knowing who he is, she suspects that he has kidnapped her for ransom despite she not coming from a rich family. He demonstrates to her that he knows all about her (including that she is not rich) and is attentive to her wants and needs. He leaves, bolting the door behind him. She clamors at the door shouting for him to come back.The next day, Freddie drives into London. He sees news in the papers that she is missing.Back at the house, Freddie brings Miranda more food. She has a more defiant attitude and demands to know who he is and why he brought her here. She now suspects he's a sexual predator. He tells her that he has every respect for her and is a guest at his house. As she runs to try and escape, he grabs her from behind. This act of touching her makes him confess that he is in love with her, something he was not going to tell her until she got to know him better. She is shocked by this revelation. He tells her that he had originally seen her on a bus in Reading where she is from, he even sitting next to her on a couple of occasions. When she got the scholarship to attend Blake in London, he thought he would forget about her, but her absence made him realize she was the only one for him. She then tries to reason with him, stating that he could get into trouble, that she worked hard for the scholarship and that her family must be worried sick. He knows in his heart that the reason she wants to leave is because she is in love with the chap she met at the pub the day of the kidnapping. His ultimate rebuttal is that although people may be looking for her, no one is looking for him. She tries to reason with him one more time, stating that she won't tell anyone, that she'll become his friend and admire him for his chivalry. As he still won't let her go, she runs out the open door to find the next door still locked, with no one behind it to hear her yells for help. Knowing that she is still trapped, her behavior turns to anger. She tells him if her release is dependent upon her falling in love with him, she'll be there until she dies. He walks out quietly carrying the tray of food.As he comes down the next day to bring her more food, he can hear her moaning in pain behind the door. Entering, he finds her on the bed writhing in agony. She says it feels like an appendix problem and that she needs a doctor. Concerned both for her and for his own safety, he vows to go to the corner of the road to the phone box. As he rushes out, he leaves all the doors open. After no longer hearing his footsteps, she, only feigning the illness, quietly gets up and tiptoes to the first door. She sees the second door open to outside. As she approaches, the door shuts closed. Freddie knows she was lying to him. As he approaches her, she slaps him across the face. He has a sad look. She dejectedly walks back into the basement, and slams the door behind her. Coming into the basement, he offers her a bargain: he will let her go in six weeks no questions asked if she starts eating, if she talks to him and if she is nice to him. They negotiate the time frame ultimately to four weeks, the release date specified as June 11th. Despite telling him that he will never get what he ultimately wants which is for her to fall in love with him, she agrees, with conditions of her own: she wants some fresh air, some natural light, specific food (fruit and salad), art materials and most importantly the ability to write a letter to her family. He agrees to her conditions. As she finally starts to devour the food he's brought for her, he leaves, with a new bounce in his step buoyed by her agreeing to stay.About a week later, there is a calendar that Miranda has painted on the brick wall with the art supplies he has provided her. She is crossing off the days to ""freedom"" day. She asks Freddie, who is sitting there with her, to do something to keep her amused: dance or tell a story. She says all men know dirty stories. He is reluctant. As she is about to tell the filthiest story she knows, he stops her and tells a silly joke, to which she giggles. He then offers her a treat: a bath in the main part of the house. She's excited, even if he is going to tie her hands behind her. Because of her protests, he decides not to gag her. As they walk outside into dusk, she deeply breathes in the fresh air. She pleads to take a short walk before the bath. He agrees. As they take a few steps, he turns around and starts to caress her arms and face. She increasingly looks panicked and eventually starts to scream. She stops when he places his hand on her mouth. Knowing that he has crossed a line, they walk quietly into the house. She tells him that if he decides ever to cross that line with her again, not to do it in a mean way and she won't struggle. But if it does happen, she'll never forgive him and she'll never speak to him again. He understands and agrees.As they enter the bathroom, he unties her hands, leaves the room and closes the door behind him. She notices the door is unlockable, peeks out and sees him sitting in a chair in the hallway. Seeing her, he tells her he will respect her privacy. She goes back into the bathroom, and turns on the water as a noise distraction as she surveys the room. The windows are boarded and bolted and he has removed anything that she can use as a weapon. On the other side of the door, he questions her about the man in the pub, seeing them as an unlikely match. She offers little information beyond stating that he is only a friend. She starts taking her bath when the doorbell rings. Sensing an opportunity, she starts to scream. Freddie quickly rushes into the bathroom and overpowers her, gags her, pulls her out of the tub and manages to tie her up to a pipe. Thinking that she's secure, Freddie espies the visitor from an upstairs window. When he sees the visitor snooping around the basement door, he feels he has no option but to acknowledge his existence. He is his neighbor from down the lane, Colonel Whitcomb (Maurice Dallimore), who thought he would finally introduce himself. The Colonel has noticed some of the modifications he's made to the house, such as the lights in the basement, to which the ancient monuments people of the area would object. As the Colonel enters the house, Miranda can hear he's there and his reference to her captor as ""Franklin"". She can just reach the bathtub faucet with her foot and tries to turn it on to create some noise. Just as the Colonel is about to leave, Miranda is able to turn on the faucet. As the Colonel hears the noise, Freddie announces that he has a male cousin staying with him. As the Colonel gets distracted by other items in the house, the water starts to overflow from the bathtub. As the Colonel is about ready to leave for the second time, water starts flowing down the stairs which both Freddie and the Colonel notice. Freddie runs up the stairs announcing that it is really his girlfriend staying there. He manages to go into the bathroom to have a discussion with his ""girlfriend"" about the water problem, while in the meantime turning off the faucet, unplugging the drain and tying Miranda up tighter. Freddie comes back out and announces to the satisfied Colonel that the problem was a faucet handle that came off and that his girlfriend didn't call out because of the embarrassment of being caught unmarried in a compromising position in a man's house. After the Colonel leaves, Freddie unties Miranda. Both are silent, but Freddie brings the towel further up to cover her otherwise unclad body, then leaves her to let her dress in peace.As Miranda exits the bathroom, Freddie is waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs. She requests that he tie her hands in front rather than behind since it hurts less. He obliges. Before heading back to the basement, Freddie shows her his massive butterfly collection, which includes some exotic specimens he raised from larvae sent to him from other parts of the world, some breeds which he developed himself, and some still live specimens. This has been his hobby since childhood. Despite seeing the beauty of the collection, she uses the words ""kill"" and ""death"" to describe what he's doing. She also then realizes that she is his latest collectable. This collecting is not based on love, but rather an infatuation reminiscent of schoolboys. When he mentions in passing his time working at the bank in Reading, she remembers him in the news about winning the pools. She tries to persuade him to do something more meaningful with his life with those moneys.Days later, Miranda is doing a pencil self-portrait as she looks in the mirror. Freddie asks her if she would consider selling it. She makes the asking price £200. He agrees. She doesn't understand why anyone would want it as she thinks it's garbage. She tears it out of her sketch pad, hands it to him and tells him to keep it with his butterflies. She seems out of sorts, he believes because she has not yet written her letter to her family. Handing her some nondescript stationery, he starts to dictate what she can write in that letter: that she is safe and well looked after. As she is addressing the envelope she tries to distract him by offering him another one of her sketches on the wall for free. As he turns to choose one, she slips another note in the envelope along with the dictated letter. He hands her the chosen sketch which he asks her to sign. She sarcastically signs it ""prisoner #..."" As he seals the envelope, he feels around its edges and can feel something extra inside. He opens it to see the second note. It basically tells that her captor's name is Gerald Franklin, he being the winner of the football pools. But what he is offended by is the statement that she is frightened. They begin to argue, he accusing that she still looks down on him and so would her friends and her type. As she tries to convince him otherwise, he asks if he could talk to her friends about the book she requested him to buy for her, ""The Catcher in the Rye"". She says yes. As such, he takes the book off the bed and announces that he will read it. As he exits, he tears up the letter in front of her stating that it would have done no good since they are not in Reading and his real name is not Franklin.On ""freedom"" day, Miranda is wearing her own clothes as Freddie brings her a tray of food. She is putting things in order in the basement and offers him all the pictures on the walls. She puts on her coat ready to leave. When she reminds him of the day and their agreement, he tells her that she will be released at midnight. As she sits down dejected, they begin to talk about ""The Catcher in the Rye"". When he mentions that he found it unrealistic, she quietly tells him that that is a valid point of view. That statement and others later concerning a Picasso painting show him that she is being patronizing and condescending. He realizes that they can never be friends on the outside. Feeling like she's jeopardized her freedom, she clamors at the door as he leaves. On either side of the door, both Freddie and Miranda are in tormented and in tears. Freddie heads upstairs to his own bedroom to retrieve a box. He brings it back down for Miranda, telling her it is for this evening. He leaves her alone to let her open the box in peace.Later that evening, Freddie comes down to see that Miranda is wearing the evening dress that he bought for her. They will be having supper upstairs tonight, and he isn't even tying her hands for the walk up. She is pleased. She walks upstairs with enthusiasm to see a candlelit table complete with champagne and caviar. As they talk about life in the immediate future, she notices he has had her sketch framed. As they sit down to eat, she finds a ring box in her napkin. He asks her to marry him, the marriage to be in name only. She would live at the house but be free to do whatever she pleases, even sleep in another bedroom. She replies that that is not marriage; marriage is belonging wholeheartedly to another person. But she does agree to marry him. With a sinister look in his eyes, he states that to get married, they would require witnesses, implying that he is not letting her have her freedom. As she understands that implication, she runs toward any door trying to get out. She eventually runs into the butterfly collection room. He corners her with chloroform in his hands. As she grabs for an insect pin and tries to stab him, he overpowers her and renders her unconscious with the chloroform. He carries her unconscious body out of the room and stops. Instead of taking her to the basement, he instead brings her upstairs into his bedroom. He lays her down on the bed and lies next to her. He gently caresses her body and face before eventually embracing her.When she awakens the next day, she is back in the basement with Freddie seated in a chair next to the bed. He apologizes for the force, but he defends its use since she provoked it. He also claims that he did not take advantage of her in her unconscious state. He says that he has to keep her a little while longer since she has not *tried* to do want he ultimately wants, which is for her to fall in love with him.Later, Miranda is coming out of the upstairs bathroom. She puts out her hands ready for them to be tied, which Freddie does do. She asks if they can sit in the living room instead of heading to the basement. They have a drink of sherry while doing so. She wants them to be friends again. She sits on his lap, places her tied arms around him and asks him to do the same. They kiss on her request. When she asks him to untie her hands, he obliges despite accusing her of pretending. She slowly undresses and she kisses him. As she encourages him to kiss her back, he does so passionately for a few seconds, then stops abruptly. He yells at her that she thinks he will have to let her go if they make love. Comparing her to a whore, he no longer respects her and tears up the drawing of hers he had framed and throws it into the fireplace. After she dresses, he reties her hands together. She then realizes that she is never getting out alive. She directly asks him that question. He does not answer. He opens the door as they walk through the pouring rain toward the basement door. As they approach the door, she sees a shovel. She distracts him by dropping her toiletries on the ground. As he picks them up, she grabs the shovel and hits him over the head. Horrified by his bloodied face the result of what she's done, she instead decides to run. He quickly catches her. While clutching his bloodied head, he drags her yelling and screaming toward the basement door. He throws her on the ground, cold and wet. She looks at him and again is horrified by his bloodied head. As he leaves and locks the door behind him, she knocks over the electric heater. Her hands still tied, she is left in tears, feeling she is soon going to die.Injured, Freddie manages to drive himself to a hospital, where doctors and nurses attend to him.In the basement, Miranda tries to cut the bindings loose from her hands. She is unable to do so. She grabs a blanket off the bed and wraps herself in it. She starts to cough.Three days later, Freddie drives himself home. Bringing a tray of food to the basement, he finds Miranda cold and shivering under the blankets. Although he cuts the bindings off her hands, he can barely look at her after what she did to him. Begging for him not to leave, she collapses on the floor. He goes over to her and carries her onto the bed. Barely conscious, she says that she is afraid to die. He professes his love for her. Seeing that she really is ill, he rushes off for a doctor, all the while leaving both doors open. From her bed, she can see the sunlight, meaning that the exterior door is open. She struggles to get out of bed.Freddie is in town and stops short of the doctor's office.He returns to the basement with pills in hand, the announcement that the doctor will soon be there, and that she will be better soon. But Miranda hears nothing as she is already dead. Freddie clutches his face in a short moment of grief. He goes over to the other side of the room, sits and watches her for the rest of the afternoon, reminiscing about every moment he has spent with her and absorbing the fact that death is forever.He buries her in a homemade coffin under an oak tree on his property.He contemplates the actions leading to her death and the role he may have played in her feeling like she needed to beat him with the shovel. But he comes to the conclusion that Miranda got everything she deserved. His mistake was aiming too high in choosing a girl outside of his social class. He should have chosen a girl who he could teach. As he thinks these thoughts, he drives down the street toward the nurse (Edina Roday) he met in the hospital.","

    Synopsis
    While collecting butterflies out in the English countryside, a young man named Freddie Clegg (Terence Stamp) stumbles across an old secluded house for sale. Looking through the house on his own, he seems most interested in the basement. He decides to buy the house, its purchase the catalyst for actually carrying out the plan he has devised for her. He wasn't sure if he could carry it out before coming across the house.The ""her"" in question is a young woman named Miranda Grey (Samantha Eggar), she a student at the Blake School of Art in London. Freddie knows her whereabouts at all times. On the day he decides to carry out his plan, he follows her from school to a pub where she meets with a young man. After that meeting which she seems sad about, she wanders around a secluded urban park. His van is parked so that she would have to get right next to it to pass. As she does, he jumps out of the van, grabs her, knocks her out with chloroform, and gets her into the back of the van. He drives her to his newly purchased house, and carries her still unconscious into the basement. He lays her down onto a bed, and walks out of the basement, bolting the door behind him. The basement door is behind a hidden door masked as a bookcase to the main part of the house. He goes into the kitchen to splash water on his face, when it starts to rain outside. Transfixed, he goes outside to lie in the rain. There, he reminisces about one of many painful encounters he had at the bank where he worked in Reading. He is being tormented by his colleagues, who call him the butterfly boy. His Aunt Annie (Mona Washbourne) visits him at the bank, something she is not supposed to do, telling him that he has won £71,000 in the football pools.Miranda eventually awakens, frightened not knowing where she is. She yells for help while pounding at the door, to no avail. She goes to the sink to splash water on her face. She notices that the makeshift bathroom area (there is no tub or shower) is designed for a woman, with many new women's toiletries available for use. She also finds a shelf filled with art books, and a dresser and closet filled with women's clothes her size. She hears noise at the door. Freddie knocks before he enters. He has brought her a tray of food and returns her purse minus any dangerous items, such as the file and scissors. Not knowing who he is, she suspects that he has kidnapped her for ransom despite she not coming from a rich family. He demonstrates to her that he knows all about her (including that she is not rich) and is attentive to her wants and needs. He leaves, bolting the door behind him. She clamors at the door shouting for him to come back.The next day, Freddie drives into London. He sees news in the papers that she is missing.Back at the house, Freddie brings Miranda more food. She has a more defiant attitude and demands to know who he is and why he brought her here. She now suspects he's a sexual predator. He tells her that he has every respect for her and is a guest at his house. As she runs to try and escape, he grabs her from behind. This act of touching her makes him confess that he is in love with her, something he was not going to tell her until she got to know him better. She is shocked by this revelation. He tells her that he had originally seen her on a bus in Reading where she is from, he even sitting next to her on a couple of occasions. When she got the scholarship to attend Blake in London, he thought he would forget about her, but her absence made him realize she was the only one for him. She then tries to reason with him, stating that he could get into trouble, that she worked hard for the scholarship and that her family must be worried sick. He knows in his heart that the reason she wants to leave is because she is in love with the chap she met at the pub the day of the kidnapping. His ultimate rebuttal is that although people may be looking for her, no one is looking for him. She tries to reason with him one more time, stating that she won't tell anyone, that she'll become his friend and admire him for his chivalry. As he still won't let her go, she runs out the open door to find the next door still locked, with no one behind it to hear her yells for help. Knowing that she is still trapped, her behavior turns to anger. She tells him if her release is dependent upon her falling in love with him, she'll be there until she dies. He walks out quietly carrying the tray of food.As he comes down the next day to bring her more food, he can hear her moaning in pain behind the door. Entering, he finds her on the bed writhing in agony. She says it feels like an appendix problem and that she needs a doctor. Concerned both for her and for his own safety, he vows to go to the corner of the road to the phone box. As he rushes out, he leaves all the doors open. After no longer hearing his footsteps, she, only feigning the illness, quietly gets up and tiptoes to the first door. She sees the second door open to outside. As she approaches, the door shuts closed. Freddie knows she was lying to him. As he approaches her, she slaps him across the face. He has a sad look. She dejectedly walks back into the basement, and slams the door behind her. Coming into the basement, he offers her a bargain: he will let her go in six weeks no questions asked if she starts eating, if she talks to him and if she is nice to him. They negotiate the time frame ultimately to four weeks, the release date specified as June 11th. Despite telling him that he will never get what he ultimately wants which is for her to fall in love with him, she agrees, with conditions of her own: she wants some fresh air, some natural light, specific food (fruit and salad), art materials and most importantly the ability to write a letter to her family. He agrees to her conditions. As she finally starts to devour the food he's brought for her, he leaves, with a new bounce in his step buoyed by her agreeing to stay.About a week later, there is a calendar that Miranda has painted on the brick wall with the art supplies he has provided her. She is crossing off the days to ""freedom"" day. She asks Freddie, who is sitting there with her, to do something to keep her amused: dance or tell a story. She says all men know dirty stories. He is reluctant. As she is about to tell the filthiest story she knows, he stops her and tells a silly joke, to which she giggles. He then offers her a treat: a bath in the main part of the house. She's excited, even if he is going to tie her hands behind her. Because of her protests, he decides not to gag her. As they walk outside into dusk, she deeply breathes in the fresh air. She pleads to take a short walk before the bath. He agrees. As they take a few steps, he turns around and starts to caress her arms and face. She increasingly looks panicked and eventually starts to scream. She stops when he places his hand on her mouth. Knowing that he has crossed a line, they walk quietly into the house. She tells him that if he decides ever to cross that line with her again, not to do it in a mean way and she won't struggle. But if it does happen, she'll never forgive him and she'll never speak to him again. He understands and agrees.As they enter the bathroom, he unties her hands, leaves the room and closes the door behind him. She notices the door is unlockable, peeks out and sees him sitting in a chair in the hallway. Seeing her, he tells her he will respect her privacy. She goes back into the bathroom, and turns on the water as a noise distraction as she surveys the room. The windows are boarded and bolted and he has removed anything that she can use as a weapon. On the other side of the door, he questions her about the man in the pub, seeing them as an unlikely match. She offers little information beyond stating that he is only a friend. She starts taking her bath when the doorbell rings. Sensing an opportunity, she starts to scream. Freddie quickly rushes into the bathroom and overpowers her, gags her, pulls her out of the tub and manages to tie her up to a pipe. Thinking that she's secure, Freddie espies the visitor from an upstairs window. When he sees the visitor snooping around the basement door, he feels he has no option but to acknowledge his existence. He is his neighbor from down the lane, Colonel Whitcomb (Maurice Dallimore), who thought he would finally introduce himself. The Colonel has noticed some of the modifications he's made to the house, such as the lights in the basement, to which the ancient monuments people of the area would object. As the Colonel enters the house, Miranda can hear he's there and his reference to her captor as ""Franklin"". She can just reach the bathtub faucet with her foot and tries to turn it on to create some noise. Just as the Colonel is about to leave, Miranda is able to turn on the faucet. As the Colonel hears the noise, Freddie announces that he has a male cousin staying with him. As the Colonel gets distracted by other items in the house, the water starts to overflow from the bathtub. As the Colonel is about ready to leave for the second time, water starts flowing down the stairs which both Freddie and the Colonel notice. Freddie runs up the stairs announcing that it is really his girlfriend staying there. He manages to go into the bathroom to have a discussion with his ""girlfriend"" about the water problem, while in the meantime turning off the faucet, unplugging the drain and tying Miranda up tighter. Freddie comes back out and announces to the satisfied Colonel that the problem was a faucet handle that came off and that his girlfriend didn't call out because of the embarrassment of being caught unmarried in a compromising position in a man's house. After the Colonel leaves, Freddie unties Miranda. Both are silent, but Freddie brings the towel further up to cover her otherwise unclad body, then leaves her to let her dress in peace.As Miranda exits the bathroom, Freddie is waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs. She requests that he tie her hands in front rather than behind since it hurts less. He obliges. Before heading back to the basement, Freddie shows her his massive butterfly collection, which includes some exotic specimens he raised from larvae sent to him from other parts of the world, some breeds which he developed himself, and some still live specimens.

When he mentions in passing his time working at the bank in Reading, she remembers him in the news about winning the pools. She tries to persuade him to do something more meaningful with his life with those moneys.Days later, Miranda is doing a pencil self-portrait as she looks in the mirror. Freddie asks her if she would consider selling it. She makes the asking price £200. He agrees. She doesn't understand why anyone would want it as she thinks it's garbage. She tears it out of her sketch pad, hands it to him and tells him to keep it with his butterflies. She seems out of sorts, he believes because she has not yet written her letter to her family. Handing her some nondescript stationery, he starts to dictate what she can write in that letter: that she is safe and well looked after. As she is addressing the envelope she tries to distract him by offering him another one of her sketches on the wall for free. As he turns to choose one, she slips another note in the envelope along with the dictated letter. He hands her the chosen sketch which he asks her to sign. She sarcastically signs it ""prisoner #..."" As he seals the envelope, he feels around its edges and can feel something extra inside. He opens it to see the second note. It basically tells that her captor's name is Gerald Franklin, he being the winner of the football pools. But what he is offended by is the statement that she is frightened. They begin to argue, he accusing that she still looks down on him and so would her friends and her type.

As he exits, he tears up the letter in front of her stating that it would have done no good since they are not in Reading and his real name is not Franklin.On ""freedom"" day, Miranda is wearing her own clothes as Freddie brings her a tray of food.

When she reminds him of the day and their agreement, he tells her that she will be released at midnight. As she sits down dejected, they begin to talk about ""The Catcher in the Rye"".

Freddie heads upstairs to his own bedroom to retrieve a box. He brings it back down for Miranda, telling her it is for this evening. He leaves her alone to let her open the box in peace.Later that evening, Freddie comes down to see that Miranda is wearing the evening dress that he bought for her. They will be having supper upstairs tonight, and he isn't even tying her hands for the walk up. She is pleased. She walks upstairs with enthusiasm to see a candlelit table complete with champagne and caviar. As they talk about life in the immediate future, she notices he has had her sketch framed. As they sit down to eat, she finds a ring box in her napkin. He asks her to marry him, the marriage to be in name only. She would live at the house but be free to do whatever she pleases, even sleep in another bedroom. She replies that that is not marriage; marriage is belonging wholeheartedly to another person. But she does agree to marry him. With a sinister look in his eyes, he states that to get married, they would require witnesses, implying that he is not letting her have her freedom. As she understands that implication, she runs toward any door trying to get out. She eventually runs into the butterfly collection room. He corners her with chloroform in his hands.

"23","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059740/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","A steam engine pulls it's cars through a mountainous canyon and on into the Clearwater Station, at Clearwater, Texas. Sheriff Billy Wilson (Paul Fix) and his deputy, Ben Latta (Jeremy Slate), along with Tom Elder (Dean Martin), Bud Elder (Michael Anderson, Jr.), and Matt Elder (Earl Holliman), were all waiting. Tom attempts to get his brothers to bet with him on exactly how close to a spot on the platform the train will stop. They refuse, disgusted that Tom would think of gambling when they were there for a funeral.The only passenger who disembarks is a rough looking character, unknown to any of them. The man asks the sheriff where the town was and the sheriff points down the road. saying, ""you can't miss it."" Tom, Matt, and Bud get on their horses and ride away, figuring whomever it was they were expecting had decided not to come.At a ranch outside Clearwater, one of the buildings is marked, ""Hastings Firearms Manufacturing."" Gun shots ring out. Morgan Hastings (James Gregory), the owner of the ranch and the firearms manufacturing business, is sighting in a rifle. A man named Curley (George Kennedy), approaches Hastings. Curley is the man who came in on the train that afternoon. Hastings asks Curley if anyone else got off the train. He was specifically interested in whether John Elder (John Wayne) might have come to town. Curley said he didn't know John Elder, but had heard of him, and figures Elder must be afraid of John Elder and therefore decided to hire him (Curley was a gunfighter). Hastings tells Curley that he may not need to use his gun at all, and may very well be on his way out of town in a few days without having to do anything. Curley didn't care, as long as he got paid. He takes his saddlebags and bedroll and goes to set up quarters in the ranch house.Sheriff Wilson and Ben return to town and walk to their office, passing the church and a horse-drawn hearse being tended to by the local undertaker. The sheriff removes his gun belt, but the deputy keeps his on. The sheriff wants to know why the deputy planned to wear his gun to the funeral, since John Elder didn't get off the train, and there shouldn't be any trouble. The deputy knows that John could still show up, and he's also concerned about the stranger, Curley, who did get off the train. Sheriff Wilson cautions Ben that John Elder isn't wanted for anything around there. Ben reminds the sheriff that just being a gunfighter puts John on the opposite side of the law, just as the sheriff had taught him in the first place.The funeral was for Katie Elder. She was being laid to rest next to her husband, Bass, who'd preceded her in death by about six months. As the ceremony at the gravesite comes to an end, John Elder can be seen observing from high in the nearby rocks.One of the local men approached the Elder brothers and told them that Katie once sold him a blind horse and really suckered him good. He seemed to admire that Katie, a woman, had fooled him like that. A young woman with a baby in her arms stepped up next and told the brothers that the baby's name was Katie, named after their mother.The parson spoke to the three brothers, asking them if one of them was missing. They confirmed that the oldest brother, John, was not there. The parson was upset that he couldn't have delivered better words about Katie, even though the brothers told him he had delivered a very good eulogy. He told them it wasn't good enough, that she deserved much more, but then he didn't expect the brothers to understand that.After everyone had left the gravesite, the undertaker motioned to four boys and they prepared to lower the coffin into the ground. After they'd gone, John Elder came to the grave and paused to reflect and pay his respects. He's observed from afar by Curley.As John stands there, holding his hat, he hears a noise behind him. He whirls around and at the same time, flings his hat and draws his gun. The hat strikes Sheriff Billy in the chest and John aims his pistol at Billy. John pauses, acknowledging the sheriff, then admonishes him for coming up behind him quietly like that. Billy asks John why he came into town the back way. John tells him that he wanted to avoid any trouble, and there's always somebody looking for trouble.The sheriff asked John how long he planned to be around. John wonders if there's some reason he should be in a hurry to move on. Billy tells John there are several reasons why he shouldn't stick around: 1) you don't belong here anymore, 2) there's another man new to town, a hired gun, and 3) my deputy is very conscientious about his job. John suggests that Billy send Ben over to run that new guy out of town, but Billy has to admit that he doesn't know the man, much less if he is wanted for anything.John tells the sheriff that he just wanted to see his mother buried and to visit his brothers, then he'd leave. The sheriff is fine with that, and points the direction that John should go to see his brothers. John points the opposite direction and says, ""but the ranch is over there,"" and Billy tells him that the family doesn't live on the old ranch anymore, that the ranch now belongs to Morgan Hastings. Billy tells John that his pa was killed about six months ago, and he hasn't been able to find out who did it. Sensing that John probably wants to find out who did it, Billy cautions John not to do anything foolish, but when John says, ""you've been trying real hard not to tell me something, Billy, what is it,"" Billy just turns and walks away.Curley rushes to see Hastings and tell him that John Elder was there afterall. Hastings tells Curley that if anything happens, such as a gunfight, that Curley should make it look like self-defense. He tells Curley to do nothing, unless and until he tells him to. Hastings son, Dave (Dennis Hopper), witnesses the conversation and becomes very upset, realizing that the Elder boys are likely to start asking questions about how the Hastings came into ownership of the ranch.John rides out to the Lupin place, where his mother was living when she died and where his brothers are staying. At the ranch house, Bud, who was very young when John left, is asking Tom and Matt if John is as fast as everyone says he is. Tom tells him that when John was younger, he was so fast, that it was scary. Tom realizes that Bud is thinking he'd like to be like his oldest brother, so he advises Bud to consider some other line of work, such as gambling, which is much safer than gun fighting. Just as Bud was wishing John had come for the funeral, Matt looks out the window and says, ""he's here,"" and they go outside to meet him.The brothers all greet one another jovially. John learns that Bud is supposed to return for his second year of college, something Katie had always very much wanted him to do. John asked how their mother died. Bud tells him that Doctor Isdell told them that she just wore herself out, had a stroke, and lost the ability to talk. That's when the preacher wrote the letters to John.Matt said he came back to see Katie about three years ago. Tom accused Matt of hitting her up for money to put into his hardware business. Matt said at least he came back to see her, which is more than Tom or John did.Bud asks John if it's true what they say about him. He specifically wanted to know how many men John had killed. John was saved from having to answer by the sounds of a wagon coming up to the house. It was Mary Gordon (Martha Hyer), bringing a picnic basket of food for the brothers. Mary operated the boarding house in town. She tells John that she was the skinny little kid who used to live next door to the Mastersons. She tells the brothers that Katie asked her to look in on them, if they bothered to come to the funeral.Mary told the brothers that their mother always talked about how proud she was of all of them, how they sent her money regularly, and how they were helping put Bud through college. Mary observed that their mother thus lied about them all the time. She said Katie blamed Texas for taking her older three boys away from her, but she wasn't going to let Bud fall prey. She said she'd see Bud through college, or die. She died.There was a rocking chair in the house that Mary said was given to Katie by her husband, Bass, and she wouldn't have swapped it for a diamond ring. Bass had his faults, but Katie loved him dearly. John thanks Mary for being so nice to their mother, but Mary responded, much like the parson did, by criticizing the brothers for not treating Katie better. She then stormed out of the house. When John chased her down and started to say something, she looks at him somewhat in disgust and said, ""I see you're still wearing that gun,"" then she flips the reins and drives off.Bud tells his brothers that he didn't want to go to college, but it was that or jail. He explained that he was accused of stealing a horse, when all he did was go for a ride on it. His mother wanted him to go to college, so she wouldn't back him up on his claim of innocence about the horse. The college he was sent to was the Colorado School of Mines in Colorado Springs.John began wondering why Katie would sell 1,200 acres of the best land in the area, after Bass died. Regardless of the reason, Matt figures there must be money in the bank from the sale of the ranch, so he wants to go check that out and divide the money four ways. That leads to a discussion about Bud going back to college, which he says he's not going. He plans to ride with John. John says, ""there's one little thing you're forgetting, you ain't been invited."" Tom said he'd take Bud with him, but he didn't know where he was going, just that it wouldn't be anyplace he'd already been.As the brothers prepare to go to the bank, John pauses, while looking at his mother's rocking chair, then hangs his gun belt on the coat hook, leaving it behind. In town, John fires off orders to his brothers, sending them to the funeral parlor, the general store and the doctor's office to see if there are any debts that needed to be settled for Katie.Tom and Bud go first to see Mr. Peevey (Percy Helton) at the general store. Katie owed $6.20 to Mr. Peevey. Tom offers to settle things by cutting a deck of cards, with the high card winning, and the wager being double or nothing. Peevey just laughs, then walks over to the bottom of a staircase and calls out to his mother. He wants to know how much they owed Katie Elder for some dresses and guitar lessons she'd provided. The total came to $11, so he paid Tom $4.80. Tom is curious as to why his mother would need guitar lessons, so Peevey explains that he thought his mother could play guitar in the saloon and make some extra money.John goes to see the undertaker, Henry Hyselman (John Doucette), who tells him that Katie pre-paid her funeral by giving him a gray horse. John asked if that was the same gray horse that Bud stole. Hyselman laughed and admitted that he and Katie rigged that whole matter up to scare Bud into going to college. John then asked Henry if he'd buried their father. Henry said yes. He then told John about the time Thad challenged Bass to a duel. Bass had the choice of weapons, so he chose Roman candles, since it was the 4th of July. No one got hurt, although one of the fireballs went down Bass' pants and he had to sit down in the watering trough. John and Henry had a good laugh about that.John then asked how Bass died. Henry became very uncomfortable, but admitted that it was obvious Bass had been shot in the back. He didn't have any idea who did it, or if anyone tried to find out. Hastings is standing inside his gun business, there in town, across from Hyselman's business, with Curley and another of his men, wondering what John was doing talking to Hyselman for so long. Curley asks Hastings if he wants him to go ask. Hastings thinks that's a good idea, but insists that Curley do nothing more than talk.John reunites with his brothers and they walk over to see Mr. Vennar (James Westerfield), the banker. Mr. Vennar isn't any more cordial to the brothers than most anyone else in town. He said there wasn't even $1 left in Katie's bank account. He said she scraped together what she needed through doing sewing and giving guitar lessons. He told the brothers that if they bothered to look in her closet, they'd find one blue dress for winter and one gray dress for summer. That's all she had for clothes. The Lupin place didn't belong to her either. The bank allowed her and Bud to live there so they'd have a roof over their heads. Katie insisted on paying rent, nevertheless.Mr. Vennar dismisses the brothers, but not before Matt asks about the money for sale of the Elder's ranch. Vennar says he didn't know anything about the sale of the ranch, and any records that may have existed were destroyed in a recent fire. He added that he couldn't remember every transaction. As John leaves, he pauses, looks back at Vennar and says, ""Every transaction, or just this one?"" and then he turns and leaves.Curley walks over to see Mr. Hyselman, demanding to know what he and John Elder were talking about. Hyselman tells him it's none of his business. Curley said that Mr. Hastings wanted to know. Hyselman said he didn't care what Mr. Hastings wanted and tells Curley to leave. Curley grabs Hyselman and forces his head into a large vat of water. John comes walking through the entrance just about then, sees what's happening, looks around, then grabs an ax handle that is sitting nearby. He yells ""hey!"" to Curley, and when Curley looks up, John swings the ax handle flush across Curley's face, knocking him down and out.Hyselman catches his breath and tells John that he thinks the bad guy works for Morgan Hastings, and was trying to find out what they'd been talking about. He further explains how Hastings is bent upon trying to take over the entire county, and had already acquired the Elder's old place. John hands Curley's pistol to Hyselman, then offers money to Henry to look after Katie's grave. Henry refuses the money, telling John it would be his pleasure to do it. John thanks him and, after once last glance at the unconscious Curley, he leaves.John tells his brothers that he wants to go out and look at the old home place, telling them he's ""homesick."" As they ride up on a ridge overlooking the ranch, Matt recalls the times they used to play in the barn. Bud claimed to remember Tom falling out of the loft and breaking his leg. Tom told Bud he wasn't even born yet when that happened, and said he didn't fall, that someone pushed him. He said someone was always pushing him out of that loft. John said, ""that's because you bounced so good. Everybody in the family kept bragging about how good you bounced.""They ride on down to the house and John knocks on the door. Dave Hastings answers and he's very agitated. He tells John that they are on private property, that his father isn't there, and they should just leave. Deputy Ben Latta comes riding up right then and asks Dave if there's trouble. Dave tells the deputy that he ordered the Elders to leave and they were refusing. Ben is already on edge, having learned of how John roughed up Curley in town, and he says he won't stand for any more trouble.Latta tells the Elders to leave, or be arrested. When John says they wouldn't take too kindly to being arrested, Latta draws his gun. Tom, sitting on his horse next to Latta, is able to jump over and knock the deputy off his horse. John grabs the deputy's gun. Tom jumps up and says, ""see, now we ain't arrested."" Latta tells them they are in trouble for resisting arrest. John tells him they are all going back into town with him, to straighten things out, but they aren't going in looking guilty. He orders Latta to get on his horse and looks back at Dave and tells him that they'll be back.They all ride into town, Latta in the lead, the brothers riding side-by-side behind him. They explain what happened to Sheriff Wilson and the sheriff tells Latta that next time, he should wait until he's told to go after somebody before he goes riding off. Sheriff Wilson tells the Elders to take off, but John and Tom follow him into his office, wanting to talk to him.John and Tom ask Billy questions about their father and the ranch. Billy says that Hastings told him Bass lost the ranch to him while gambling. There were six witnesses to the event. Billy figures Bass must have been pretty drunk to lose his ranch in a card game. When they find out Bass was shot the same night that he lost the ranch, John says, ""Well, now wouldn't you say that was a little coincidental, Billy?"" Billy just says nothing could be proven. They offer to help Billy figure out who shot Bass, but Billy wants them to let it go, and to stop digging around because it will just result in trouble.John decides they should go see Hastings next. On the way, he sees Mary getting some things out of a box on her wagon. He approaches her and tells her that the brothers would like her to have any of Katie's things that she thinks she'd like to have, such as the rocking chair. Mary thanks him and says she'd like that very much. John tells her he'd bring them by. Tom notices a mutual attraction between John and Mary and accuses John of forcing himself on Mary.John and Tom go into Hasting's gun shop, where Hastings is showing off a couple of dueling pistols to Bondie Adams (Rodolfo Acosta) and Curley. Strangely enough, there are no marks on Curley's face, so apparently, he was a fast healer.Hastings expresses condolences to John and Tom about their mother, and tells them that after Bass died, he offered to pay Katie for the ranch, out of a sense of guilt. He admits that he needed the ranch for it's water supply, to power a mill and help the town grow. He believed the town could become important. John asks to see the paper that transferred the ranch. Hastings shows it to him. He then asks if the six witnesses who signed the transfer all worked for Hastings. Hastings said that they did. John then asks what the game was that he and Bass were playing when they bet on the ranch. Hastings says it was blackjack. John looks at Tom and recalls that Bass used to say that he'd shoot any of his kids he caught playing blackjack, and that he thought it was a woman's game.Tom asks Hastings who he thinks the low down dirty rat was that shot their pa. When Hastings says, ""why ask me?"" John says, ""well, we aim to find out,"" and he and Tom leave. Outside, Tom reminds John that they started playing blackjack when they were 3 or 4 years old. John says, ""yeah, we know that, but Hastings doesn't.""Back at the ranch, the brothers sort through Katie's belongings, burning papers that aren't of use anymore. John takes a worn bible from the closet and reads the following entries:""Katie Dwayne; born Ohio, no date; married Bass Elder, September 8, 1850, Clearwater, Texas.""John says they better keep that bible. Tom jumps up and asks why. He thinks they should raffle it, and maybe give half the money to the parson. Matt thinks they should get a nice stone for their mother's grave. They then argue about what to get, perhaps a marble statuette, say of an angel, or a lamb. Then Tom suggests it be a marble horse and the others are aghast. John asks what's become of all of them. He tells them that their mother just wanted one of them to amount to something, and they still had a chance to do that, with Bud and college.Bud again argues that he doesn't want to be the monument to his mother. He wants to be a gunfighter, like John, and for them to be famous like the Dalton brothers. John tells him the Dalton brothers were dead, that they were hung. Bud just says, ""oh."" John finally proclaims, ""we keep the book!""John rides into town, after dark, carrying the rocking chair and the picnic basket that Mary had brought out earlier. He takes it into the boarding house, says hello to Mary, and places the rocker in front of the fireplace. He also hands her Katie's bible. She doesn't feel right taking the family bible, but he insists, so she tells him he can have it back whenever he wants it. Mary goes to a drawer and takes out a bundle of letters that she hands to John. They were the letters he'd written to Katie long ago. She had let Mary read them. Mary said she had noticed from the letters how John changed over time, even though Katie didn't.Mary asks John if he's trying to find out who killed his father. He says yes, that whomever shot him most likely also stole the ranch, so it's the least he could do for his mother. Mary tells him that killing Bass' murderer would just be another bad example for Bud, showing him what a big tough guy his big brother is, and how shooting people is worthy of worship. She tells John that Katie just wanted Bud to go to college and make the Elder name stand for something. John gets upset and throws the letters into the fireplace. He starts to walk out, but turns back when she thanks him again for the rocking chair and bible. He asks Mary why Katie wouldn't want him to find Bass' killer. She tells him because it would result in more killing, and Katie hated killing.Tom and Bud go into the bar and Tom asks Bud for some money to buy drinks. Bud doesn't have any money and suggests that Tom use his own money. Tom is insulted, saying that their father would come out of his grave if Tom used his own money to buy a drink. Nevertheless, he buys them each one shot of whiskey, then sets out to demonstrate to Bud how to go about avoiding paying for any more drinks. He puts on a black eye patch and pretends to remove one of his eyes, revealing a glass eye in the palm of his hand. He says it's worth $22. He calls out to the bar patrons that he's conducting a raffle for the glass eye. The bartender tells Tom that if he wants a drink that bad, he'd give him one, but Tom refuses and continues with the raffle.Tom sells $10 worth of chances on the glass eye, then puts 9 white chips and 1 blue chip in a hat. Each man who bought chances draws out a chip. Jeb Ross (Strother Martin) bought two chances, so on his second draw, he comes up with the blue chip and wins the eye. Tom immediately offers to buy the eye back from Jeb, for $3, which would give Ross a profit of $2. Ross says no, so Tom says he needs the eye in order to get married, because his girl doesn't like his eye patch. Ross considers, and after the rest of the men encourage him to return the eye, he asks Tom for $5. Tom says, ""split the difference and I'll buy you a drink."" Jeb agrees and it's a deal. When Tom puts the glass eye back in it's little carrying case, Ross asks him why he doesn't put it back in his skull. Tom lifts the eye patch and says, ""it'd be a little crowded in there,"" as he moves both of his eyes back and forth. Everyone roars with laughter at the joke.Curley is also in the saloon, playing cards. He decides to confront Tom, telling him he didn't think his little trick was funny, then calling Tom a liar and a cheat, just like his old man. Tom steps back and assumes a position for drawing his gun. Bud jumps in and calls Curley a liar for the things he said about Bass. Curley decides Bud's words are fighting words and orders someone to give Bud a gun. Bondie Adams offers his gun, sliding it along the bar towards Bud. Before Bud can grab the gun, Tom grabs him in a bear hug. Right then, John enters the bar and Bud tells him, ""this guy just called pa a liar and a drunk."" Bud, suddenly feeling even more emboldened, then asks Curley if the invitation to draw goes for Johnny Elder as well.John tells Tom to get Bud out of the bar. Bud refuses to go until Curley pays for what he said. John looks at Bud and pauses, then tells Bud that their father really was a liar and a drunk, upon which he grabs Bud and pushes him sharply towards the door and tells Tom to keep him out. John eyes the pistol on the bar and Curley starts giggling. Sheriff Wilson then appears on the scene, carrying a shotgun. He points it at Curley and tells John to get out. John leaves. When Curley and his co-horts begin to walk out, the sheriff tells them to stay and finish their game.The next morning at breakfast, Bud throws a fit, as he's upset about the way Curley talked about their father, and he thinks big brother John slinked away from the fight like a low-life skunk. John tells him to shut up. When Bud tells John that he should have let him fight Curley, John tells him that Curley would have killed him before his hand got halfway to that gun. John tells Bud that Katie wanted him to go to college and that's what he's going to do. Bud acknowledges that his big brother might be able to force him to go, but he couldn't make him learn anything.Bud rushes to a cabinet and extracts a pistol, telling his brothers that he was going after Curley and asking if any of them were coming with him. John grabs the pistol away from Bud, then backhands him across the face. When Bud tries to throw a punch back at him, John takes the punch against his hand and flings Bud back across the room. He then tosses the pistol onto the table, accidentally knocking a cup of coffee over into Tom's lap. Tom jumps up and punches John. John hits him back, knocking him towards Matt. Matt sort of pushes Tom, who then turns and punches Matt. Matt then hits Tom. After that, there are many more punches delivered and received among all the brothers, until John gets knocked through the front door and raises up to see a man in a wagon sitting there.The man and John exchange ""howdys,"" then the man says he's looking for Kate Elder. When he learns that Kate had died, he expresses his condolences, then explains how she wrote to him about a month ago. He produces the letter, addressed to Mr. Charlie Bob Striker (Rhys Williams), Pecos, TX. In the letter, Kate offers to purchase between 100-200 horses from Mr. Striker, if he's willing to sell them to her on credit and allow her time to resell them so she could pay him what's owed.Charlie figures there will be no deal now, since Katie had passed, and he is all set to leave when John tells him that he'd be interested in taking the 200 horses. He said he'd run them up to Colorado and sell them to the miners, but he'd need to also do it on credit. He offers Striker half the profits for trusting him. Striker asks the other brothers if they are going to be in on it. Tom and Matt say ok, as long as the profits go towards Bud's college. Bud hesitates, complaining that John almost broke his jaw. John says, ""I was trying awful hard too, but that's what it seems to take with some people."" After Tom nudges Bud, he agrees to go along.Striker says that as long as he was going to do a fool thing for their mother, he would go ahead and do it for them. He heads off for his ranch down near Pecos to wait for them. Ben Latta comes riding into town and stops to speak with Morgan Hastings. They go over to see Sheriff Wilson, who's at the jail playing chess with Judge Harry Evers (Sheldon Allman). He's lost eight games in a row to Harry. Ben thrusts a wanted poster at Billy. On the poster is a reproduction of Tom Elder, and he's wanted for murder. Ben tells him that Hastings put him on the trail of investigating Tom, and that's how he came upon the poster.After Judge Evers explains to Ben that the wanted poster doesn't mean Tom is guilty, just that's he's wanted, Billy cautions Ben that he's operating out of pure hate in his pursuit of the Elder brothers, and that's why they took Ben's gun from him the first time. Ben walks over to the gun rack and gets a rifle, then some bullets. He tells Billy he's going after Tom. Billy criticizes Ben for being so ready to get tough with Tom, advising him that it would be better to go out there as though he's reluctant to arrest Tom. Seeing that Ben can't be reasoned with, Billy decides he'll go out to the ranch on his own.Ben and Hastings can't believe Billy is willing to go by himself and Hastings offers the services of Curley. Billy asks Hastings what it is he's trying to keep the Elders from finding out about. Hastings responds, ""just trying to help.""Hastings beats Billy out to the ranch and lies in wait behind a tree on a hillside. When Billy rides up to the ranch house, Hastings shoots him in the back with a rifle. Billy's horse trots back to town, where Judge Evers sees him and tells Ben. Ben puts together a posse and they ride out to the ranch and find Billy still breathing, but barely alive. Two men are assigned to take Billy to the doctor. The rest of the posse head out to find the Elders.The Elder brothers have gone to Pecos and gathered the 200 horses. They are just starting out on the long drive to Colorado, pausing at the river to spend the night. John compliments Bud on his horse wrangling during the day and asked him where he learned to do that. Bud just says, ""not in college!"" Another argument about his going to college ensues and John complains to his other two brothers that he doesn't know what to do about Bud's continuing sassiness. Tom says to Bud, ""ain't you go no respect for your elders?"" Bud says, ""ha, ha, I've heart that before."" When he's told that Katie wouldn't have stood for his back talk, Bud asks which of them thought they were able to stand in for their mom and put him in his place.John, Tom and Matt then grab Bud and fling him into the river. Tom and Matt jump in too and douse him a couple of more times. When John tells them all that he thought he'd taught them better than to jump in the river with their clothes on, they grab him and pull him in.The next morning, Tom spots the posse on a nearby ridge. When he asks John what they should do, John says they hadn't done anything wrong, so not to act like they had. They mount up and prepare to resume the drive, when Bondie Adams raises his rifle and shoots, spooking Bud's horse who bucks and knocks Bud out of the saddle. Ben yells at Bondie for disobeying orders, but the posse then rides on down to confront the Elders.John asks Ben what's going on. Ben infers they were stealing horses. John tells him they acquired the horses legally and could prove it, although he didn't expect them to believe him. He said Billy would believe him. That's when Ben accused them of shooting Billy when he'd tried to bring Tom in, and he shows them the wanted poster. John glances at Tom, not understanding, but then tells Ben that it doesn't make sense that they'd be on the run with Tom, shoot Billy, stop to pick up 200 horses, then herd the horses back through Clearwater. Ben just tells them to throw their guns on the ground. John tells his brothers to comply, that more killings won't prove anything.The brothers are worried about their horses, but Ben doesn't seem to care about that, ordering his posse members to kill the Elders if they try to escape. In jail, Tom explains that some bartender in New Orleans got upset when he pulled his fake eye trick and started shooting at him, so he had to shoot back. He didn't think he'd get a fair trial, so he ran.Outside the jail, the men of the town had gathered and were talking about a lynch party for the Elders. Mary comes to see them, bringing food. John asks her about Billy, but she doesn't know his condition. When John suggests that she too thinks they shot Billy, she says she doesn't know what to think. She just wishes they'd gone away right after the funeral. Ben comes up and tells Mary to go home. He also says that Billy's dead. Matt asks if Billy said anything about who shot him. Ben says he wasn't able to say that the brothers didn't shoot him.Mary lashes out at Ben, telling him he needs to get the U.S. Marshall, or take the Elders to Laredo, because they won't get a chance to make their case there in Clearwater. Ben tells her to quit telling him how to do his job. It appears that Ben would just as soon let the towns people string up the brothers.Tom produces a knife he had hidden away and tells his brothers that come breakfast time in the morning, they'll get the key.Judge Evers confirms Mary's opinion, telling Ben that they wouldn't be able to find a jury capable of providing a fair trial for the Elders. Ben asks Charlie Biller (John Qualen), an older deputy, if they have enough ammunition to see them through. Charlie says no, that their guns won't stop that mob anyway. He complains to the judge that Billy could have dispersed that mob, and without using a gun. He doesn't think Ben amounts to a patch on Billy's shirt. He tells Ben he needs to get the Elders out of town, or pretty soon he'll be shooting bullets at the people who used to be his friends. Ben thinks about it and tells the judge they'll move the Elders to Laredo early the next morning.During the night, there seems to be some activity going on, as though Ben was going to open the cell door, so Bud wakes Tom, but no one comes. Tom gets his knife out and tells Bud to call out and tell the deputies that he's sick. John kicks the knife out of Tom's hand, telling him they were going to face the charges. He tells Tom that they landed in jail because he chose to run in New Orleans, but not now. Even if they all get killed, they aren't running, and that's a win for Katie. He throws the knife out the window.The deputies come to take the Elders to Laredo. The first stop is J. Plummer Blacksmith shop, where they have shackles put on. Bud refuses to be shackled to John, so Matt angrily shoves Bud out of the way and steps up to be shackled to John. The judge deputizes the additional men who will be transporting the Elders.In a canyon outside Clearwater, Morgan and Dave Hastings, Curley, and Bondie Adams are waiting in ambush. The three wagon drivers carrying the Elders and the deputies are part of the ambush plan, which is to kill everyone and blame the Elders. Ned, the driver of the wagon carrying the brothers, stops on a river crossing bridge, claiming it was to rest the horses. John senses something's up, and taps Matt on the shoulder, a signal to get ready. He leans forward as Ned stands up and shouts something, then pushes Ned out of the wagon while simultaneously grabbing the pistol from his holster. He shouts at his brothers to jump. John and Matt go off one side of the bridge and Tom and Bud go off the other.Hastings and his men start shooting. The man riding with Ben draws his gun and orders Ben to drop his rifle. John shoots back, but tells his brothers that he can't hold them off with one gun. Tom asks him if he can provide cover long enough for he and Bud to run back to Ben's wagon and get more guns. John says, ""three shots worth."" Tom and Bud get in the river and swim under water a short distance and get to the wagon. Ben had been taken off to the side by his captor, near some trees. Tom grabs a rifle and sees Ben and the other man. He shoots and hits the man, wounding him, and although he's still able to hold his pistol on Ben, he decides he'd better run for it.John yells at Tom to use the horses on the wagon for cover in getting back over to him and Matt. They make the short run to the bridge, then jump in the river with several rifles and boxes of ammo, and make their way over to John and Matt. Seeing all that, Hastings turns to Curley and says, ""all right, Curley, this is what you were hired for. I don't want one of them lizards to get out of here alive."" Bondie goes with Curley as they ride down to where the other men are, near the river. One man tells Curley that there's dynamite in his wagon.Things get real quiet while Curley and another man configure a bunch of dynamite sticks into a bomb. The Elders decide to fall back a bit, to the other side of the bridge, but before they can, Curley yells go and six of the men charge, shooting at the Elders while Curley lights the fuse and tosses the bomb under the bridge, then they all fall back. Things get quiet again and John hears the sizzling of the fuse. When he sees the bomb, he yells, ""look out!"" as he dives into the water. The dynamite goes off, causing the bridge to collapse.When John struggles up out of the water, he finds Matt on his back with a large splinter of timber in his stomach. Matt tries to say something about a wish that he has, but he dies before he can say it. Curley and his gang all start shooting again. Ben is nearby, but helpless to do anything. John grabs two pistols and furiously empties them at the bad guys, but doesn't hit anybody. Then he grabs a rifle and shoots some more. He finally calms down a bit and waits for Curley to stick his face out from behind the tree he was hiding behind, then shoots him in the head.After seeing Curley go down, another man breaks from behind his tree and runs. John cuts him down too. Bud is hit in the upper left chest and freaks out. Tom tends to him while John shoots his shackle to release him from Matt. Ben comes out of hiding and calls out to the Elders to throw him a gun and he'd help them. Hastings calls Ben a ""stupid fool"" and prepares to shoot him, but Dave grabs his arm and pulls his gun down. Hastings knocks Ben down and re-aims at Ben. As Ben leaps for the pistol that John flings to him, his body is violently jerked backwards by the force of the bullet from Hasting's rifle.When the remaining men see Hastings turning to leave, they all decide it's time to go as well. John and Tom shoot at them as they leave, but don't hit anybody. Tom wants to run, but John tells him that Bud needs a doctor and he's using the one wagon to take him to Clearwater. John drives the buckboard into Clearwater at full speed, going right to the blacksmith's shop. He tells Tom to get Bud in the barn, while he provides cover. One man across the street is about to start shooting, but the judge stops him.Will, the blacksmith, tells his son, who is there working with him, to get out of there, but John tells the boy to go get Dr. Isdell and be quick about it. The boy goes for the doctor while John orders the blacksmith to take off their leg irons. One man stops the boy, but Judge Evers tells him to let him go. Evers then approaches the blacksmith's shop and John fires off a shot, telling him to stop. Evers tells John to send out Will and they'll let the doctor come through. John says it will have to be the other way around.John explains what happened at the bridge outside town, and also quickly relates the brothers' alibi for the time when Billy was shot and killed. He tells Evers to send for the U.S. Marshall in Laredo and they'd give themselves up to him. Evers sends Dr. Isdell into the barn. Tom releases the blacksmith. Evers orders all the men gathered around to break it up and go home, or they'd have to answer to the U.S. Marshall.Dr. Isdell does what he can for Bud, suggesting to John and Tom that they get the boy over to the boarding house as soon as possible. John then opens the door so the doctor can leave. Tom assures John that Bud will pull through and they'll see to it that he gets raised right.Hastings and his son are anxiously waiting over in the gun shop. Dave is worried that one of the deputies will tell the U.S. Marshall what happened. Morgan doesn't think so. He gets upset at his son's lighting up a cigarette in the shop, where's there's gunpowder, and forcibly smashes the cigarette against his son's mouth. Dave goes outside to smoke and pout. Tom sees him and calls to John. Tom wants to go get Dave, ask him some questions. John says no, that if Tom steps outside, he'd be killed. John then goes to tend to Bud.Tom sets down his rifle and takes a pistol, climbs into the loft, and goes out a window. On the street, he takes a horse to provide cover as he crosses the road. He manages to avoid detection by several men he passes and makes his way over to the gun shop. He comes up behind Dave and puts his gun in his back, ordering him to walk backwards. Morgan sees Dave's strange movement through the window and realizes something's amiss. He goes to the side door and sees Tom pointing his gun at Dave. Morgan breaks a pane of glass in the door with his pistol and fires, hitting Tom in the middle of his back. Tom is wounded, but returns fire and is able to keep going, ordering Dave to move. Morgan follows and more shots are exchanged, but Morgan decides to give up the chase as Tom nears the blacksmith shop and the towns people start gathering again, attracted by the sounds of gunfire.Tom pushes Dave into the barn and says to John, ""here's a present for ya, now get your answers."" John proceeds to interrogate Dave, asking who it was that ambushed them outside of town. When Dave says he didn't know, John hits him twice, then starts choking him. Morgan appears at another doorway and witnesses what's going on. He again breaks a pane of glass and fires off a shot, but he hits his son, as John had spun Dave, putting him between him and the door.As Dave stumbles forward, telling his father that he didn't tell them anything, John quickly grabs his rifle. Morgan starts to withdraw, only Judge Evers shows up and draws down on Hastings, ordering him to drop his gun. Hastings quickly tries to explain that the Elders shot at him, and had his son in there. As Evers opens the door to the barn, Hastings runs off.Before he dies, Dave tells John that his father killed Ben, that Bass Elder found out he was being cheated, so Hastings killed him too, and that Billy kept getting closer to the truth, so he had to go as well. Judge Evers hears all of it, then orders John to give up his gun, telling John that they'd take care of Hastings. John says, ""I don't want any trouble with you, Harry."" Tom says, ""I wouldn't argue with him,"" just before he topples over face first, unconscious.Harry tries once more to stop John, but he tells Harry that he has to do this for himself and, as he walks out, tells Harry to go get Dr. Isdell for Tom. John marches directly over towards the gun shop, but pauses when the lights start to dim. He sneaks up and kicks the front door open. Hastings fires off some shots at him. John dives into the store and takes cover near some barrels of gunpowder. They exchange more shots, but realizing they were in a bit of a standoff, John decides to position a smaller container of explosive out in the middle of the floor, then he dives out the side door and runs back around to the front. While standing in the street, he fires a shot into that container, causing it to explode. The entire store then blows up.John turns and hands his gun to Judge Evers, then slowly walks towards the blacksmith shop. Mary calls out to him and he turns and walks to her. She tells him that Bud is in the boarding house. She says doc told her that Bud would require lots of care. John tells her he'll get it. He asks about Tom. She says the doctor was with him now, but that Tom said it would take more than one bullet to kill him. As John follows Mary to go see Bud, he pushes against Katie's rocking chair, putting it in motion.The end.","

    Synopsis
    A steam engine pulls it's cars through a mountainous canyon and on into the Clearwater Station, at Clearwater, Texas. Sheriff Billy Wilson (Paul Fix) and his deputy, Ben Latta (Jeremy Slate), along with Tom Elder (Dean Martin), Bud Elder (Michael Anderson, Jr.), and Matt Elder (Earl Holliman), were all waiting. Tom attempts to get his brothers to bet with him on exactly how close to a spot on the platform the train will stop. They refuse, disgusted that Tom would think of gambling when they were there for a funeral.The only passenger who disembarks is a rough looking character, unknown to any of them. The man asks the sheriff where the town was and the sheriff points down the road. saying, ""you can't miss it."" Tom, Matt, and Bud get on their horses and ride away, figuring whomever it was they were expecting had decided not to come.At a ranch outside Clearwater, one of the buildings is marked, ""Hastings Firearms Manufacturing."" Gun shots ring out. Morgan Hastings (James Gregory), the owner of the ranch and the firearms manufacturing business, is sighting in a rifle. A man named Curley (George Kennedy), approaches Hastings. Curley is the man who came in on the train that afternoon. Hastings asks Curley if anyone else got off the train. He was specifically interested in whether John Elder (John Wayne) might have come to town. Curley said he didn't know John Elder, but had heard of him, and figures Elder must be afraid of John Elder and therefore decided to hire him (Curley was a gunfighter). Hastings tells Curley that he may not need to use his gun at all, and may very well be on his way out of town in a few days without having to do anything. Curley didn't care, as long as he got paid. He takes his saddlebags and bedroll and goes to set up quarters in the ranch house.Sheriff Wilson and Ben return to town and walk to their office, passing the church and a horse-drawn hearse being tended to by the local undertaker. The sheriff removes his gun belt, but the deputy keeps his on. The sheriff wants to know why the deputy planned to wear his gun to the funeral, since John Elder didn't get off the train, and there shouldn't be any trouble. The deputy knows that John could still show up, and he's also concerned about the stranger, Curley, who did get off the train. Sheriff Wilson cautions Ben that John Elder isn't wanted for anything around there. Ben reminds the sheriff that just being a gunfighter puts John on the opposite side of the law, just as the sheriff had taught him in the first place.The funeral was for Katie Elder. She was being laid to rest next to her husband, Bass, who'd preceded her in death by about six months. As the ceremony at the gravesite comes to an end, John Elder can be seen observing from high in the nearby rocks.One of the local men approached the Elder brothers and told them that Katie once sold him a blind horse and really suckered him good. He seemed to admire that Katie, a woman, had fooled him like that. A young woman with a baby in her arms stepped up next and told the brothers that the baby's name was Katie, named after their mother.The parson spoke to the three brothers, asking them if one of them was missing. They confirmed that the oldest brother, John, was not there. The parson was upset that he couldn't have delivered better words about Katie, even though the brothers told him he had delivered a very good eulogy. He told them it wasn't good enough, that she deserved much more, but then he didn't expect the brothers to understand that.After everyone had left the gravesite, the undertaker motioned to four boys and they prepared to lower the coffin into the ground. After they'd gone, John Elder came to the grave and paused to reflect and pay his respects. He's observed from afar by Curley.As John stands there, holding his hat, he hears a noise behind him. He whirls around and at the same time, flings his hat and draws his gun. The hat strikes Sheriff Billy in the chest and John aims his pistol at Billy. John pauses, acknowledging the sheriff, then admonishes him for coming up behind him quietly like that. Billy asks John why he came into town the back way. John tells him that he wanted to avoid any trouble, and there's always somebody looking for trouble.The sheriff asked John how long he planned to be around. John wonders if there's some reason he should be in a hurry to move on. Billy tells John there are several reasons why he shouldn't stick around: 1) you don't belong here anymore, 2) there's another man new to town, a hired gun, and 3) my deputy is very conscientious about his job. John suggests that Billy send Ben over to run that new guy out of town, but Billy has to admit that he doesn't know the man, much less if he is wanted for anything.John tells the sheriff that he just wanted to see his mother buried and to visit his brothers, then he'd leave. The sheriff is fine with that, and points the direction that John should go to see his brothers. John points the opposite direction and says, ""but the ranch is over there,"" and Billy tells him that the family doesn't live on the old ranch anymore, that the ranch now belongs to Morgan Hastings. Billy tells John that his pa was killed about six months ago, and he hasn't been able to find out who did it. Sensing that John probably wants to find out who did it, Billy cautions John not to do anything foolish, but when John says, ""you've been trying real hard not to tell me something, Billy, what is it,"" Billy just turns and walks away.Curley rushes to see Hastings and tell him that John Elder was there afterall. Hastings tells Curley that if anything happens, such as a gunfight, that Curley should make it look like self-defense. He tells Curley to do nothing, unless and until he tells him to. Hastings son, Dave (Dennis Hopper), witnesses the conversation and becomes very upset, realizing that the Elder boys are likely to start asking questions about how the Hastings came into ownership of the ranch.John rides out to the Lupin place, where his mother was living when she died and where his brothers are staying. At the ranch house, Bud, who was very young when John left, is asking Tom and Matt if John is as fast as everyone says he is. Tom tells him that when John was younger, he was so fast, that it was scary. Tom realizes that Bud is thinking he'd like to be like his oldest brother, so he advises Bud to consider some other line of work, such as gambling, which is much safer than gun fighting. Just as Bud was wishing John had come for the funeral, Matt looks out the window and says, ""he's here,"" and they go outside to meet him.The brothers all greet one another jovially. John learns that Bud is supposed to return for his second year of college, something Katie had always very much wanted him to do. John asked how their mother died. Bud tells him that Doctor Isdell told them that she just wore herself out, had a stroke, and lost the ability to talk. That's when the preacher wrote the letters to John.Matt said he came back to see Katie about three years ago. Tom accused Matt of hitting her up for money to put into his hardware business. Matt said at least he came back to see her, which is more than Tom or John did.Bud asks John if it's true what they say about him. He specifically wanted to know how many men John had killed. John was saved from having to answer by the sounds of a wagon coming up to the house. It was Mary Gordon (Martha Hyer), bringing a picnic basket of food for the brothers. Mary operated the boarding house in town. She tells John that she was the skinny little kid who used to live next door to the Mastersons. She tells the brothers that Katie asked her to look in on them, if they bothered to come to the funeral.Mary told the brothers that their mother always talked about how proud she was of all of them, how they sent her money regularly, and how they were helping put Bud through college. Mary observed that their mother thus lied about them all the time. She said Katie blamed Texas for taking her older three boys away from her, but she wasn't going to let Bud fall prey. She said she'd see Bud through college, or die. She died.There was a rocking chair in the house that Mary said was given to Katie by her husband, Bass, and she wouldn't have swapped it for a diamond ring. Bass had his faults, but Katie loved him dearly. John thanks Mary for being so nice to their mother, but Mary responded, much like the parson did, by criticizing the brothers for not treating Katie better. She then stormed out of the house. When John chased her down and started to say something, she looks at him somewhat in disgust and said, ""I see you're still wearing that gun,"" then she flips the reins and drives off.Bud tells his brothers that he didn't want to go to college, but it was that or jail. He explained that he was accused of stealing a horse, when all he did was go for a ride on it. His mother wanted him to go to college, so she wouldn't back him up on his claim of innocence about the horse. The college he was sent to was the Colorado School of Mines in Colorado Springs.John began wondering why Katie would sell 1,200 acres of the best land in the area, after Bass died. Regardless of the reason, Matt figures there must be money in the bank from the sale of the ranch, so he wants to go check that out and divide the money four ways. That leads to a discussion about Bud going back to college, which he says he's not going. He plans to ride with John. John says, ""there's one little thing you're forgetting, you ain't been invited."" Tom said he'd take Bud with him, but he didn't know where he was going, just that it wouldn't be anyplace he'd already been.As the brothers prepare to go to the bank, John pauses, while looking at his mother's rocking chair, then hangs his gun belt on the coat hook, leaving it behind. In town, John fires off orders to his brothers, sending them to the funeral parlor, the general store and the doctor's office to see if there are any debts that needed to be settled for Katie.Tom and Bud go first to see Mr. Peevey (Percy Helton) at the general store. Katie owed $6.20 to Mr. Peevey. Tom offers to settle things by cutting a deck of cards, with the high card winning, and the wager being double or nothing. Peevey just laughs, then walks over to the bottom of a staircase and calls out to his mother. He wants to know how much they owed Katie Elder for some dresses and guitar lessons she'd provided. The total came to $11, so he paid Tom $4.80. Tom is curious as to why his mother would need guitar lessons, so Peevey explains that he thought his mother could play guitar in the saloon and make some extra money.John goes to see the undertaker, Henry Hyselman (John Doucette), who tells him that Katie pre-paid her funeral by giving him a gray horse. John asked if that was the same gray horse that Bud stole. Hyselman laughed and admitted that he and Katie rigged that whole matter up to scare Bud into going to college. John then asked Henry if he'd buried their father. Henry said yes. He then told John about the time Thad challenged Bass to a duel. Bass had the choice of weapons, so he chose Roman candles, since it was the 4th of July. No one got hurt, although one of the fireballs went down Bass' pants and he had to sit down in the watering trough. John and Henry had a good laugh about that.John then asked how Bass died. Henry became very uncomfortable, but admitted that it was obvious Bass had been shot in the back. He didn't have any idea who did it, or if anyone tried to find out. Hastings is standing inside his gun business, there in town, across from Hyselman's business, with Curley and another of his men, wondering what John was doing talking to Hyselman for so long. Curley asks Hastings if he wants him to go ask. Hastings thinks that's a good idea, but insists that Curley do nothing more than talk.John reunites with his brothers and they walk over to see Mr. Vennar (James Westerfield), the banker. Mr. Vennar isn't any more cordial to the brothers than most anyone else in town. He said there wasn't even $1 left in Katie's bank account. He said she scraped together what she needed through doing sewing and giving guitar lessons. He told the brothers that if they bothered to look in her closet, they'd find one blue dress for winter and one gray dress for summer. That's all she had for clothes. The Lupin place didn't belong to her either. The bank allowed her and Bud to live there so they'd have a roof over their heads. Katie insisted on paying rent, nevertheless.Mr. Vennar dismisses the brothers, but not before Matt asks about the money for sale of the Elder's ranch. Vennar says he didn't know anything about the sale of the ranch, and any records that may have existed were destroyed in a recent fire. He added that he couldn't remember every transaction. As John leaves, he pauses, looks back at Vennar and says, ""Every transaction, or just this one?"" and then he turns and leaves.Curley walks over to see Mr. Hyselman, demanding to know what he and John Elder were talking about. Hyselman tells him it's none of his business. Curley said that Mr. Hastings wanted to know. Hyselman said he didn't care what Mr. Hastings wanted and tells Curley to leave. Curley grabs Hyselman and forces his head into a large vat of water. John comes walking through the entrance just about then, sees what's happening, looks around, then grabs an ax handle that is sitting nearby. He yells ""hey!"" to Curley, and when Curley looks up, John swings the ax handle flush across Curley's face, knocking him down and out.Hyselman catches his breath and tells John that he thinks the bad guy works for Morgan Hastings, and was trying to find out what they'd been talking about. He further explains how Hastings is bent upon trying to take over the entire county, and had already acquired the Elder's old place. John hands Curley's pistol to Hyselman, then offers money to Henry to look after Katie's grave. Henry refuses the money, telling John it would be his pleasure to do it. John thanks him and, after once last glance at the unconscious Curley, he leaves.John tells his brothers that he wants to go out and look at the old home place, telling them he's ""homesick."" As they ride up on a ridge overlooking the ranch, Matt recalls the times they used to play in the barn. Bud claimed to remember Tom falling out of the loft and breaking his leg. Tom told Bud he wasn't even born yet when that happened, and said he didn't fall, that someone pushed him. He said someone was always pushing him out of that loft. John said, ""that's because you bounced so good. Everybody in the family kept bragging about how good you bounced.""They ride on down to the house and John knocks on the door. Dave Hastings answers and he's very agitated. He tells John that they are on private property, that his father isn't there, and they should just leave. Deputy Ben Latta comes riding up right then and asks Dave if there's trouble. Dave tells the deputy that he ordered the Elders to leave and they were refusing. Ben is already on edge, having learned of how John roughed up Curley in town, and he says he won't stand for any more trouble.Latta tells the Elders to leave, or be arrested. When John says they wouldn't take too kindly to being arrested, Latta draws his gun. Tom, sitting on his horse next to Latta, is able to jump over and knock the deputy off his horse. John grabs the deputy's gun. Tom jumps up and says, ""see, now we ain't arrested."" Latta tells them they are in trouble for resisting arrest. John tells him they are all going back into town with him, to straighten things out, but they aren't going in looking guilty. He orders Latta to get on his horse and looks back at Dave and tells him that they'll be back.They all ride into town, Latta in the lead, the brothers riding side-by-side behind him. They explain what happened to Sheriff Wilson and the sheriff tells Latta that next time, he should wait until he's told to go after somebody before he goes riding off. Sheriff Wilson tells the Elders to take off, but John and Tom follow him into his office, wanting to talk to him.John and Tom ask Billy questions about their father and the ranch. Billy says that Hastings told him Bass lost the ranch to him while gambling. There were six witnesses to the event. Billy figures Bass must have been pretty drunk to lose his ranch in a card game. When they find out Bass was shot the same night that he lost the ranch, John says, ""Well, now wouldn't you say that was a little coincidental, Billy?"" Billy just says nothing could be proven. They offer to help Billy figure out who shot Bass, but Billy wants them to let it go, and to stop digging around because it will just result in trouble.John decides they should go see Hastings next. On the way, he sees Mary getting some things out of a box on her wagon. He approaches her and tells her that the brothers would like her to have any of Katie's things that she thinks she'd like to have, such as the rocking chair. Mary thanks him and says she'd like that very much. John tells her he'd bring them by. Tom notices a mutual attraction between John and Mary and accuses John of forcing himself on Mary.John and Tom go into Hasting's gun shop, where Hastings is showing off a couple of dueling pistols to Bondie Adams (Rodolfo Acosta) and Curley. Strangely enough, there are no marks on Curley's face, so apparently, he was a fast healer.Hastings expresses condolences to John and Tom about their mother, and tells them that after Bass died, he offered to pay Katie for the ranch, out of a sense of guilt. He admits that he needed the ranch for it's water supply, to power a mill and help the town grow. He believed the town could become important. John asks to see the paper that transferred the ranch. Hastings shows it to him. He then asks if the six witnesses who signed the transfer all worked for Hastings. Hastings said that they did. John then asks what the game was that he and Bass were playing when they bet on the ranch. Hastings says it was blackjack. John looks at Tom and recalls that Bass used to say that he'd shoot any of his kids he caught playing blackjack, and that he thought it was a woman's game.Tom asks Hastings who he thinks the low down dirty rat was that shot their pa. When Hastings says, ""why ask me?"" John says, ""well, we aim to find out,"" and he and Tom leave. Outside, Tom reminds John that they started playing blackjack when they were 3 or 4 years old. John says, ""yeah, we know that, but Hastings doesn't.""Back at the ranch, the brothers sort through Katie's belongings, burning papers that aren't of use anymore. John takes a worn bible from the closet and reads the following entries:
""Katie Dwayne; born Ohio, no date; married Bass Elder, September 8, 1850, Clearwater, Texas.""John says they better keep that bible. Tom jumps up and asks why. He thinks they should raffle it, and maybe give half the money to the parson. Matt thinks they should get a nice stone for their mother's grave. They then argue about what to get, perhaps a marble statuette, say of an angel, or a lamb. Then Tom suggests it be a marble horse and the others are aghast. John asks what's become of all of them. He tells them that their mother just wanted one of them to amount to something, and they still had a chance to do that, with Bud and college.Bud again argues that he doesn't want to be the monument to his mother. He wants to be a gunfighter, like John, and for them to be famous like the Dalton brothers. John tells him the Dalton brothers were dead, that they were hung. Bud just says, ""oh."" John finally proclaims, ""we keep the book!""John rides into town, after dark, carrying the rocking chair and the picnic basket that Mary had brought out earlier. He takes it into the boarding house, says hello to Mary, and places the rocker in front of the fireplace. He also hands her Katie's bible. She doesn't feel right taking the family bible, but he insists, so she tells him he can have it back whenever he wants it. Mary goes to a drawer and takes out a bundle of letters that she hands to John. They were the letters he'd written to Katie long ago. She had let Mary read them. Mary said she had noticed from the letters how John changed over time, even though Katie didn't.Mary asks John if he's trying to find out who killed his father. He says yes, that whomever shot him most likely also stole the ranch, so it's the least he could do for his mother. Mary tells him that killing Bass' murderer would just be another bad example for Bud, showing him what a big tough guy his big brother is, and how shooting people is worthy of worship. She tells John that Katie just wanted Bud to go to college and make the Elder name stand for something. John gets upset and throws the letters into the fireplace. He starts to walk out, but turns back when she thanks him again for the rocking chair and bible. He asks Mary why Katie wouldn't want him to find Bass' killer. She tells him because it would result in more killing, and Katie hated killing.Tom and Bud go into the bar and Tom asks Bud for some money to buy drinks. Bud doesn't have any money and suggests that Tom use his own money. Tom is insulted, saying that their father would come out of his grave if Tom used his own money to buy a drink. Nevertheless, he buys them each one shot of whiskey, then sets out to demonstrate to Bud how to go about avoiding paying for any more drinks. He puts on a black eye patch and pretends to remove one of his eyes, revealing a glass eye in the palm of his hand. He says it's worth $22. He calls out to the bar patrons that he's conducting a raffle for the glass eye. The bartender tells Tom that if he wants a drink that bad, he'd give him one, but Tom refuses and continues with the raffle.Tom sells $10 worth of chances on the glass eye, then puts 9 white chips and 1 blue chip in a hat. Each man who bought chances draws out a chip. Jeb Ross (Strother Martin) bought two chances, so on his second draw, he comes up with the blue chip and wins the eye. Tom immediately offers to buy the eye back from Jeb, for $3, which would give Ross a profit of $2. Ross says no, so Tom says he needs the eye in order to get married, because his girl doesn't like his eye patch. Ross considers, and after the rest of the men encourage him to return the eye, he asks Tom for $5. Tom says, ""split the difference and I'll buy you a drink."" Jeb agrees and it's a deal. When Tom puts the glass eye back in it's little carrying case, Ross asks him why he doesn't put it back in his skull. Tom lifts the eye patch and says, ""it'd be a little crowded in there,"" as he moves both of his eyes back and forth. Everyone roars with laughter at the joke.Curley is also in the saloon, playing cards. He decides to confront Tom, telling him he didn't think his little trick was funny, then calling Tom a liar and a cheat, just like his old man. Tom steps back and assumes a position for drawing his gun. Bud jumps in and calls Curley a liar for the things he said about Bass. Curley decides Bud's words are fighting words and orders someone to give Bud a gun. Bondie Adams offers his gun, sliding it along the bar towards Bud. Before Bud can grab the gun, Tom grabs him in a bear hug. Right then, John enters the bar and Bud tells him, ""this guy just called pa a liar and a drunk."" Bud, suddenly feeling even more emboldened, then asks Curley if the invitation to draw goes for Johnny Elder as well.John tells Tom to get Bud out of the bar. Bud refuses to go until Curley pays for what he said. John looks at Bud and pauses, then tells Bud that their father really was a liar and a drunk, upon which he grabs Bud and pushes him sharply towards the door and tells Tom to keep him out. John eyes the pistol on the bar and Curley starts giggling. Sheriff Wilson then appears on the scene, carrying a shotgun. He points it at Curley and tells John to get out. John leaves. When Curley and his co-horts begin to walk out, the sheriff tells them to stay and finish their game.The next morning at breakfast, Bud throws a fit, as he's upset about the way Curley talked about their father, and he thinks big brother John slinked away from the fight like a low-life skunk. John tells him to shut up. When Bud tells John that he should have let him fight Curley, John tells him that Curley would have killed him before his hand got halfway to that gun. John tells Bud that Katie wanted him to go to college and that's what he's going to do. Bud acknowledges that his big brother might be able to force him to go, but he couldn't make him learn anything.Bud rushes to a cabinet and extracts a pistol, telling his brothers that he was going after Curley and asking if any of them were coming with him. John grabs the pistol away from Bud, then backhands him across the face. When Bud tries to throw a punch back at him, John takes the punch against his hand and flings Bud back across the room. He then tosses the pistol onto the table, accidentally knocking a cup of coffee over into Tom's lap. Tom jumps up and punches John. John hits him back, knocking him towards Matt. Matt sort of pushes Tom, who then turns and punches Matt. Matt then hits Tom. After that, there are many more punches delivered and received among all the brothers, until John gets knocked through the front door and raises up to see a man in a wagon sitting there.The man and John exchange ""howdys,"" then the man says he's looking for Kate Elder. When he learns that Kate had died, he expresses his condolences, then explains how she wrote to him about a month ago. He produces the letter, addressed to Mr. Charlie Bob Striker (Rhys Williams), Pecos, TX. In the letter, Kate offers to purchase between 100-200 horses from Mr. Striker, if he's willing to sell them to her on credit and allow her time to resell them so she could pay him what's owed.Charlie figures there will be no deal now, since Katie had passed, and he is all set to leave when John tells him that he'd be interested in taking the 200 horses. He said he'd run them up to Colorado and sell them to the miners, but he'd need to also do it on credit. He offers Striker half the profits for trusting him. Striker asks the other brothers if they are going to be in on it. Tom and Matt say ok, as long as the profits go towards Bud's college. Bud hesitates, complaining that John almost broke his jaw. John says, ""I was trying awful hard too, but that's what it seems to take with some people."" After Tom nudges Bud, he agrees to go along.Striker says that as long as he was going to do a fool thing for their mother, he would go ahead and do it for them. He heads off for his ranch down near Pecos to wait for them. Ben Latta comes riding into town and stops to speak with Morgan Hastings. They go over to see Sheriff Wilson, who's at the jail playing chess with Judge Harry Evers (Sheldon Allman). He's lost eight games in a row to Harry. Ben thrusts a wanted poster at Billy. On the poster is a reproduction of Tom Elder, and he's wanted for murder. Ben tells him that Hastings put him on the trail of investigating Tom, and that's how he came upon the poster.After Judge Evers explains to Ben that the wanted poster doesn't mean Tom is guilty, just that's he's wanted, Billy cautions Ben that he's operating out of pure hate in his pursuit of the Elder brothers, and that's why they took Ben's gun from him the first time. Ben walks over to the gun rack and gets a rifle, then some bullets. He tells Billy he's going after Tom. Billy criticizes Ben for being so ready to get tough with Tom, advising him that it would be better to go out there as though he's reluctant to arrest Tom. Seeing that Ben can't be reasoned with, Billy decides he'll go out to the ranch on his own.Ben and Hastings can't believe Billy is willing to go by himself and Hastings offers the services of Curley. Billy asks Hastings what it is he's trying to keep the Elders from finding out about. Hastings responds, ""just trying to help.""Hastings beats Billy out to the ranch and lies in wait behind a tree on a hillside. When Billy rides up to the ranch house, Hastings shoots him in the back with a rifle. Billy's horse trots back to town, where Judge Evers sees him and tells Ben. Ben puts together a posse and they ride out to the ranch and find Billy still breathing, but barely alive. Two men are assigned to take Billy to the doctor. The rest of the posse head out to find the Elders.The Elder brothers have gone to Pecos and gathered the 200 horses. They are just starting out on the long drive to Colorado, pausing at the river to spend the night. John compliments Bud on his horse wrangling during the day and asked him where he learned to do that. Bud just says, ""not in college!"" Another argument about his going to college ensues and John complains to his other two brothers that he doesn't know what to do about Bud's continuing sassiness. Tom says to Bud, ""ain't you go no respect for your elders?"" Bud says, ""ha, ha, I've heart that before."" When he's told that Katie wouldn't have stood for his back talk, Bud asks which of them thought they were able to stand in for their mom and put him in his place.John, Tom and Matt then grab Bud and fling him into the river. Tom and Matt jump in too and douse him a couple of more times. When John tells them all that he thought he'd taught them better than to jump in the river with their clothes on, they grab him and pull him in.The next morning, Tom spots the posse on a nearby ridge. When he asks John what they should do, John says they hadn't done anything wrong, so not to act like they had. They mount up and prepare to resume the drive, when Bondie Adams raises his rifle and shoots, spooking Bud's horse who bucks and knocks Bud out of the saddle. Ben yells at Bondie for disobeying orders, but the posse then rides on down to confront the Elders.John asks Ben what's going on. Ben infers they were stealing horses. John tells him they acquired the horses legally and could prove it, although he didn't expect them to believe him. He said Billy would believe him. That's when Ben accused them of shooting Billy when he'd tried to bring Tom in, and he shows them the wanted poster. John glances at Tom, not understanding, but then tells Ben that it doesn't make sense that they'd be on the run with Tom, shoot Billy, stop to pick up 200 horses, then herd the horses back through Clearwater. Ben just tells them to throw their guns on the ground. John tells his brothers to comply, that more killings won't prove anything.The brothers are worried about their horses, but Ben doesn't seem to care about that, ordering his posse members to kill the Elders if they try to escape. In jail, Tom explains that some bartender in New Orleans got upset when he pulled his fake eye trick and started shooting at him, so he had to shoot back. He didn't think he'd get a fair trial, so he ran.Outside the jail, the men of the town had gathered and were talking about a lynch party for the Elders. Mary comes to see them, bringing food. John asks her about Billy, but she doesn't know his condition. When John suggests that she too thinks they shot Billy, she says she doesn't know what to think. She just wishes they'd gone away right after the funeral. Ben comes up and tells Mary to go home. He also says that Billy's dead. Matt asks if Billy said anything about who shot him. Ben says he wasn't able to say that the brothers didn't shoot him.Mary lashes out at Ben, telling him he needs to get the U.S. Marshall, or take the Elders to Laredo, because they won't get a chance to make their case there in Clearwater. Ben tells her to quit telling him how to do his job. It appears that Ben would just as soon let the towns people string up the brothers.Tom produces a knife he had hidden away and tells his brothers that come breakfast time in the morning, they'll get the key.Judge Evers confirms Mary's opinion, telling Ben that they wouldn't be able to find a jury capable of providing a fair trial for the Elders. Ben asks Charlie Biller (John Qualen), an older deputy, if they have enough ammunition to see them through. Charlie says no, that their guns won't stop that mob anyway. He complains to the judge that Billy could have dispersed that mob, and without using a gun. He doesn't think Ben amounts to a patch on Billy's shirt. He tells Ben he needs to get the Elders out of town, or pretty soon he'll be shooting bullets at the people who used to be his friends. Ben thinks about it and tells the judge they'll move the Elders to Laredo early the next morning.During the night, there seems to be some activity going on, as though Ben was going to open the cell door, so Bud wakes Tom, but no one comes. Tom gets his knife out and tells Bud to call out and tell the deputies that he's sick. John kicks the knife out of Tom's hand, telling him they were going to face the charges. He tells Tom that they landed in jail because he chose to run in New Orleans, but not now. Even if they all get killed, they aren't running, and that's a win for Katie. He throws the knife out the window.The deputies come to take the Elders to Laredo. The first stop is J. Plummer Blacksmith shop, where they have shackles put on. Bud refuses to be shackled to John, so Matt angrily shoves Bud out of the way and steps up to be shackled to John. The judge deputizes the additional men who will be transporting the Elders.In a canyon outside Clearwater, Morgan and Dave Hastings, Curley, and Bondie Adams are waiting in ambush. The three wagon drivers carrying the Elders and the deputies are part of the ambush plan, which is to kill everyone and blame the Elders. Ned, the driver of the wagon carrying the brothers, stops on a river crossing bridge, claiming it was to rest the horses. John senses something's up, and taps Matt on the shoulder, a signal to get ready. He leans forward as Ned stands up and shouts something, then pushes Ned out of the wagon while simultaneously grabbing the pistol from his holster. He shouts at his brothers to jump. John and Matt go off one side of the bridge and Tom and Bud go off the other.Hastings and his men start shooting. The man riding with Ben draws his gun and orders Ben to drop his rifle. John shoots back, but tells his brothers that he can't hold them off with one gun. Tom asks him if he can provide cover long enough for he and Bud to run back to Ben's wagon and get more guns. John says, ""three shots worth."" Tom and Bud get in the river and swim under water a short distance and get to the wagon. Ben had been taken off to the side by his captor, near some trees. Tom grabs a rifle and sees Ben and the other man. He shoots and hits the man, wounding him, and although he's still able to hold his pistol on Ben, he decides he'd better run for it.John yells at Tom to use the horses on the wagon for cover in getting back over to him and Matt. They make the short run to the bridge, then jump in the river with several rifles and boxes of ammo, and make their way over to John and Matt. Seeing all that, Hastings turns to Curley and says, ""all right, Curley, this is what you were hired for. I don't want one of them lizards to get out of here alive."" Bondie goes with Curley as they ride down to where the other men are, near the river. One man tells Curley that there's dynamite in his wagon.Things get real quiet while Curley and another man configure a bunch of dynamite sticks into a bomb. The Elders decide to fall back a bit, to the other side of the bridge, but before they can, Curley yells go and six of the men charge, shooting at the Elders while Curley lights the fuse and tosses the bomb under the bridge, then they all fall back. Things get quiet again and John hears the sizzling of the fuse. When he sees the bomb, he yells, ""look out!"" as he dives into the water. The dynamite goes off, causing the bridge to collapse.When John struggles up out of the water, he finds Matt on his back with a large splinter of timber in his stomach. Matt tries to say something about a wish that he has, but he dies before he can say it. Curley and his gang all start shooting again. Ben is nearby, but helpless to do anything. John grabs two pistols and furiously empties them at the bad guys, but doesn't hit anybody. Then he grabs a rifle and shoots some more. He finally calms down a bit and waits for Curley to stick his face out from behind the tree he was hiding behind, then shoots him in the head.After seeing Curley go down, another man breaks from behind his tree and runs. John cuts him down too. Bud is hit in the upper left chest and freaks out. Tom tends to him while John shoots his shackle to release him from Matt. Ben comes out of hiding and calls out to the Elders to throw him a gun and he'd help them. Hastings calls Ben a ""stupid fool"" and prepares to shoot him, but Dave grabs his arm and pulls his gun down. Hastings knocks Ben down and re-aims at Ben. As Ben leaps for the pistol that John flings to him, his body is violently jerked backwards by the force of the bullet from Hasting's rifle.When the remaining men see Hastings turning to leave, they all decide it's time to go as well. John and Tom shoot at them as they leave, but don't hit anybody. Tom wants to run, but John tells him that Bud needs a doctor and he's using the one wagon to take him to Clearwater. John drives the buckboard into Clearwater at full speed, going right to the blacksmith's shop. He tells Tom to get Bud in the barn, while he provides cover. One man across the street is about to start shooting, but the judge stops him.Will, the blacksmith, tells his son, who is there working with him, to get out of there, but John tells the boy to go get Dr. Isdell and be quick about it. The boy goes for the doctor while John orders the blacksmith to take off their leg irons. One man stops the boy, but Judge Evers tells him to let him go. Evers then approaches the blacksmith's shop and John fires off a shot, telling him to stop. Evers tells John to send out Will and they'll let the doctor come through. John says it will have to be the other way around.John explains what happened at the bridge outside town, and also quickly relates the brothers' alibi for the time when Billy was shot and killed. He tells Evers to send for the U.S. Marshall in Laredo and they'd give themselves up to him. Evers sends Dr. Isdell into the barn. Tom releases the blacksmith. Evers orders all the men gathered around to break it up and go home, or they'd have to answer to the U.S. Marshall.Dr. Isdell does what he can for Bud, suggesting to John and Tom that they get the boy over to the boarding house as soon as possible. John then opens the door so the doctor can leave. Tom assures John that Bud will pull through and they'll see to it that he gets raised right.Hastings and his son are anxiously waiting over in the gun shop. Dave is worried that one of the deputies will tell the U.S. Marshall what happened. Morgan doesn't think so. He gets upset at his son's lighting up a cigarette in the shop, where's there's gunpowder, and forcibly smashes the cigarette against his son's mouth. Dave goes outside to smoke and pout. Tom sees him and calls to John. Tom wants to go get Dave, ask him some questions. John says no, that if Tom steps outside, he'd be killed. John then goes to tend to Bud.Tom sets down his rifle and takes a pistol, climbs into the loft, and goes out a window. On the street, he takes a horse to provide cover as he crosses the road. He manages to avoid detection by several men he passes and makes his way over to the gun shop. He comes up behind Dave and puts his gun in his back, ordering him to walk backwards. Morgan sees Dave's strange movement through the window and realizes something's amiss. He goes to the side door and sees Tom pointing his gun at Dave. Morgan breaks a pane of glass in the door with his pistol and fires, hitting Tom in the middle of his back. Tom is wounded, but returns fire and is able to keep going, ordering Dave to move. Morgan follows and more shots are exchanged, but Morgan decides to give up the chase as Tom nears the blacksmith shop and the towns people start gathering again, attracted by the sounds of gunfire.Tom pushes Dave into the barn and says to John, ""here's a present for ya, now get your answers."" John proceeds to interrogate Dave, asking who it was that ambushed them outside of town. When Dave says he didn't know, John hits him twice, then starts choking him. Morgan appears at another doorway and witnesses what's going on. He again breaks a pane of glass and fires off a shot, but he hits his son, as John had spun Dave, putting him between him and the door.As Dave stumbles forward, telling his father that he didn't tell them anything, John quickly grabs his rifle. Morgan starts to withdraw, only Judge Evers shows up and draws down on Hastings, ordering him to drop his gun. Hastings quickly tries to explain that the Elders shot at him, and had his son in there. As Evers opens the door to the barn, Hastings runs off.Before he dies, Dave tells John that his father killed Ben, that Bass Elder found out he was being cheated, so Hastings killed him too, and that Billy kept getting closer to the truth, so he had to go as well. Judge Evers hears all of it, then orders John to give up his gun, telling John that they'd take care of Hastings. John says, ""I don't want any trouble with you, Harry."" Tom says, ""I wouldn't argue with him,"" just before he topples over face first, unconscious.Harry tries once more to stop John, but he tells Harry that he has to do this for himself and, as he walks out, tells Harry to go get Dr. Isdell for Tom. John marches directly over towards the gun shop, but pauses when the lights start to dim. He sneaks up and kicks the front door open. Hastings fires off some shots at him. John dives into the store and takes cover near some barrels of gunpowder. They exchange more shots, but realizing they were in a bit of a standoff, John decides to position a smaller container of explosive out in the middle of the floor, then he dives out the side door and runs back around to the front. While standing in the street, he fires a shot into that container, causing it to explode. The entire store then blows up.John turns and hands his gun to Judge Evers, then slowly walks towards the blacksmith shop. Mary calls out to him and he turns and walks to her. She tells him that Bud is in the boarding house. She says doc told her that Bud would require lots of care. John tells her he'll get it. He asks about Tom. She says the doctor was with him now, but that Tom said it would take more than one bullet to kill him. As John follows Mary to go see Bud, he pushes against Katie's rocking chair, putting it in motion.The end.

During the course of the landing, both crews undergo a strange transformation. In a semi-hypnotic state, the crew of the Galliott savagely kill each other off. The only thing that prevents the Argos' crew from doing the same thing is Captain Markary (Barry Sullivan)'s resistance to the power that has overtake the others. Following some initial mayhem, Markary successfully manages to shake the others out of their trances. Not realizing that the other crew of the other spaceship is entirely decimated, the captain and several others make their way across the strange, uninhabited landscape, which is awash with bright colors and swirling mists, to see if they can be of any help. To their horror, the find the entire crew of the Galliott, including Markary's younger brother, to be dead.The men bury several of the bodies, but as most of the Galliott's crew are sealed into the control room, Markary and his men return to the Argos to retrieve the tools necessary to break through the doors. By the time he returns, the bodies in the control room have disappeared. The control room doors are now open, and all signs of violence has been erased. Only a puddle of blood, discovered by Wes (Angel Aranda), remains, but it is enough to convince Dr. Karen (Fernando Villena) that the captain did not imagine his macabre discovery. The crew return to the Argos thoroughly mystified by their situation. Soon after they leave, the grave markers start to shift outside the Galliott, heralding the return of the undead astronauts.Strange events begin to transpire. Though both ships were guided to the planet, no sign of life presents itself. Tiona (Evi Marandi), one of the crew persons, swears to Markary that she has seen some of the dead men from the Galliott walking nearby. Dr. Karen tries to assuage her fears that some unearthly force is at work, but soon even the captain is convinced that if there is any form of life on the plant, it is their enemy. The surviving crew attempts to leave the planet, but the damage done to the ship makes it impossible. Wes tells Markary that they will have to wait at least two days before the damage can be repaired.As more astronauts are mysteriously killed, tension among the crew continues to grow, and although Markary puts on a brave face, he confesses in his diary that he fears for the worst. During a land survey, Wes discovers another ship just a few miles from the Argos. Markary, together with Sanya (Norma Bengell) and Carter (Ivan Rassimov), walk over there to investigate the alien ship. Finding the calcified remains of the former crew, they determine that they are not the first ship to be lured into this trap. Narrowly avoiding being entombed in the interior of the ruined ship, Markary and Sanya escape back to the Argos, where they later find that Carter has mysteriously disappeared.Soon after, Kier (Federico Boido) and Sallas (Massimo Righi), two apparent survivors of the Galliott, appear at the Argos. Dr. Karan and Markary are both worried by their peculiar behavior and by the fact that neither one can explain where they have been since the landing. Karan observe that there is no disputing the fact that they are alive, to which Markary responds so it seems. Hearing this, Tiona reminds the captain the nothing is really what it seems on this planet. To set her mind at ease, Markary has several of the graves opened. In each one, nothing is left but the transparent plastic funeral shrouds in which the bodies were interred.Later that same night, Kier and Sallas are caught stealing a meteor rejecter from the control room. Though Kier is able to escape with the rejecter, Markary captures Sallas. Sallas real identity is revealed when the captain accidentally tears open the top of his uniform, revealing the body to be a mess of rotting flesh and exposed bone. 'Sallas' reveals that he is actually and alien being making use of the dead man's body. He goes on to tell Markary that since their sun has burned out, the planet is becoming uninhabitable, and that they are desperate to escape before they too perish. It is therefore necessary that they take possession of the astronauts in order to exist in a different atmosphere. 'Sallas' assures Markary that resistance is useless saying either all of us go back, or none of you will get there. The captain replies that he and his crew are willing to die in order to save their world, prompting the alien to vacate Sallas dead body. Markay realizes that one of power accessed through conformity. In order to maintain absolute control, it is necessary for the parasites to take posession of the entire crew, so as there is the slightest danger of rebellion, their control if thwarted.In a race against time, Markary and the final few survivors, whom include Sanya, Dr. Karan, and Tiona, go to the Galliott to retrieve the meteor rejecter, while Wes stays behind to guard the Argos. Markary decides that in order to ensure the destruction of the aliens, he plants a large explosive device on the Galliott while Sanya makes off with the meteor rejecter. But Dr. Karan and Tiona are killed in the subsequent battle with the re-animated astronauts. Markary and Sanya make it back to the Argos. The ship takes off with the three survivors just as the Galliott explodes.With the meteor rejecter in place, everything seems to be fine. But Wes is frightened by Markary's strange behavior. He confides his fears to Sanya, and together they confront the captain. Unfortunately for Wes, both Markary and Sanaya are now possessed by the alien beings. They offer to let him live in exchange for helping them fly to their home planet. Like Markary before him, Wes assures them that he would rather die than submit to them. Before being killed, Wes destroys the meteor rejecter.Without the meteor rejecter, the possessed Markary and Sanya realize that there is no way for the Argos to make it home. Instead they decide to stop at a closer planet less then a light year away. They are going to land on a strange planet called Earth, revealing that the astronauts are in fact not human at all, but from another distant planet. 'Sanya' tells 'Markary' that Earth is so small and thousands of years behind their planet in technology that its not even listed on most navigation charts since its population doesn't have the resources to travel beyond their planet. 'Sanya' asks 'Markary' how he thinks the people of Earth will react to them. ""I hope well... for them,"" he sneers.","

Karan observe that there is no disputing the fact that they are alive, to which Markary responds so it seems. Hearing this, Tiona reminds the captain the nothing is really what it seems on this planet. To set her mind at ease, Markary has several of the graves opened. In each one, nothing is left but the transparent plastic funeral shrouds in which the bodies were interred.Later that same night, Kier and Sallas are caught stealing a meteor rejecter from the control room. Though Kier is able to escape with the rejecter, Markary captures Sallas. Sallas real identity is revealed when the captain accidentally tears open the top of his uniform, revealing the body to be a mess of rotting flesh and exposed bone. 'Sallas' reveals that he is actually and alien being making use of the dead man's body. He goes on to tell Markary that since their sun has burned out, the planet is becoming uninhabitable, and that they are desperate to escape before they too perish. It is therefore necessary that they take possession of the astronauts in order to exist in a different atmosphere. 'Sallas' assures Markary that resistance is useless saying either all of us go back, or none of you will get there. The captain replies that he and his crew are willing to die in order to save their world, prompting the alien to vacate Sallas dead body. Markay realizes that one of power accessed through conformity. In order to maintain absolute control, it is necessary for the parasites to take posession of the entire crew, so as there is the slightest danger of rebellion, their control if thwarted.In a race against time, Markary and the final few survivors, whom include Sanya, Dr. Karan, and Tiona, go to the Galliott to retrieve the meteor rejecter, while Wes stays behind to guard the Argos. Markary decides that in order to ensure the destruction of the aliens, he plants a large explosive device on the Galliott while Sanya makes off with the meteor rejecter. But Dr. Karan and Tiona are killed in the subsequent battle with the re-animated astronauts. Markary and Sanya make it back to the Argos. The ship takes off with the three survivors just as the Galliott explodes.With the meteor rejecter in place, everything seems to be fine. But Wes is frightened by Markary's strange behavior. He confides his fears to Sanya, and together they confront the captain. Unfortunately for Wes, both Markary and Sanaya are now possessed by the alien beings. They offer to let him live in exchange for helping them fly to their home planet. Like Markary before him, Wes assures them that he would rather die than submit to them. Before being killed, Wes destroys the meteor rejecter.Without the meteor rejecter, the possessed Markary and Sanya realize that there is no way for the Argos to make it home. Instead they decide to stop at a closer planet less then a light year away. They are going to land on a strange planet called Earth, revealing that the astronauts are in fact not human at all, but from another distant planet. 'Sanya' tells 'Markary' that Earth is so small and thousands of years behind their planet in technology that its not even listed on most navigation charts since its population doesn't have the resources to travel beyond their planet. 'Sanya' asks 'Markary' how he thinks the people of Earth will react to them. ""I hope well... for them,"" he sneers.

                    In a near future, the American secret agent Lemmy Caution travels to Alphaville posing as the journalist Ivan Johnson from the Figaro-Pravda newspaper. His mission is to find the missing agent Henry Dickson and to convince Professor von Braun to come with him to Nueva York. Prof. von Braun is actually Leonard Nosferatu and has created the powerful computer Alpha 60 that has conceived the inhuman dystopian society of Alphaville, where love, conscience, poetry and emotion have been banished and words are systematically eliminated from the dictionary. Alpha 60 is also omnipresent and Lemmy has the assistance of Natacha von Braun, who is the daughter of von Braun. Soon he falls in love with Natacha but he needs to complete his mission before leaving Alphaville.

Scene:
Hotel
Johnson:My paper reserved a room for me: Ivan Johnson
-Which paper?
-Figaro-Pravda
Clerk: Room 344. Have you registered at Residents' Control?
You must, even if you're a Festival visitor
Johnson: Clear off!
Seductress: You're tired, sir?
You'd like to sleep, sir?
If you're tired, you can rest, sir.
The bedroom's here
[Johnson checks the walls]
Seductress: I'm checking if the Bible's here
-Do you believe in all that?
-Of course.
Seductress: I'll put the tranquilizers in the bathroom
I'm very well, thank you, you're welcome
Seductress: -Will you take a bath?
-Yes, I must think.
I'll help you, sir
I'll take your tie, sir
Johnson: Now what?
Seductress: I'll bathe you, if you like, sir
Johnson: I'm a big boy, sweetie; I can find my own dames
Clear off!
[Spy concealed in bathroom:] Be polite to the ladies, Mister Johnson
Johnson: Bloody hell, now what?
Spy: Don't you fancy this kid?
Johnson: How about your sister, Mister?
[Johnson kills spy]
I'm getting rusty
What's the game? Are you on narcotics?
Seductress: No, it's just normal
Johnson: Everything weird is ""normal"" in this hole
Sit in that chair
[Johnson takes photograph of Seductress]
Her name was Beatrice
She said she was a Seductress, Third Class
I was struck by her sad, yet hard, face
Something's not in orbit in the capital of this Galaxy
Johnson: Hold this up
[Johnson shoots a hole through each breast in a Vargas painting in magazine]
Johnson: Not bad for a veteran of Guadalcanal
Seductress: Just what I was thinking about you
Johnson: Go play your record elsewhere; I've heard it before
Yes?
[Voice:] Mister Johnson
Miss Natasha Vonbraun...
...has called for you
Johnson: Just a moment
[photo on bed: Leonard Vonbraun; bring back alive, or liquidate]
Johnson: Tell her I'll come down
[Voice:] She's on her way up
[photo on bed: Henry Dickson. Agent X21. 12, Enrico Fermi. Alphaville.]
Natasha: Got a light?
Johnson: I've traveled 9,000 kilometers to give it to you
Natasha: I'm Natasha Vonbraun
Johnson: Yes, I know
Natasha: How do you know?
Johnson: Miss Vonbraun?
Natasha: Yes, I'm very well, thank you, you're welcome
You've come from the Lands Without?
Johnson: Yes
Natasha: Everything to your satisfaction?
Johnson: Yes
Natasha: I've been ordered to remain at your service during your stay
Johnson: Who ordered you?
Natasha: The authorities, of course
Are you here for the Festival?
Johnson: Which Festival?
Natasha: The big one; that's what people from the Lands Without come for
It was silly not to have come earlier
The Festival's nearly over; it's the last till next year
Johnson: You don't say
Natasha: Yes, Mister Johnson
But this evening there is a Reception-Gala Performance
Very big
At a ministry. I'm going; come if you like
Johnson: What time? I must attend to something else first
Natasha: Residents' Control registration?
Johnson: No. What's that?
Natasha: You mustn't forget to go there. We can meet afterwards
Johnson: I'll go there tomorrow. First I must meet a friend
Natasha: I've work, too
I'll tell you where I'll be
Call for me and we'll go on together
See you in an hour or two
Johnson: See you then
I'll go down with you
Natasha: Mister Johnson, what's it like in the Lands Without?
Johnson: Haven't you been there?
Natasha: No, but my father told me about them when I was little
Now it's forbidden to think about them
Johnson: Are you often ordered to spend your time with strangers?
Natasha: Yes, it's my job
Johnson: How nice for you. Aren't you ever propositioned?
Natasha: What?
Johnson: Has no one ever fallen in love with you?
Natasha: In love? What's that?
Johnson: There's one thing I'd like to know
Natasha: Yes, Mister Johnson?
Johnson: Just how big of a fool do you take me for?
Answer me
Natasha: I can't understand what you're talking about
Johnson: Check, Princess! I can't make head or tail of what you're talking about
That's how it is, you never understand anything
Yes, that's always how it is; you never understand anything
Until one fine day you die of it
Scene:
Hotel Lobby
Natasha: Which way are you going?
Johnson: 12, Enrico Fermi
Near Heisenberg Boulevard, near Mathematical Park
Natasha: I can give you a lift
I'll get the keys
I'm very well, thank you, you're welcome
Johnson: You don't want me to flirt with you?
Natasha: What?
Johnson: You really don't know what it means?
[nods yes]
Her smile and her small pointed teeth...
...reminded me of an old vampire film...
...the sort they used to show at cinerama museums
[car drives away]
Natasha: I'm a Programmer, Second Class
Johnson: Natasha's a name from the past
Natasha: Yes, but...
...the present is all one can know in life
No one's lived in the past, or will live in the future
Johnson: Thanks for the lift, anyway
Natasha: It's a pleasure to do my job, Mister Johnson
Johnson: Is it much farther?
[Driver:] You know we must cross the north zone, Miss?
Johnson: What's the population?
Natasha: Don't forget, you must go to Residents' Control
What exactly do you do for a living?
Johnson: I work

But Dr. Maitland finds that Marco is indispensable when it comes to finding the kind of morbid curios he requires for his research. One night, Marco arrives with something quite special: a book bound in human skin. It was the creation of the notorious sadist, the Marquis de Sade. But Marco means the book only to whet the curious doctor's appetite. The next night he brings de Sade's own skull. The trouble is, the skull is reputed to be possessed by a spirit, which in turn possesses the minds of those who own it. The skull's former owner, Sir Matthew Phillips, is certainly glad to be rid of it. Dr. Maitland tries to dismiss the stories about the skull, but then come the nightmares. And then his nightmares become real.

                    Young, attractive and vivacious, model Diana Scott is firmly decided to become rich and famous as well. To succeed, she does not hesitate to take bold steps. After a while, she literally strikes gold: she meets Robert Gold, a well-known TV journalist, who not only introduces her into new social and professional circles, but also abandons his family to live with her. Diana seems to have happily combined success and love. However, in those roaring sixties, others are ready to offer her even more money, fame, and, seemingly, fun than Robert can...

                    Twenty-something Italian Princess della Romita, better known to her British fans as Sussex born Diana Scott, is giving an interview to a reporter in which she describes her life. She is straightforward about the facts. She worked as a London based model, her most famous job being as the Honeyglow girl, and had a moderately successful stint as an actress in small roles both on film and in commercials. She married her first husband Tony Bridges when they were both quite young, but she left him when she fell into an unplanned relationship with television journalist Robert Gold, who was at the time married himself with a family. Although she and Robert never married, they lived together for some time. She and Robert split after she fell into an unplanned relationship with advertising executive Miles Brand, who was the one who discovered her as the Honeyglow girl. She met her current husband, the Prince Cesare della Romita while she was working and vacationing in Italy. But behind these facts, she is less than forthright about her emotions in each of these moves, and the motivations for them. If she was forthright, she would expose herself as the vain and self-centered person she is, who was most understood by Miles, but who Robert began to understand, albeit too late.

                    Diana Scott is a young London model who decides to climb the social ladder quickly by jumping, rather fecklessly, in and out of assorted beds. She is a reckless seeker of self caught up in a frenzied sexcursion of jet-set Europe, in search of new experiences and finding emptiness at every level. Sardonically comic observations on various forms of self-indulgence among the wealthy emphasize the false values which have destroyed Diana's chance of genuine self-fulfillment.

                    In 1930's New Orleans, Eric Stoner, better known as the Cincinnati Kid in the circles in which he travels, is an up and coming gambler, most specifically in back room games of stud poker. When the older Lancey Howard comes to town, he who is known as the best in the game, the Kid wants to play him and win so that his reputation will rise in gambling circles. The Kid's friend Shooter arranges the game easily as the Kid's reputation precedes him. In the lead up to the game, the Kid faces numerous distractions including: Christian, his girlfriend who wants more of a commitment from him; Melba, Shooter's sluttish wife, who lets it be known she is willing to cheat on Shooter just like she cheats on everything else in life; and the increasing betting odds against him in the big game. The wealthy William Jefferson Slade tries to blackmail Shooter, the dealer, into rigging the game in the Kid's favor solely to get back at Lancey. Problems may ensue for the Kid because of the attempted blackmail, regardless of if Shooter buckles under the pressure.

                    Sisters Ingrid and Patti Randall are fending for themselves in the family home in Santa Monica while their parents are traveling abroad. Patti's Siamese cat DC - short for Darn Cat - is a chronic and resourceful explorer, he heading out every night at 9pm in what is usually his successful search for food, with Patti believing he having a standard route through the neighborhood every night. It's after one of DC's night outings that he returns home with what Patti believes is a clue to a criminal case, a $250,000 bank robbery where the two masked robbers abducted teller Margaret Miller in the process, she still missing and assumed alive and being held hostage by the robbers. Patti is correct in all her assumptions. Patti brings her suspicions to the FBI, who assigns Agent Zeke Kelso to this aspect of the case. In trying to discover the robbers' hideout and hopefully a still alive Margaret, Zeke and his team have to track DC on his night outings to see where he goes. This task may be a difficult one not only because they don't know how effectively to track a cat, especially an independently minded one like DC, but because Zeke is allergic to cat hair, something he failed to mention when he joined the agency and something, if known, could mean the end of his career. Who may factor into the investigation more than Zeke would want is Patti, who Ingrid describes as being over-dramatic and who wants to do her small part in finding Margaret. But as Patti and eventually Ingrid try to hide the fact of the FBI being based out of their house in not wanting to tip off any of their activities, they may face the problems of people constantly interested in the goings-on in the Randall house: their nosy and judgmental next door neighbor Mrs. MacDougall, whose snooping exasperates her husband; Canoe Henderson, Patti's surfing-obsessed boyfriend who has had unobstructed access to the Randall kitchen and the abundance of free food in it; and Gregory Benson, the driver of Ingrid's now two person work carpool, Gregory a mama's boy of a man who sees Ingrid as his imminent Mrs. regardless of what Ingrid may think. The two robbers - Dan and Iggy - have their own issues in dealing with a nosy landlady, whose primary interest is to get as much financially out of her new tenants as possible.

"33","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059711/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In 1864, widower Charlie Anderson is a prosperous Virginia farmer. Together with his six sons (Jacob, James, Nathan, John, Henry and Boy), Charlie runs his farm without the help of slaves. Because of this, he ignores the Civil War raging around them and discourages his sons from enlisting. Other family members are his only daughter, Jennie, and James's pregnant wife Ann. Charlie's wife Martha died sixteen years earlier at the birth of their youngest son, known as Boy. He periodically visits Martha's grave and talks to her. It was her last request that the family attend church each Sunday. They are usually late and create a disturbance while looking for seats. The family is visited by a group of men who have come to requisition supplies and horses for the Confederate Army. Charlie refuses to let them have anything and explains his stance on the war: why should he fight or allow his sons to fight for a cause that does not concern them. He is reminded that by law the men can take whatever they want. A fist fight ensues, which Jennie eventually stops by shooting off a shotgun. She orders them off the property and they leave. A regiment of soldiers stop at the farm and the captain attempts to conscript the Anderson sons. Charlie refuses to let them go, as usual. A skirmish occurs shortly afterward and many soldiers are killed on the Anderson property. Charlie sends two of his sons to the Confederate camp to report the skirmish so the bodies can be collected. Jennie is being courted by Sam, a young Confederate officer. He asks for and receives permission to marry her. Charlie gives him some sage advice about marriage. Jennie wears her mother's wedding gown. Just as the ceremony ends, a soldier enters the church and tells Sam he is wanted back at camp. Jennie is left alone at the altar, wondering if she will ever see her bridegroom again. Ann goes into labor after the wedding and gives birth to a daughter. Charlie is delighted to have a granddaughter. She is eventually named Martha, after her grandmother. While exploring with his African American friend, Gabriel, Boy is taken prisoner by Yankee soldiers. They don't believe he is not a soldier because of the Confederate cap he is wearing. Gabriel runs back to tell Charlie, who says that now the war concerns them. That night Charlie and his sons, all but James who will stay with Ann, pack up and ride out to visit prison camps in search of Boy. Jennie insists on going with them. They search several camps and hijack a prison train but there is no sign of Boy. However, Jennie is reunited with Sam, who was on board the train. Charlie tells the prisoners they are free. They ask Sam, as the only officer, what they should do. He tells them to go home as the war is lost. That night the family makes camp in a deserted house. Charlie fixes up the bedroom so Jennie and Sam can have their wedding night. The next day they discuss what to do now. Their food supplies are almost gone and the horses need rest. Charlie admits that they are unlikely to find Boy. They start for home and Jacob is shot and killed by a young soldier mistaking them for Yankees. Charlie beats the boy and nearly kills him before he realizes that he is the same age as his missing son. Boy has been in a prison camp but escapes with another prisoner. They travel toward Virginia but are caught up in a battle. Boy's leg is injured and he can't move. To his surprise, Gabriel, now wearing a Yankee uniform, picks him up and carries him to safety. Meanwhile, the Anderson farm was invaded by three men; obviously drifters. They kill James and Ann but do not harm the baby. Dr. Witherspoon, the family physician and a personal friend, discovers the bodies two days later. Having no idea where the rest of the family is, he arranges a nurse for the baby and has James and Ann buried near Martha. The Andersons arrive home and are devastated at the news. Jacob joins his brother and sister-in-law in the family graveyard. It is hard for Charlie to sit down to a table with so many empty chairs. He chokes up and goes to the graveyard, where he once again talks to Martha. He tells her she will like Ann. When the church bells start to ring, Charlie realizes it is Sunday. He orders his surprised family to get ready for church. As usual they are late and the baby is fussy. Then the door opens again and Boy limps in, leaning on a crutch. The congregation begins singing the Doxology as Charlie embraces his son.","

    Synopsis
    In 1864, widower Charlie Anderson is a prosperous Virginia farmer. Together with his six sons (Jacob, James, Nathan, John, Henry and Boy), Charlie runs his farm without the help of slaves. Because of this, he ignores the Civil War raging around them and discourages his sons from enlisting. Other family members are his only daughter, Jennie, and James's pregnant wife Ann. Charlie's wife Martha died sixteen years earlier at the birth of their youngest son, known as Boy. He periodically visits Martha's grave and talks to her. It was her last request that the family attend church each Sunday. They are usually late and create a disturbance while looking for seats. The family is visited by a group of men who have come to requisition supplies and horses for the Confederate Army. Charlie refuses to let them have anything and explains his stance on the war: why should he fight or allow his sons to fight for a cause that does not concern them. He is reminded that by law the men can take whatever they want. A fist fight ensues, which Jennie eventually stops by shooting off a shotgun. She orders them off the property and they leave. A regiment of soldiers stop at the farm and the captain attempts to conscript the Anderson sons. Charlie refuses to let them go, as usual. A skirmish occurs shortly afterward and many soldiers are killed on the Anderson property. Charlie sends two of his sons to the Confederate camp to report the skirmish so the bodies can be collected. Jennie is being courted by Sam, a young Confederate officer. He asks for and receives permission to marry her. Charlie gives him some sage advice about marriage. Jennie wears her mother's wedding gown. Just as the ceremony ends, a soldier enters the church and tells Sam he is wanted back at camp. Jennie is left alone at the altar, wondering if she will ever see her bridegroom again. Ann goes into labor after the wedding and gives birth to a daughter. Charlie is delighted to have a granddaughter. She is eventually named Martha, after her grandmother. While exploring with his African American friend, Gabriel, Boy is taken prisoner by Yankee soldiers. They don't believe he is not a soldier because of the Confederate cap he is wearing. Gabriel runs back to tell Charlie, who says that now the war concerns them. That night Charlie and his sons, all but James who will stay with Ann, pack up and ride out to visit prison camps in search of Boy. Jennie insists on going with them. They search several camps and hijack a prison train but there is no sign of Boy. However, Jennie is reunited with Sam, who was on board the train. Charlie tells the prisoners they are free. They ask Sam, as the only officer, what they should do. He tells them to go home as the war is lost. That night the family makes camp in a deserted house. Charlie fixes up the bedroom so Jennie and Sam can have their wedding night. The next day they discuss what to do now. Their food supplies are almost gone and the horses need rest. Charlie admits that they are unlikely to find Boy. They start for home and Jacob is shot and killed by a young soldier mistaking them for Yankees. Charlie beats the boy and nearly kills him before he realizes that he is the same age as his missing son. Boy has been in a prison camp but escapes with another prisoner. They travel toward Virginia but are caught up in a battle. Boy's leg is injured and he can't move. To his surprise, Gabriel, now wearing a Yankee uniform, picks him up and carries him to safety. Meanwhile, the Anderson farm was invaded by three men; obviously drifters. They kill James and Ann but do not harm the baby. Dr. Witherspoon, the family physician and a personal friend, discovers the bodies two days later. Having no idea where the rest of the family is, he arranges a nurse for the baby and has James and Ann buried near Martha. The Andersons arrive home and are devastated at the news. Jacob joins his brother and sister-in-law in the family graveyard. It is hard for Charlie to sit down to a table with so many empty chairs. He chokes up and goes to the graveyard, where he once again talks to Martha. He tells her she will like Ann. When the church bells start to ring, Charlie realizes it is Sunday. He orders his surprised family to get ready for church. As usual they are late and the baby is fussy. Then the door opens again and Boy limps in, leaning on a crutch. The congregation begins singing the Doxology as Charlie embraces his son.

                    1933: An ocean liner belonging to a second-rate German company is making a twenty-six day voyage from Veracruz, Mexico to Bremerhaven, Germany. Along the way it will stop in Cuba to pick up a large group of Spanish farm laborers who are being shipped home and who will be housed like cattle in steerage. There it will also pick up La Condesa, a Spanish countess. It will stop in Tenerife, where the farm workers will disembark and where La Condesa will be sent to a German-run prison for her ""traitorous"" activities in Cuba. This voyage will be the last of three for the ship's doctor, Willi Schumann, who has a serious heart ailment and who thought he could find some meaning to his life through this job. Willi and La Condesa fall in love, with the ship's Captain Thiele, who is Willi's closest friend on board, believing the drug-addicted La Condesa is only using him to get her fixes. Willi and La Condesa have to figure out if there is a future for them after the voyage, as Willi's life also includes a wife and sons back in Bremerhaven. Among the other motley crew of passengers are: Mary Treadwell, a middle-aged American divorcée who is trying to recapture her youth; Tenny, a middle-aged American ex-baseball player who laments never having made it big in the game; David and Jenny, a young American couple who say they are in love but who have to overcome their fundamental differences in social standing and life outlooks; Rieber, a middle-aged German Nazi sympathizer who is traveling with a young woman companion and who lords his beliefs over the other German passengers, who in turn are either so self-absorbed with their own lives and/or just don't care to notice what is happening in Germany with the Nazis; and Lowenthal and Glocken, a German Jew and a German dwarf respectively, who are ""paired"" as the outsiders among those in first class. Their encounters, plus those with a rambunctious pair of children, two German teenagers who are coming into their sexual being but are having problems overcoming issues they face, and a troupe of gypsy entertainers whose women are pimped out by their leader, lead to an interesting voyage.

                    It's 1910, and flying has become all the rage, as it, as an activity, is still in its infancy. Despite not being a flying enthusiast himself, Lord Rawnsley, owner of the Daily Post newspaper, organizes a London to Paris flying race in order to boost circulation and show Britain's superiority as he expects who he assumes will eventually be his son-in-law, Richard Mays, will win the race. Richard suggested the race to begin with in order to bring together all the best aviator minds to advance the issue of flying machine design. Richard's unofficial intended, Patricia Rawnsley, is secretly adventurous in nature and wants more than anything to be able to fly, and does whatever she can, against her father's wishes, to be one of those in the air. News of the race goes global, with entries from all over the world. As such, the race does become a competition for national pride and of the most adventurous, as flying more than five miles is still considered an accomplishment, let alone needing to traverse the twenty-two mile distance across the English Channel between Dover and Calais. But it also becomes a competition for Patricia's affections, as one of the entrants is American cowboy Orvil Newton, who is immediately attracted to Patricia and who may be able to give her that flight that she so much wants, which Richard seems unwilling to do as not to get on the wrong side of his future father-in-law.

"39","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058888/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In 1820, young Dr. Yasumoto, returned to Edo after graduating from Dutch medical school in Nagasaki. He presented himself at the public clinic managed by Dr. Niide (Toshiro Mifune), aka Akahige (Red Beard- because of the color of his beard), thinking it was merely a courtesy call arranged by his father (who also a physician).To his surprise and displeasure, he found that out he was expected to work there for a while. Yasumoto didn't find anything to his liking. He found out that the doctors were expected to sacrifice sun (the patients needed the sunny rooms), heat (better for the soul), and tatami (Japanese comfortable bedding). Extremely upset & frustrated because he had hoped to find a prestigious post as a shogun's personal physician, Yasumoto rebelled by not doing what he was supposed to do and refusing to follow the rules. He would not wear the traditional clinic doctor's uniform, refused to eat, drank sake (though it was forbidden) and complained that the patients stank (which one of his colleague at the clinic called ""the smell of poverty""). He reclined on the lawn in front of an isolated ward reserved for a murderous female mental patient (which he had been warned to avoid). In short, he believed he was too good for this under-funded public clinic-that the job and patients were beneath him. His goal was to be asked to leave.One night, the mental patient escaped from her ward. Dr. Niide & nurse Osugi went out looking for her. The escaped patient (nicknamed the Mantis) showed up in Yasumoto's bedroom. She told Yasumoto the story of her life, how men had raped her many times, beginning at age 9. They threatened to kill her if she ever denounced them and she kept quiet. Finally, after a few years, she had had enough of the sexual abuse and snapped-- killing three men (thus the name Mantis). She was quite beautiful and Yasumoto succumbed to her charms. She seduced him, with the intention of killing him. Dr. Niide came back, just in time, to save him. Red Beard excused him for being drunk & for his weakness, as with all other men, because of her beauty and charm. According to Dr. Niide, the Mantis was just born that way.Little by little, Yasumoto started to integrate into the workforce at the clinic. For his 1st assistance in the operating room, he couldn't stand it & fainted. Yasumoto discovered that Dr. Niide, even though he looked stern & appeared difficult, had a kind heart. He managed to get a bit of money to help a patient's destitute daughter with 3 small children (the old man just passed away before her arrival). He gave her 5 ryos (1 gold ryo = USD$150 today). Later he said that he was able to get that money from the magistrate, because he knew the judge had a mistress on the side. Hinting that he might make this information public, Red Beard was able to get the charges against her for attacking her husband dropped. Gradually, Yasumoto started to put on the uniform.When Dr. Niide learned that funds for the clinic were being cut by the government, he was very unhappy. With Yasumoto in tow, he paid a visit to an obese wealthy lord. He ordered a lean diet for the man & charged him 50 ryos, instead of the usual fee of 30. On the way back to the clinic, they paid a visit to a brothel to see a patient with syphilis. There they discovered the madam & her servant were getting a 12 year old girl ready, by way of beating, to receive customers. Dr. Niide had to use force to defeat a dozen thugs working for that madam in order to bring the girl, Otoyo, to the clinic, and begin healing her.He assigned Yasumoto to care for the girl. She was to be his first official patient. Not only was she physically sick (with a fever), she manifested abnormal mental behavior as well (wiping the floor without stopping when she was not feverish, not speaking, and refusing kindnesses). At first Otoyo was resistant, but gradually with Dr. Niide's patience, she started to accept treatment (drinks & medications).Meanwhile, Yasumoto had a visitor named Masae. She was Yasumoto's ex-fiancee's (Chiugas) sister. At first, he refused to see her. But one day, Masae waited for Yasumoto at the gate, hoping to see him. This time he agreed to talk and invited her inside. Seeing Otoyo wearing a torn and weathered kimono, Masae brought her some nice clothes. But Otoyo was not happy with them, because she realized that Masae drew away Yasumoto's attention. In a jealous rage, she threw the new clothes into the mud. She was scolded by the female orderlies. Dr. Niide told them that this was actually a good sign. He could see that Otoyo's love for Yasumoto was her first step in being able to see good in people and overcoming the mistreatment she had experienced. He knew that with time, she would be able to love others as well.One day, while Osugi was having an intimate moment with another doctor at the clinic, the madwoman tried to hang herself. The Mantis' father came & scolded Osugi severely. Dr. Niide came to her defense & reprimanded the father for not caring enough for his daughter, allowing strangers to take advantage of her, causing her illness.One day, a 7 year old beggar boy named Chubo, snuck into the clinic kitchen, trying to steal some gruel. Otoyo befriended him, gave him food, and pleaded with him not to steal anymore. Some time later, the boy came to say goodbye, saying he, his parents, and 2 brothers were leaving for a better place. Otoyo was too young to suspect anything, believing they had some rich relatives who could help them out. Shortly thereafter, the whole family was brought in on the brink of death because they had swallowed rat poison. They were trying to kill themselves because of the disgrace of having a thief in the family (Chubo had been caught stealing again despite Otoyo's pleas). The boy & his parents were saved but his 2 brothers perished.Dr. Niide brought good news to Dr. Yasumoto. Masae's parents proposed that he marry Masae & forgive her sister. Their father, because of the broken engagement, had forbidden Masae's sister to set foot in his house. Now since she had given birth to a baby, he wanted to forgive her in order to be able to see his grandchild. Yasumoto also was promised a post under a shogunate's wing--the job he had always wanted.Yasumoto expressed remorse & regret with Dr. Niide for being haughty & arrogant upon his arrival at the clinic. He expressed regret for questioning Dr. Niide's intentions when Akahige wanted to see his notes. He had learned how to become a real doctor, not only with his knowledge in medicine but how to help others who were much less fortunate than he was - in short, how to be a compassionate doctor.At their wedding ceremony, Yasumoto announced to Masae, in front of their parents & Dr. Niide that he wished to inform her that if she wanted to become his wife, she should be prepared for a life without honor & money because he had decided to continue to work at the clinic of Dr. Niide. Dr. Niide tried to talk him out of it, realizing that it would be a challenging and difficult life--and not for the faint of heart. Yasumoto stuck to his newly learned principles. Akahige was inwardly pleased.","

    In 1820, young Dr. Yasumoto, returned to Edo after graduating from Dutch medical school in Nagasaki. He presented himself at the public clinic managed by Dr. Niide (Toshiro Mifune), aka Akahige (Red Beard- because of the color of his beard), thinking it was merely a courtesy call arranged by his father (who also a physician).To his surprise and displeasure, he found that out he was expected to work there for a while. Yasumoto didn't find anything to his liking. He found out that the doctors were expected to sacrifice sun (the patients needed the sunny rooms), heat (better for the soul), and tatami (Japanese comfortable bedding). Extremely upset & frustrated because he had hoped to find a prestigious post as a shogun's personal physician, Yasumoto rebelled by not doing what he was supposed to do and refusing to follow the rules. He would not wear the traditional clinic doctor's uniform, refused to eat, drank sake (though it was forbidden) and complained that the patients stank (which one of his colleague at the clinic called ""the smell of poverty""). He reclined on the lawn in front of an isolated ward reserved for a murderous female mental patient (which he had been warned to avoid). In short, he believed he was too good for this under-funded public clinic-that the job and patients were beneath him. His goal was to be asked to leave.One night, the mental patient escaped from her ward. Dr. Niide & nurse Osugi went out looking for her. The escaped patient (nicknamed the Mantis) showed up in Yasumoto's bedroom. She told Yasumoto the story of her life, how men had raped her many times, beginning at age 9. They threatened to kill her if she ever denounced them and she kept quiet. Finally, after a few years, she had had enough of the sexual abuse and snapped-- killing three men (thus the name Mantis). She was quite beautiful and Yasumoto succumbed to her charms. She seduced him, with the intention of killing him. Dr. Niide came back, just in time, to save him. Red Beard excused him for being drunk & for his weakness, as with all other men, because of her beauty and charm. According to Dr. Niide, the Mantis was just born that way.Little by little, Yasumoto started to integrate into the workforce at the clinic. For his 1st assistance in the operating room, he couldn't stand it & fainted. Yasumoto discovered that Dr. Niide, even though he looked stern & appeared difficult, had a kind heart. He managed to get a bit of money to help a patient's destitute daughter with 3 small children (the old man just passed away before her arrival). He gave her 5 ryos (1 gold ryo = USD$150 today). Later he said that he was able to get that money from the magistrate, because he knew the judge had a mistress on the side. Hinting that he might make this information public, Red Beard was able to get the charges against her for attacking her husband dropped. Gradually, Yasumoto started to put on the uniform.When Dr. Niide learned that funds for the clinic were being cut by the government, he was very unhappy. With Yasumoto in tow, he paid a visit to an obese wealthy lord. He ordered a lean diet for the man & charged him 50 ryos, instead of the usual fee of 30. On the way back to the clinic, they paid a visit to a brothel to see a patient with syphilis. There they discovered the madam & her servant were getting a 12 year old girl ready, by way of beating, to receive customers. Dr. Niide had to use force to defeat a dozen thugs working for that madam in order to bring the girl, Otoyo, to the clinic, and begin healing her.He assigned Yasumoto to care for the girl. She was to be his first official patient. Not only was she physically sick (with a fever), she manifested abnormal mental behavior as well (wiping the floor without stopping when she was not feverish, not speaking, and refusing kindnesses). At first Otoyo was resistant, but gradually with Dr. Niide's patience, she started to accept treatment (drinks & medications).Meanwhile, Yasumoto had a visitor named Masae. She was Yasumoto's ex-fiancee's (Chiugas) sister. At first, he refused to see her. But one day, Masae waited for Yasumoto at the gate, hoping to see him. This time he agreed to talk and invited her inside. Seeing Otoyo wearing a torn and weathered kimono, Masae brought her some nice clothes. But Otoyo was not happy with them, because she realized that Masae drew away Yasumoto's attention. In a jealous rage, she threw the new clothes into the mud. She was scolded by the female orderlies. Dr. Niide told them that this was actually a good sign. He could see that Otoyo's love for Yasumoto was her first step in being able to see good in people and overcoming the mistreatment she had experienced. He knew that with time, she would be able to love others as well.One day, while Osugi was having an intimate moment with another doctor at the clinic, the madwoman tried to hang herself. The Mantis' father came & scolded Osugi severely. Dr. Niide came to her defense & reprimanded the father for not caring enough for his daughter, allowing strangers to take advantage of her, causing her illness.One day, a 7 year old beggar boy named Chubo, snuck into the clinic kitchen, trying to steal some gruel. Otoyo befriended him, gave him food, and pleaded with him not to steal anymore. Some time later, the boy came to say goodbye, saying he, his parents, and 2 brothers were leaving for a better place. Otoyo was too young to suspect anything, believing they had some rich relatives who could help them out. Shortly thereafter, the whole family was brought in on the brink of death because they had swallowed rat poison. They were trying to kill themselves because of the disgrace of having a thief in the family (Chubo had been caught stealing again despite Otoyo's pleas). The boy & his parents were saved but his 2 brothers perished.Dr. Niide brought good news to Dr. Yasumoto. Masae's parents proposed that he marry Masae & forgive her sister. Their father, because of the broken engagement, had forbidden Masae's sister to set foot in his house. Now since she had given birth to a baby, he wanted to forgive her in order to be able to see his grandchild. Yasumoto also was promised a post under a shogunate's wing--the job he had always wanted.Yasumoto expressed remorse & regret with Dr. Niide for being haughty & arrogant upon his arrival at the clinic. He expressed regret for questioning Dr. Niide's intentions when Akahige wanted to see his notes. He had learned how to become a real doctor, not only with his knowledge in medicine but how to help others who were much less fortunate than he was - in short, how to be a compassionate doctor.At their wedding ceremony, Yasumoto announced to Masae, in front of their parents & Dr. Niide that he wished to inform her that if she wanted to become his wife, she should be prepared for a life without honor & money because he had decided to continue to work at the clinic of Dr. Niide. Dr. Niide tried to talk him out of it, realizing that it would be a challenging and difficult life--and not for the faint of heart. Yasumoto stuck to his newly learned principles. Akahige was inwardly pleased.

                    Twenty-something Laura Reynolds is a free spirit who questions social conventions, laws and regulations. A struggling artist, she lives in a secluded beach-side cabin in Big Sur with her nine year old illegitimate son, Danny, on who she has instilled her values. Because of this questioning of convention, Laura has decided to home school Danny. Also because of this questioning of the law, Danny runs into some legal problems, and as such is court ordered to be sent to San Simeon, a Christian school in Monterey. This order is against Laura's wishes. The school's headmaster is Dr. Rev. Edward Hewitt, who tries to convince Laura that San Simeon is not the prison she probably believes it to be. Married for twenty-one years to his faithful wife Claire, Edward has become more a fund-raiser at all cost (for a new chapel) rather than an educator or priest. Despite their differences, Laura and Edward begin to fall for each other. Both but especially Edward have to reconcile their feelings for each other to their beliefs, which they learn are closer to each other than what may appear on the surface. Their feelings also bring to the forefront what each really wants in life beyond their current lot.

Roderigo and Iago maliciously bait Brabantio, an old senator, with the news that his daughter Desdemona is betrothed to Othello. Before Council Chamber, Brabentio accused Othello of abducting his daughter. The Moor denies this, and Desdemona affirms loyalty to her husband. Othello is ordered to defend Cyprus, of which he is Governor, against the Turks. Iago assures Roderigo, who is secretly in love with Desdemona, that she will not love Othello for long. Iago brings Desdemona to Cyprus to celebrate Othello's victory against the Turks and incites Cassio and Montano into a drunken brawl. Montano is seriously hurt and Iago beckons Othello, blaming Cassio, who is dismissed from duties. Iago then advises Cassio to seek Desdemona's assistance in regaining Othello's favor. Iago arranges Othello to find his wife in earnest conversation with Cassio, and subtly arouses the Moor's jealousy with creating a slanderous piece of evidence by placing Desdemona's handkerchief in the possession of Cassio.

They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration.The opening credits feature the image of ""an immobile young woman clad in gold"". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff. The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his ""Princess of the Night"", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night's entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery. The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the woman dances, Bob and Shirley make their way to the cemetery and start observing the dance from a distance. Shirley suspects that they are observing a college initiation, though Bob seriously doubts her theory.The Emperor himself summons the third dancer, a woman who worshiped gold above else. The Golden Girl (Pat Barrington) dances in her turn, and the Emperor instructs his loin-clothed servants to reward her with gold. The supposed reward is soon revealed to be a punishment, as the servants place her in a cauldron with liquid gold. What emerges from the cauldron is a golden statue of the living woman who entered. The servants transport the immobile statue to a nearby crypt.At this point, a werewolf (John Andrews) and mummy (Louis Ojena) appear and seize the intruding young couple. They are brought before the Emperor who decides to postpone deciding their fate. The intruders are tied up, side by side, and allowed to continue watching the dances. The Black Ghoul next introduces the fourth dancer, a ""Cat Woman"" (Texas Starr). She is depicted as a woman dressed in a leopard costume, which exposes her chest area. As she dances, a servant follows her around and thrashes her with a bullwhip. Offering a sadomasochistic show for the spectators.The Emperor next calls for a Slave Girl (Nadejda Dobrev) to be whipped for his amusement. The slave wears a tunic and is chained to a wall. Following her torture session, the Slave Girl breaks free and becomes the fifth dancer of the night. Later, the Black Ghoul exhibits a fascination with Shirley and scratches a mark on her. She draws a knife and seems about to kill Shirley, when the Emperor decides it is not yet time for the intruders to properly join them. The female ghoul reluctantly obeys.The Emperor is puzzled when a human skull appears instead of the next dancer. The Black Ghoul explains it is the symbol of the sixth dancer, who loved bullfighting and matadors. She used to dance over their demise, and now it's time to dance over her own. The dancer of apparent Spanish/Mexican heritage (Stephanie Jones) appears to perform. The Emperor and Ghoul briefly discuss the past of the dancer, who came to them on the Day of the Dead.The seventh dancer appears dressed in Polynesian garments. The Black Ghoul describes her as a worshiper of snakes, smoke, and flames. A rattlesnake is depicted along with her dance. The camera shifts to the mummy and the werewolf. The mummy voices his dislike of snakes and recalls the death of Cleopatra. He informs his companion that ancient Egypt had many snakes and they were the stuff of nightmares.The Emperor next expresses his boredom and demands ""unusual"" entertainment, while the Black Ghoul notes that the night is almost over. She reminds her superior that they will be gone at the first sight of the morning sun. They proceed to argue over the fate of Shirley.The argument ends with the introduction of the eighth dancer (Barbara Nordin), a woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night. She dances with the skeleton of her spouse. The argument over Shirley then resumes, as the Ghoul claims her for her own. The Emperor feels the need to assert his own authority over the Black Ghoul.The ninth dancer (Dene Starnes) was a zombie in life and remains zombie-like in death. The tenth and final dancer (Rene De Beau) is introduced as one who died for feathers, fur, and fluff. She starts her dance in clothing matching this style. When the final dance ends, the Emperor finally offers Shirley to the Ghoul. The Ghoul briefly dances herself as she prepares to claim her prize. But dawn arrives and with it sunlight. The Emperor and all his undead are reduced to bones.The final scene has Bob and Shirley waking up at the scene of the accident, surrounded by paramedics, suggesting it was all a dream. Criswell appears in his coffin to offer parting words to the audience.","
    
                    John and his girlfriend Shirley go in search of a cemetary in order to inspire John for writing his next horror story. After they crash the car, they wander into the graveyard and encounter the dancing dead, a full moon spectacle overseen by the Ruler of the Dark. Before long the couple is spotted and taken prisoner.

    Synopsis
    The film opens to two muscle-bound men dressed in loincloths approaching a crypt. They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration.The opening credits feature the image of ""an immobile young woman clad in gold"". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff. The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his ""Princess of the Night"", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night's entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery. The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the woman dances, Bob and Shirley make their way to the cemetery and start observing the dance from a distance. Shirley suspects that they are observing a college initiation, though Bob seriously doubts her theory.The Emperor himself summons the third dancer, a woman who worshiped gold above else. The Golden Girl (Pat Barrington) dances in her turn, and the Emperor instructs his loin-clothed servants to reward her with gold. The supposed reward is soon revealed to be a punishment, as the servants place her in a cauldron with liquid gold. What emerges from the cauldron is a golden statue of the living woman who entered. The servants transport the immobile statue to a nearby crypt.At this point, a werewolf (John Andrews) and mummy (Louis Ojena) appear and seize the intruding young couple. They are brought before the Emperor who decides to postpone deciding their fate. The intruders are tied up, side by side, and allowed to continue watching the dances. The Black Ghoul next introduces the fourth dancer, a ""Cat Woman"" (Texas Starr). She is depicted as a woman dressed in a leopard costume, which exposes her chest area. As she dances, a servant follows her around and thrashes her with a bullwhip. Offering a sadomasochistic show for the spectators.The Emperor next calls for a Slave Girl (Nadejda Dobrev) to be whipped for his amusement. The slave wears a tunic and is chained to a wall. Following her torture session, the Slave Girl breaks free and becomes the fifth dancer of the night. Later, the Black Ghoul exhibits a fascination with Shirley and scratches a mark on her. She draws a knife and seems about to kill Shirley, when the Emperor decides it is not yet time for the intruders to properly join them. The female ghoul reluctantly obeys.The Emperor is puzzled when a human skull appears instead of the next dancer. The Black Ghoul explains it is the symbol of the sixth dancer, who loved bullfighting and matadors. She used to dance over their demise, and now it's time to dance over her own. The dancer of apparent Spanish/Mexican heritage (Stephanie Jones) appears to perform. The Emperor and Ghoul briefly discuss the past of the dancer, who came to them on the Day of the Dead.The seventh dancer appears dressed in Polynesian garments. The Black Ghoul describes her as a worshiper of snakes, smoke, and flames. A rattlesnake is depicted along with her dance. The camera shifts to the mummy and the werewolf. The mummy voices his dislike of snakes and recalls the death of Cleopatra. He informs his companion that ancient Egypt had many snakes and they were the stuff of nightmares.
The Emperor next expresses his boredom and demands ""unusual"" entertainment, while the Black Ghoul notes that the night is almost over. She reminds her superior that they will be gone at the first sight of the morning sun. They proceed to argue over the fate of Shirley.The argument ends with the introduction of the eighth dancer (Barbara Nordin), a woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night. She dances with the skeleton of her spouse. The argument over Shirley then resumes, as the Ghoul claims her for her own. The Emperor feels the need to assert his own authority over the Black Ghoul.The ninth dancer (Dene Starnes) was a zombie in life and remains zombie-like in death. The tenth and final dancer (Rene De Beau) is introduced as one who died for feathers, fur, and fluff. She starts her dance in clothing matching this style. When the final dance ends, the Emperor finally offers Shirley to the Ghoul. The Ghoul briefly dances herself as she prepares to claim her prize. But dawn arrives and with it sunlight. The Emperor and all his undead are reduced to bones.The final scene has Bob and Shirley waking up at the scene of the accident, surrounded by paramedics, suggesting it was all a dream. Criswell appears in his coffin to offer parting words to the audience.

The United Nations Economic, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has agreed to finance the project, the brainchild of Dr. Stephen Sorensen (Dana Andrews), after he has promised unlimited geothermal energy for an energy-hungry world.Dr. Sorensen's wife, Maggie (Janette Scott), guides a convoy of senior UNESCO officials, led by Sir Charles Eggerston (Alexander Knox), to the Project site. Sir Charles orders the convoy to stop as it passes the Project's bore hole complex. He has spotted the real reason for his trip: a ballistic missile, minus its warhead, hanging nozzle-up from a crane, directly over the bore hole. Frostily he demands that Maggie explain the missile; she confidently reminds him that it is not armed, and that he and his fellow Science Councillors are there to decide whether to allow the arming or not.Maggie leads Sir Charles and the others to the main building, built over a two-mile-deep shaft. There they ride an elevator (called a ""lift"" here) two miles down to the Central Operations complex: essentially a bunker where the real work of Project Inner Space takes place. There, Sorensen waits for the Council--but also is taking an X-ray treatment to a malignant growth (probably malignant melanoma, though this is never made clear) in his hand. His doctor, Bill Evans (Alfred Brown), knows that the treatments will not work, but, out of respect for the doctor-patient confidence that is basic to the Oath of Hippocrates, agrees to keep Sorensen's illness, and its severity, secret from everyone. That includes his wife, who is young enough to have been his daughter. (In fact, Maggie was once a student of his; that's how they met.)Sorensen cordially greets the Council and readily acknowledges a problem that Sir Charles challenged Maggie with on their way down: namely that Sorensen's drilling team has hit a solid wall that is all that separates them from the magma, and that in 17 weeks he hasn't advanced an inch. So now Sorensen wants to blast his way in with a thermonuclear missile (a gift from the United States). Sir Charles asks why the project's chief geologist, Ted Rampian (Kieron Moore), is not present. Rampian is a dissenting voice: he has warned that using a thermonuclear warhead as a demolition charge will deliver such a shock to the earth that the crust will crack. Sorensen gives a dismissive demonstration of Rampian's theory, and then delivers the majority opinion: that the detonation will release great heat and merely melt through to the magma.Sir Charles and the rest of the UNESCO Council are satisfied. But Ted Rampian returns, and is outraged to see the missile not only hanging in place, but now equipped with its warhead! Finding out that the UNESCO Council has already been and gone, without hearing from him, doesn't improve his mood. He angrily resigns from the Project and prepares to take all his notes and charts with him to London to lay his case before Sir Charles directly. Maggie begs him not to go, but she cannot stop him. (As a complication, Ted and Maggie were ""an item"" before she enrolled in Sorensen's class. Ted is still jealous, and they both know it. Perhaps even Steve knows it.)Rampian does get in to see Sir Charles and set forth his case in detail: years of nuclear testing (before the test ban treaty) have created ""fissures"" in the crust, several of them leading to a major tectonic fault. A thermonuclear detonation at that depth will crack them open, and if the crack extended along the fault, who knows where it might lead? Sir Charles frantically puts a call through to the Project. But they are too late. Sorensen orders the missile shot to proceed, desperate to achieve success before his funding gets cut and he dies before he can see his work done. The missile takes a dive, the warhead detonates, and magma shoots up to the surface, exactly as Sorensen said it would. Sorensen, generous in victory, asks Sir Charles to tell Rampian to get himself back to the Project and get back to work!Rampian returns to a Project in a triumphant mood. But then the earthquake reports start to trickle in. Rampian realizes that they are right along the fault, as he feared. Hastily he organizes a dive in the Indian Ocean, and there photographs what he was afraid to find: a chasm with magma boiling out of it, extending at three knots along the floor of the Indian Ocean. He brings his photographs back to Sorensen, who acknowledges the horrible truth: he has cracked the earth's crust, and might have started something that could destroy the world.The UNESCO Councillors are outraged, of course, but Sir Charles tells his colleagues, quite reasonably, to let Drs. Sorensen and Rampian work out a way to solve the problem. Rampian returns to the Project and assumes command. He and Sorensen then pore over spectrographic data and films of old nuclear detonations, and finally realize what has happened: the missile touched off a fusion explosion in a layer of hydrogen in a pocket beneath the magma, so that the force of the explosion was greater than Sorensen expected. But this finding also suggests a solution: another detonation in the path of the crack could break a gaping hole in the crust; the crack would run into it and stop. Rampian sets out with a heat-shielded fission bomb and asks a fellow scientist, Steele (Mike Steen), to descend into a dormant volcano crater with him to drop the bomb into the lava. Steele dies when the bomb, catching Steele's line between itself and the surrounding rock, parts the cable and sends Steele falling into the lava pit. Rampian, nearly overcome with grief, barely manages to release the bomb into the lava before he collapses at his line, overcome by the heat. The crew hastily haul him up and take him off the island, to a nearby island where they give the signal to set the bomb off. The bomb blows the volcano cone away, and at the Project site, the seismologists confidently believe that the crack has in fact stopped.Then Dr. Evans sends a message to Maggie informing her of the truth about her husband: that his disease is malignant, terminal, and will kill him within a week. She takes a tearful leave of Ted and prepares to rush back to Sorensen's side. But then another earthquake in the Indian Ocean signals that the crack has not stopped, but has changed direction. Rampian asks Sorensen to be more specific, and when he hears where the new quake's epicenter was, he realizes that the crack has doubled back toward the Project's original bore hole--a course that might not have the dire consequences of cleaving the crust into two equal hemispheres. But the crack is now moving at twice its original speed.Rampian rushes back to South Africa to observe the crack's progress personally. He and Maggie soon realize that two cracks have opened in the crust, both converging on the bore hole. Rampian orders an evacuation of a nearby village--but can then only watch helplessly as an evacuation train heads directly for the crack, and is wrecked when the crack knocks over a trestle while the train is trying to cross it. Frustrated, Rampian orders another evacuation, and then he and Maggie return to the Project. There they find that Sorensen has ordered a full evacuation--but Sorensen has stayed below in the bunker and won't come up!Maggie and Rampian take the elevator down, to find Sorensen sitting alone at the consoles. He says that he will personally record what he believes will be the birth of a new moon. Of course, he really is suicidal, a fact he makes clear when he sends Rampian and Maggie out of the control room on separate errands--and then abruptly shuts the heavy door, locking himself in, and then shorts out the motors that move the door. Heartsick, Rampian and Maggie race for the elevator to take it topside--but then a boulder smashes into the elevator cab, stopping it about halfway up. Desperately the two climb through the trap door and up the elevator shaft, and then climb uphill away from the bore hole as fast as they can.Finally the two cracks meet at the bore hole, and a gigantic disk of crust lifts up into space, to join the Moon in orbit. After which the earthquake activity stops, and small animals come out of hiding as Rampian and Maggie comfort one another, happy to be alive in a world that can still sustain them.","
    
                    Dr. Stephen Sorenson plans to tap the geothermal energy of the Earth's interior by means of a thermonuclear device detonated deep within the earth.

She find a kind of alien flower. Barbara screams at the small statue of a crocrodile. On the mayhem, Ian falls onto the thing and breaks it.Susan find the lights of empty buildings. Barbara starts thinking that something terrible happened in that place, and that it's dangerous. Ian tells Dr. Who that he's expected at home, so that they must return. Finally, who obliges. Susan gets lost because she finds another of those beautiful flowers. She runs away because a hand has touched her, but nobody seems to believe her.Back at the phone booth, they cannot see anyone with their surveillance cameras, but Susy insists that she was touched on the shoulder. There are knocks on the door, which startle Ian, but there isn't anybody around. They try to leave, but can't, and when they step aside, Susan courageously picks up a small blue container - it's has four small tubes with a liquid inside.They go to the city, which looks empty. Dr. Who gets tired easily. They enter an empty home with different rooms. Ian's door is the only one which doesn't open automatically, as he needs to touch something. Barbara walks a long corridor, and it looks as though she's being watched. She ends up being trapped and screams. Susan sits on the spot to open up the door. Susy, Ian and Who follow a noise to a communication room. Dr. Who looks tired. When they turn around, the three of them find themselves surrounded by Daleks. Ian is left dizzy by the Daleks, who also took the object which they found. They reunite with Barbara in a room/cell.Temmosus (Geoffrey Toone), Antodus (John Bown), Dyoni (Yvonne Antrobus) and Elyon (Mark Petersen). Some of them believe the letter offering to be their friends - supposedly written by Susan. Who devises a plan to escape using Susan's cape as an insulator. At that moment, a Dalek appears to bring them food, they put food in their periscope and attack it by blinding its eye with the disgusting food. Ian gets into the blue Dalek. There is also the image of a kind of green claw, a proof of the mutations which have taken place in the . Susan leads the way, and pretends to be the blue Dale's prisoner. They are soon found out anyway, so they have to break the lift, but the blue Dalek with Ian inside can't get into it. Now we realise that finally, Ian unstuck the head and was able to leave it in time.The four humans arrive in time to tell the Thals that they cannot hide in the forst forever. In fact, the Daleks are planning to bomb all the planet. However, the Thals have become peaceful, too peaceful. It was war which destroyed the planet and caused all the destruction and polution in Skaro. The Thals insist, and even the death of one of them was not convincing. Dr. Who tells Ian to take Dyoni to the Daleks. The leader won't allow it, so that settles the matter: they will have to fightSusan and Ian with cross a mutant-infested swamp with some Thals. On their way, they find the tubes which are polluting the water. Elyon stays behind to take some samples of the water, when he is eaten by something from the river.The Daleks are reuniting: they want to destroy the Thals forever. The other four follow the pipes to some caves. There is a fight between the two remaining Thals, because one of them wants to go back and forget the city.Who was supposed te watch some cakes, but they get burnt, to Susan's disappointment. Two female ladies are looking at themselves in the mirror, which gives Who an idea. Ian has to jump over a cliff, which he does, but then one of the Thals seems to have second thoughts over the whole ordeal. With plenty of mirrors, Who and the thals will make the detectors useless. The Daleks start to move on. Dr Who and Susan are captured again. The Daleks start the countdown for the bomb. Finally, one of the Daleks decides that they must fight. Dr. Who offers his time machine if the Daleks don't explode the bomb, but the Daleks will figure it out how it works after having exploded the bomb. Susan, Ian and the two Thals enter the Dalek's castle and run away using another lift. Finally, the rest of the Daleks fight. They reach control room. Two Daleks destroy one another. The Daleks destroy the computer when trying to kill Ian. All the Daleks are dead - three seconds left, which Ian alleges it's his lucky number.Why fills up the energy of the time machine. The Thals appreciate what they have done for them. They give Ian the purple coat - which Ian uses. Ian panics because they appear in the middle of a battle during the Roman Empire. They leave immediately.

Selina has never attended school and on Rose-Ann's direction lives as a shut-in, only cleaning the apartment and cooking, the dinner which has to be on the table by the time Rose-Ann gets home or else. The only other thing Selina does is string beads for Mr. Faber to supplement what little income comes into their household. Ole Pa and Rose-Ann are always griping at each other with Ole Pa only helping Selina when he knows it irks Rose-Ann. Rose-Ann is abusive toward Selina, who has no reason to doubt whatever abuse is thrown her way from her mother is not the truth, especially the implications that she is not pretty. As such, Selina doesn't even really know that she has a miserable life because of her family. One day, Mr. Faber takes Selina to the park, which starts to open her eyes to life outside the apartment. As such, she is able to convince Ole Pa routinely to take her to the park first thing in the morning, the park where she will string more beads than she has ever done in one day, with him picking her up on his way home after work. It is on that first trip to the park that Selina meets Gordon Ralfe, an educated young man who slowly learns of Selina's situation. The more Gordon learns about Selina, the more he wants to help her become more self-sufficient and independent. The issue that he and most of the world can see but that she can't is that he is a black man, that assistance which many would construe as him trying to take advantage purely because he's black. Gordon has no ulterior motives beyond being Selina's friend and wanting her to have a good life. But he also knows that problems can and will ensue due to public scrutiny, and even more so if Rose-Ann or Ole Pa find out about him. The situation gets even more complicated as Selina falls in love with him, she perhaps not knowing the difference between romantic love and other types of human connection. Gordon's choice of what to do may be easier for him to decide but no less difficult to achieve if he knew that Rose-Ann, based on her prostitute friend Sadie's scheme, believes that Selina is now old enough to get into the business herself to add even more income to Rose-Ann's pocket.

                    The story of a chance encounter beneath a tree in a city park and the friendship that ensues. Accidentally blinded by her mother when she was five, Selina knows very little of the world beyond the dirty walls of her grandfather's tenement apartment. Enduring a life of servitude to her prostitute mother, Roseanne, and ""Ole' Pa,"" her drunkard grandfather, Selina spends her days cleaning the apartment, washing and ironing her mother's and grandfather's clothes, and preparing their supper. Her only companionship is the radio until Mr. Faber (for whom she strings beads to bring in money) one day offers to take her to the park. ""The sky's blue, ain't it?"" she asks. ""I remember blue."" When she meets Gordon who becomes her only friend, the park is quickly transformed into the center of her universe. Knowing Gordon only as the kind and caring person that he is, Selina's feelings for him deepen. Only after Roseanne catches sight of Gordon escorting her daughter back to the apartment, one day, does Selina discover that Gordon is black. Her blindness has given Selina perspective which is sorely lacking in Roseanne and Ole Pa. To get her away from Gordon, Roseanne makes plans to move into an apartment with her friend Sadie. They will start their own ""business"" where Selina might provide yet another source of income. How will Selina escape the future that Roseanne has planned for her? Will she ever see Gordon again?

As the storm rages, a car full of drunken teenagers has crashed into the landslide. Throwing open the doors, the music from the car radio blares out the doors as they dance and drink beer in the rain. After some time, one of them notices a broken sign telling that Hainesville is 3 miles away. One of them suggests to go there to have some fun.In town, teenage couple Mike (Tommy Kirk) and Nancy (Charla Doherty) are having an intimate moment when Nancy's little brother Genius (Ron Howard) interrupts them, showing a concoction that he has made with non-compatible chemicals. Strange enough, the mixture has not blown up. Nancy professes to not being impressed, and Genius returns to his basement laboratory, where he puts an electrical charge to the concoction, resulting in an explosion.Mike and Nancy quickly enter the lab, and find the concoction has turned pinkish, growing out of a tulip glass that Genius put it in. As they attempt to clean up the basement, a stray cat enters the lab and begins to eat some of the concoction. Mike shoos the cat away, but soon, the three find that the cat has grown enormous! Genius' dog named Wolf chases the cat out of the house, before Mike wonders what they have on their hands. Genius explains the concoction is probably ""Ammonia-actride-sulfate-deethyl-chlorazine,"" but opts to just call it ""goo.""Mike takes some, and the three go outside. Feeding it to a pair of white ducks, they watch as the ducks grow large, with Mike deciding that they can easily make a million dollars from Genius' invention. After going back inside, they find that Wolf has also eaten some of the goo, and grown large. The amusement soon turns to shock when Nancy looks out the window and sees the giant ducks are gone.Meanwhile, the delinquent teens have broken into the closed Hainesville theater. Having cleaned up, they head off to the local go-go dance club. No sooner have they arrived, than the giant ducks appear, amusing everyone as they dance to the music. Mike and Nancy are not far behind, and when Mike claims the ducks are his, one of the delinquent teens named Harry (Robert Random) demands to know how they got so big. Mike just hints that it's a food additive, and a 'million dollar secret.'Harry tells the other delinquents, who formulate a plan to try and find out more about the food additive. The leader of the delinquents named Fred (Beau Bridges) attempts to woo Nancy, while one of the girls named Jean (Tisha Sterling) attempts to get the information from Mike. However, neither Mike nor Nancy divulge the information Fred or Jean ask for.The next day, the giant ducks are killed and barbecued at a party in a nearby park. As Mike and Nancy serve up the giant ducks, Genius arrives, intent to show them that he's made more goo...only to watch as the substance dissolves into nothingness. One of the delinquent teen girls named Elsa (Gail Gilmore) notices this, and persuades Genius to take a walk with her, as she hopes he'll tell her where the rest of the goo is.Later on that evening, the delinquents sneak over to Nancy's house, and one of the teens named Pete (Tim Rooney) sneaks in and steals the substance, but not before a burglar alarm is tripped. Mike and his friends show up, and a brawl ensues, but the delinquents get away with the goo.Returning to the town theater, some of the teenagers want to use the goo and get rich, when a couple of the guys dare the others to take it. Several refuse to be considered cowards, and everyone takes the goo, causing the teenagers to grow 30 ft tall, and bursting out of their clothes. Some of the girls are ashamed of their size, but some of the guys see this as a way to get back at the adults.Fashioning clothing from curtains and cloth in the theater, the giants leave and appear at the local teen party, and proceed to dance. One of the girls named Merrie (Joy Harmon) picks up Mike friend Horsey (Johnny Crawford), and holds him to her chest as if he were dancing with her. Mike demands Fred tell Merrie to put his friend down, but when Fred refuses, Mike breaks a wooden chair on Fred's lower leg, causing the dancing to end.After brushing Mike aside Fred asserts that they are going to take over the town, but his plans fall short when the local Sheriff (Joe Turkel) arrives, and orders the giants to return to the theater where they've been staying.The Sheriff and Mike show up at the theater the next day, with the Sheriff demanding the giant teenagers leave Hainesville. However, Rick reveals that they have kidnapped the Sheriff's daughter, and use her as leverage against the Sheriff. The Sheriff then gives into the giants demands and surrenders all the guns in the town to them, as well as has food brought to them.Mike decides to do something about this, and feels that they need to capture one of the giants as their own hostage. Luring Fred into a neighborhood, Mike, Horsey and their friends attempt to capture Fred using their cars and some rope. However, the plan backfires when Pete captures Nancy, and Mike and the others are forced to let Fred go, as the two giants take her to the theater.Mike then comes up with a new scheme, with Horsey's girlfriend Red (Toni Basil) sent in to distract the male giants with a dance. After this, Mike appears outside the theater with a slingshot, meant as a distraction. Fred goes after Mike with a spear, and sends Merrie back into the theater to watch Nancy and the Sheriff's daughter. While she watches, Horsey shocks her with a large amount of ether-filled cotton, causing her to pass out. This allows Horsey and his friends to free Nancy and the Sheriff's daughter, and recover the guns.Meanwhile, Genius has failed to make more goo, but has come up with a yellow gaseous antidote that proves itself when Wolf shrinks back to normal size.Genius quickly takes the antidote and heads to the town square, where he uses it on the giants, shrinking them back down to normal size. Clutching onto their oversized garments, the now shrunken teens run out of town back to their car at the landslide. Realizing the car is damaged beyond repair, they realize they have a long walk ahead of them.Before they start, they are greeted by several little people who claim they are heading to Hainesville to find out about the goo. After the little people have passed them, the once giant teenagers walk off away from the small village and their car.","
    
                    Mike thinks he's hit the jackpot when his girlfriend Nancy's kid brother, who they call Genius, creates a growth compound that results in animals growing to huge proportions.

While Genius tries to recreate the experiment to make more goo, Fred and his gang try to steal the existing goo. When Fred and his gang get their hands on it, they, on peer pressure, instead do something which leads to them thinking they can change the world to their way of thinking. Mike has to figure out a way to restore order in the town from Fred and his growing gang.

They soon change their minds and decide to eat the goo themselves and grow to gigantic proportions and decide to take over the town. They then kidnap the sheriff's daughter and later Nancy as insurance to make sure that they get what they want.

Once she hits the water, we learn the sky diver was Bonnie (Deborah Walley), one of the instructors from a sky diving school, who trades places with Sugar (i.e., it was a fake skydive set up by Sugar's agent, Bullets (Paul Lynde), as a publicity stunt for her album). The surfer dudes paddle out on their boards to rescue Sugar. Frankie is credited with the rescue.Meanwhile, Eric von Zipper (Harvey Lembeck) and his Malibu Rat Pack motorcycle gang show up looking for Sugar. Eric is madly in love with her; he is there to rescue her from what he perceives to be trouble with the surfer dudes.In the next scene, Donna Loren sings ""It Only Hurts When I Cry."" She is roasting a wiener in a house fireplace while she sings. (It appears these teenagers are living together. If it is a beach cottage, who is staying there? Just the girls? No one ever goes home. If it is a dorm, no one goes to class.)While Frankie and Dee Dee walk on the beach, they talk about skydiving; Frankie wants to try it. So does Dee Dee, but Frankie chauvinistically just wants her to watch him.The next day, the whole gang, minus Bonehead (Jody McCrea), goes to the Big Drop Skydiving School. Big Drop (Don Rickles) introduces them to their instructors, Bonnie and Steve (John Ashley). According to Steve, the best way to learn is to watch, so he and Bonnie demonstrate.Meanwhile back at the beach, Bonehead paddles out on his surfboard, falls off and almost drowns. He is saved by a mermaid who deposits him in the surf near the shore. Sugar happens by and rushes to help the semi-unconscious Bonehead. Her agent shows up just in time to claim Sugar saved Bonehead and to take a picture with his Polaroid camera. He invites Bonehead and his entire gang of surfers to dinner the following evening at Sugar's.Eric von Zipper and South Dakota Slim (Timothy Carey; his film name is a takeoff on the famous pool player Minnesota Fats) are playing pool. One of Zipper's Rats, J.D. (Andy Romano) brings him a newspaper with the headline, ""Skydiving Singer Saves Surfer,"" which also has the photo Bullets had taken. Zipper orders his motorcycle gang to rescue Sugar from the surfers. He and his Rat Pack perform a silly little ditty titled ""Follow Your Leader.""At Sugar's the next evening, Bullets introduces Sugar to perform a song (""New Love"") from her new album, ""Come Fall With Me"" (a takeoff on the title of Frank Sinatra's ""Come Fly With Me"" LP). Dee Dee is jealous of Frankie's attention to Sugar. Instead of going to the party at Sugar's,Meanwhile, Bonehead is out on his surfboard looking for the mermaid who rescued him. When he finds her, he learns her name is Lorelei (Marta Kristen). He asks her to come ashore so he can introduce her to his friends, but she can't. She does agree to meet him again the same time the following evening.Dee Dee and Frankie walk on the beach again and sing the duet, ""I Think You Think."" At the end of the song, they kiss. The next day at the Skydiving School, Bonnie gets very friendly with Frankie, which makes Steve and Dee Dee jealous.The gang finds Bonehead at the beach in a trance thinking about Lorelei. Frankie brings Sugar to try to get him out of his trance and it works. She agrees to go with him to the dance at the Pavilion that evening.At the dance, Bullets arranges for Sugar to sing. Big Drop introduces gossip columnist, Earl Wilson (himself), who is in the audience and then performs a nightclub-type act where he insults everybody (the type of comedy for which Don Rickles is famous). Then he introduces Sugar, who, accompanied by the surf rock band, the Hondells (themselves), performs ""Fly Boy."" To Bullets' consternation, all the kids dance while she sings (he thinks they are taking attention away from his client). At Bonnie's urging, Steve cuts in to dance with Dee Dee, so she can dance with Frankie. When Bonehead and Sugar go for a walk on the beach, he keeps hearing the mermaid's song. When they wander into the surf, something bites Sugar's ankle (the mermaid). Bonehead suddenly remembers his date with Lorelei and rushes away leaving Sugar alone on the beach.Back at the party, Big Drop introduces Frankie to sing ""These Are the Good Times."" Bonnie drools over him, which makes Steve furious. After his song, even though Bonnie objects, Steve tells Frankie that tomorrow will be his first jump. Despite Dee Dee's protestations, his jump goes smoothly.When Bonehead finds Lorelei, she appears in a bikini that she made from some scraps she had found in the ocean. She tells him she has never met a human she likes in all of her three-hundred years of life. He finally convinces her to go out with him, but she makes him promise not to tell his friends that she's a mermaid. He promises and agrees to purchase whatever clothing she needs.Dee Dee sings ""I'll Never Change Him"" during a time in the film when she is jealous about Frankie's attentions towards Sugar, but that scene is cut from some video editions. She sings from her bedroom in the cottage/dorm. At the end, she collapses on her bed.The next morning, it is Dee Dee's turn to skydive. Frankie does his best to talk her out of it, but she is determined. Bonnie is the pilot and Frankie tags along. After Dee Dee jumps, Bonnie puts the plane on autopilot and makes a pass at Frankie. When he refuses her advances, she tears her blouse and, once they land, accuses Frankie of trying to take advantage of her. Steve doesn't believe Bonnie until Frankie intervenes in the argument to tell Steve that Bonnie is only trying to make him jealous and that the two of them must stop their games of trying to put each other down.That evening, Lorelei dresses behind a rock at the beach in the clothes that Bonehead had purchased for her. They go to a dance where the Hondells play ""Cycle Set."" Lorelei can't dance to something so fast, so Bonehead, who is dressed in a suit and tie, requests a slow number. Bullets and Earl Wilson are surprised to see the surfers and their dates dancing to something so slow.Suddenly, Eric von Zipper rides his motorcycle through the wall ending up in an aquarium. Since Sugar isn't there, they go to her place to kidnap her. She is so dense she thinks the kidnapping is another publicity stunt cooked up by her agent.Lorelei must be back in the water before midnight, so she and Bonehead leave the dance. While she is changing back into a mermaid, she tells Bonehead that she loves him, but they don't belong together. She disappears back into the sea.When Bullets finds Bonehead alone, he thinks Bonehead has drowned Sugar. Frankie and the gang show up just in time to convince Bullets not to call the police. They promise Sugar will be on the beach the next day. Bonehead hears the mermaid song again, so he leaves to find her. He finds her bikini on the beach and next to it, written in the sand, the words ""von Zipper.""He now knows where Sugar is, so he finds her with Zipper. Bonehead knocks Zipper out, but South Dakota Slim knocks him out and takes Sugar with two of the motorcycle Mice.Meanwhile, Dee Dee and Frankie are skydiving together. When they jump, their chutes don't open soon enough, so they end up in the ocean. Steve crashes his plane in the ocean to save Dee Dee. Lorelei shows up to help Frankie and gives him a medallion necklace to return to Bonehead. Then the surfers attack von Zipper and the Rat Pack at their pool hall looking for Sugar. They find out that South Dakota Slim has abducted her. What follows is a silly climatic chase scene involving the Rat Pack on their motorcycles and the surfers in their convertibles as part of homage to slapstick silent films.South Dakota Slim has Sugar tied to a log in a saw mill; he is reenacting one of his favorite movie scenes from ""The Perils of Pauline."" He stops the log just before it reaches the saw. Two of the girls from von Zippers' Malibu Rats try to help her when Slim isn't looking. Frankie and Bonehead come crashing through the window of the sawmill to save Sugar; she gives Bonehead all the credit. Frankie gives Bonehead the necklace Lorelei had given him, which he puts around Sugar's neck. However, Von Zipper ends up getting cartoonishly cut in half by a large buzz saw.Later that evening at the beach, Dee Dee asks Frankie if there really was a mermaid. He answers, ""Is there a moon? Is there a sky? Are there dreams?"" They kiss as the audience sees a mermaid's tail disappear into the ocean. The word ""Fin-ee"" flashes on the screen to conclude the film.Like the opening, Dee Dee, Frankie and the gang sing ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" during the final credits.","

                    Set in German-occupied Norway, this is an embellished account of the remarkable efforts of the Norwegian resistance to sabotage the German development of the atomic bomb. Resistance fighter Knut Straud enlists the reluctant physicist Rolf Pedersen in an effort to destroy the German heavy water production plant near the village of Rjukan in rural Telemark. In the process, Pedersen discovers that his ex-wife Anna and her uncle have also joined the resistance. British commandos dispatched to destroy the plant are killed when their glider hits the mountainside at night. An improvised raid by the resistance ends in the partial destruction of the heavy water canisters, but the contingency plans of Reichskommissar Terboven enable the Germans to resume production quickly. Pedersen wants to recommend to London that the Allies bomb the plant. Straud opposes him because of the potential death toll on Norwegian civilians and a fight ensues. They send in separate recommendations, and the air raid takes place, but it fails to destroy the heavy water. A Norwegian traitor gives away the resistance hideout, and Anna's uncle is killed. The Germans load the canisters onto a ferry for shipment to Germany, and the resistance rig explosives to sink the ferry in the fjord. As the ferry is about to leave, it is boarded by the widow and baby of one of Pedersen's and Straud's colleagues. Pedersen boards the ferry and organizes a children's game of ""lifejacket"" in order to minimize civilian deaths. The film closes with resistance members rescuing passengers as the ferry sinks.

However, his life soon starts to descend into a shambles after the arrival of a friend, Robert Reed, and a dreaded change to the flight order, whereby it becomes increasingly difficult to keep his three fiancées apart.

Or is it German national Lufthansa air hostess Lise Bruner? Or is it French national Air France air hostess Jacqueline Grieux? In fact, it's all three, but none of the three know about the other two. With a master airline schedule in hand, Bernard is able to schedule time separately with each of his three fiancées in the same apartment at different times - when one is in Paris, the other two are off flying around the world. Helping Bernard is his acerbic-tongued, efficient but slightly tired live-in maid, Bertha, who has to manage three sets each of photographs, clothing (two of which are always locked up) and bed linens, and has to remember that it is Vicky who eats kidneys, Lise who eats knockwurst and Jacqueline who eats soufflés. Trouble ensues when a rival reporter acquaintance, Robert Reed, comes to Paris. Upon finding out about Bernard's personal situation, Robert blackmails Bernard, the ransom for not exposing Bernard's secret to any of the three women being being able to stay at the apartment while in Paris. But Robert sees somewhat of a good thing, as when he learns that Bernard may be relocated to New York, Robert has dreams of taking over Bernard's Paris situation. But worse for Bernard is that British United, Lufthansa and Air France have all purchased new jumbo jets making air travel faster, which in turn means a whole revamp of their respective airline schedules and the schedules of the three fiancées.

                    When Singapore surrendered to the Japanese in 1942 the Allied POWs, mostly British but including a few Americans, were incarcerated in Changi prison. This was a POW detention center like no other. There were no walls or barbed-wire fences for the simple reason that there was no place for the prisoners to escape to. Included among the prisoners is the American Cpl. King, a wheeler dealer who has managed to established a pretty good life for himself in the camp. While most of the prisoners are near starvation and have uniforms that are in tatters, King eats well and and has crisp clean clothes to wear every day. His nemesis is Lt. Robin Grey, the camp Provost who attempts to keep good order and discipline. He knows that King is breaking camp rules by bartering with the Japanese but can't quite get the evidence he needs to stop him. King soon forms a friendship with Lt. Peter Marlowe an upper class British officer who is fascinated with King's élan and no rules approach to life. As the story develops, it reveals the hypocrisy of the British class system and for King, the fact that his position in Changi's ""society"" is tenuous as best.

                    The Japanese prisoner-of-war camp Changi in Singapore, which houses Allied POWs, is a living hell. The great mass of POWs are living at a sub-human subsistence level. US Army Corporal King has been living up to his surname, through his control of the camp's black market, and by scamming the officers and other POWs. King has a facility for making deals with the Japanese to obtain the contraband he sells to the POWs. His nemesis is British Lieutenant Robin Grey, the camp provost marshal, a humorless, intense martinet who survives through his strict adherence to the British articles of war, which forbid collaboration with the enemy. He is suspicious of King, and is determined to catch him and bring him to justice. The humorless Grey is an upright, uptight moral prig who has been as badly damaged psychologically as any of the other POWs. The high-living King befriends a genteel young British airman, Peter Marlowe, who at first resists his blandishments, and then succumbs, to his charm. The POWs become aware that the war is drawing to its end, and King and Marlowe grow concerned that the brutal Japanese guards may slaughter the prisoners before they can be liberated. King and Marlowe are determined to raise a large amount of money to buy their freedom by bribing their captors. One of the schemes that King devises is to sell the meat of mouse deer, a native delicacy, to sell to the high-ranking POW officers. Conditions are so desperate in the camp, that POWs are stealing rations form one another in order to stave off starvation. This is another one of King's scams, as the ""mouse deer"" meat is actually from rats, the breeding stock for which have been the rats that have fed off the corpses of dead POWs. The desperate situation in the camp is exacerbated by the brutality of the Japanese guards, and by the senior British officers' predilection for breaking the will of the POWs in order to maintain camp discipline. Resistance, thus, is futile, and with no other outlet, the animosity of the POWs has to be channeled against each other. It becomes quite apparent that, aside from Lieutenant Grey and the dead, everyone in the camp is corrupt. Corporal King merely stands out, as he is Jack-the-Lad, The King-of-the-Hill, King of the Camp, KING RAT.

The newspaper has printed the story that Wallingham will be shipping 40 wagons of liquor to Denver and Wallingham is concerned that the publicity will attract Indians, or even worse, government tax revenue agents. He tells the editor that as he has every penny he has tied up in the train and he intends to accompany it personally to Denver and ask for an army escort from Fort Russell to protect him along the trail. The editor, annoyed at Wallingham, decides to send a telegram about the wagon train to the well-known, temperance leader Cora Templeton Massingale (Lee Remick), who is currently visiting Fort Russell.Despite the editors observation to Wallingham that ""Indians don't read newspapers"" word of the wagon train quickly spreads to the Native Americans in the area. One tribe, lead by Chief Five Barrels (Robert J. Wilke) and sub-Chief Walks-Stooped-Over (Martin Landau) decides to investigate.At Fort Russell commander Col. Thaddeus Gearhart (Burt Lancaster) has been out on the trail for a few days and Capt. Paul Slater (Jim Hutton) his second-in-command, has been left in charge. Slater is courting Gearhart's daughter, Louise (Pamela Tiffin), and allows her to convince him to let Massingale hold an anti-alcohol rally at the Fort. Massingale is a good speaker and gets the crowd marching around the Fort and singing with the assistance of the army band. Some of the other troops get involved by punctuating the music with cannon fire.Gearhart, returning to the Fort, hears the shouting, bugles and cannon fire and assumes the Fort is under attack and arrives in full assault mode. When he finds it is just Massingale and her followers, he is peeved and orders Slater to report to him at his quarters. He is even more peeved when he finds Slater and his daughter are already alone in his quarters making out. Louise admits to her father that she was purposely distracting Slater so that he would not shut down the rally.Gearhart finally gets to settle down to a bath when Massingale storms into his quarters after getting the telegram about the Wallingham wagon train. Gearhart is clearly irked about having this 30ish, good-looking female invade his domain, but she tells him that to a woman that has already been windowed twice, seeing a man in a bath is no big deal. She demands that Gearhart deny the request for escort. Gearhart replies that Wallingham is a ""taxpayer and a good Republican"" and he cannot refuse his request for help. The next day Slater is sent with a company of troops to intercept the wagon train and give it escort.In Denver the miners become concerned about reports that the Indians may attack the wagon train and consult Jones again. He has a vision of a Miner's Militia that goes out to escort the train back and they set out along the trail.The wagon train is having some trouble too as Wallingham has hired Irish teamsters to drive the last 10 of his wagons and their leader, Kevin O'Flaherty (Tom Stern), is constantly hitting him with labor demands and threats to go out on strike.Persuaded by his daughter, Gearhart agrees to let Massingale use the mess hall for a goodbye speech. There Massingale declares that she intends to go to Denver to stop the train. Louise declares that she will go with her and the rest of the women at the rally decide to go too.Gearhart decides he had no choice but to escort the women to Denver, if for no other reason than to get rid of Massingale. Problems develop the first night on the trail when the women, having brought bath tubs with them, decide to bath in the nude and his troops climb the nearby trees hoping to catch a glimpse. Gearhart, annoyed by this development, storms over to Massingale and catches her in mid-bath (much as she did with him several days before). He is even more annoyed when she tells him her plans have changed and she has decided to meet the wagon train on the trail, and not in Denver. He tells her he will not escort her to the wagon train as he fears the women may try and stop it by throwing their bodies in front of the wagons.Gearhart realizes that he cannot let the women go without any protection, however, so he develops a strategy of ""detached contact"" where his company secretly follows the women at a distance.All this activity comes to a head one morning at what the narrator tells us is the ""Battle of Whiskey Hills."" The Indians decide to break into three groups, attack the wagon train, draw off the guard and steal several wagons. That same morning, however, the wagon train traveling west escorted by Slater's patrol will run into the Miner's Militia, heading North; the Massingale group, headed South-East; and Gearhart's company, also headed South-East. The Indians will attack from the North.Unfortunately, to make things worse, the morning of the attack is subject to a horrific, blinding sand storm and total confusion reigns. The Indians cannot see the sunrise, and cannot coordinate their attacks. Groups race by each other in the storm, perplexed by not finding who they are expecting to see. Bullets fly everywhere and finally each group, including the Indians, hunker down in a circle while they fire at each other blindly.When the storm clears Gearhart is amazed to find that despite the rampant gunfire, nobody has been killed. He holds a conference with all parties. While the motives of most are clear, the Indians state (through a translator) that they were peacefully hunting buffalo when they were drawn into the incident. They state that after they are given presents, they will go home. Unfortunately this is mistranslated and Gearhart thinks the Indians are offering him a gift. He tells them thank you, but no thanks, and sends them on their way.The Indians, however, keep following the group which is now composed of both units of the cavalry, the whiskey train, the womans group and the miners militia. Gearhart calls another meeting where he gets Jones to translate and realizes that the Indians are the ones who want presents, most likely some firewater. Gearhart tells them to go home, but they keep following.As they near a swampy area known as ""Quicksand Bottoms,"" Jones has a vision and directs Wallingham to camp the train next to the marsh for the night. At the same time the Irish teamsters, encouraged by Massingale, go on strike removing 10 wagons from the train. Willingham wants to take the wagons back by force, but Gearhart sees this as a labor dispute and threatens to use his troops to keep the peace.That night about 30 of the women go to a camp meeting with the Indians and get them to sign temperance pledges (though there is some doubt that the Indians know what they are signing). In the middle of the meeting the Indians take the women hostage and tell Gearhart they will not release them unless they get 20 of the Wallingham wagons. This is eventually bargained down to 10, the exact number held by the Irish Teamsters and Gearhart decides to make the exchange to save the womens lives.As it is illegal to give firewater to Indians, this will ruin Gearhart's career. Massingale comes to Gearhart's tent distraught about her part in this and asking his forgiveness. She breaks her own rule, drinks a few shots of whiskey and she and Gearhart have a tender moment.Wallingham is upset by these events but Jones comes to him with a way out. Jones knows a secret way across quicksand bottoms that can be used by the train to escape the rest of the group. During the night he has marked the path with sticks flagged with red strips from his underwear. While the 10 wagons are being exchanged with the Indians, the rest of the wagon train will slip away, pull up the flags as they go, and be in Denver before anybody knows what happened.The exchange is arranged for dawn the next day. The Indians will release three women for every wagon they get. At the last minute O'Flaherty confides in Massingale that the bottles in the 10 wagons aren't whiskey, but warm, volatile champagne that is likely to explode if treated roughly. This gives her an idea. As she is assigned a position at the exchange point, she can use a hatpin to prick the horses rear ends as soon as the Indian drivers climb onto the wagons. This sets the creatures into a gallop causing the wagons to shake and bounce uncontrollably on the rough ground. After the first few wagons are exchanged the remaining horses are so excited they stampede and the wagons head out with no drivers.The remaining Indians leave the rest of the women hostages behind and jump on their horses to pursue the wagons. The troops go after the Indians and mistake the sound of champagne bottles exploding for gunfire and surround the Indians and the wagons. The Indians, drunk and tired of the whole thing, surrender and decide to go peacefully home with just a few of the bottles of booze not destroyed in the chase.Meanwhile Wallingham and Jones try to slip away with the rest of the wagon train, but in the early hours of the morning Massingale and the women discovered the flags. Suspecting this was some scheme of Jones, they move the markers. This results in the wagons becoming hopelessly mired in the quicksand. Though the drivers and horses escape, the wagons themselves sink out of sight and Wallingham is forced into bankruptcy.With the whiskey gone, the women are escorted back to Fort Russell where, in a double wedding, Slater marries Louise and Gearhart marries Massingale, who has decided to retire from the temperance movement.Jones and Wallingham stake a homestead claim in Quicksand Bottoms where the occasional return to the surface of the bog of barrels of whiskey keeps them happy for a number of years.The miners return to Denver, where, despite all predations to the contrary, the winter turns out to be one of the mildest ones ever on record.","

    Synopsis
    The film opens with a narrator using a documentary style description of the events of November 1867. He tells us there were all indications that it will be a hard winter and citizens of Denver are concerned about the lack of whiskey in town. A bad winter might close the mountain passes leaving the city dry until late spring. A group of miners and saloon owners consult scout 'Oracle' Jones (Donald Pleasence) about what to do. Fortified with some whiskey he has a vision of them pooling all their liquor needs into one big order and getting a reliable company to agree to an iron clad contact to get the alcohol to Denver before snow closes the trails.Back east, businessman Frank Wallingham (Brian Keith) storms into the local newspaper office to confront Editor Hobbes (Whit Bissell).

Now she needs to receive the delivery men at the apartment she rented and she needs to leave Bunny for a moment and the cook says that she can check on her daughter. When Ann returns, she does not find neither the cook nor Bunny and no one in the nursery seems to have seen the girl. Ann calls her brother Steven Lake and the police. Superintendent Newhouse investigates the case with his men and there is no evidence of the little girl.

Ann's belief is tested when she goes to pick up Bunny after school, Bunny who is not there. No one at the school even remembers ever seeing Bunny. The only person in London who knows Ann and can vouch for her assertion is her brother, magazine reporter Steven Lake. Ann's worry is heightened because there have been a few child abductions and murders of late. The police are brought into the matter. The further that sympathetic lead investigator, Superintendent Newhouse, gets into the investigation, the more it seems like Bunny is a figment of Ann's imagination, her fantasy supported by Steven for her own mental well-being. Steven however seems convinced that someone knows of Bunny's disappearance, that someone perhaps being one of the plethora of school administrators including its elderly owner, Ada Ford, or the Lake's seemingly eccentric landlord, Horatio Wilson.

The army sends reservists, mostly married middle-aged men - and the local beauty Andula, spurns those bold enough to try to win her, for the jazz pianist, newly come from Prague to perform. He seduces her and impresses her, telling her ""most women are round, like guitars but you are a guitar by Picasso"". Staying the night with him causes a lecture on a young woman's honour at her hostel so she throws over her other suitors and makes her way to Prague to find the young man.

                    Newly arrived in Hollywood from England, Dennis Barlow finds he has to arrange his uncle's interment at the highly-organised and very profitable Whispering Glades funeral parlour. His fancy is caught by one of their cosmeticians, Aimee Thanatogenos. But he has three problems - the strict rules of owner Blessed Reverand Glenworthy, the rivalry of embalmer Mr Joyboy, and the shame of now working himself at The Happy Hunting Ground pets' memorial home.

                    Whispering Glades is a funeral home in Los Angeles. The staff there take their role in life - and death - very seriously, wanting to make the funeral process as beautiful and meaningful as possible. This at least is the outward perception of the organization, and the life goal of Whispering Glades make-up artist, Aimee Thanatogenous, whose professional goal is to become the first female embalmer. In her mind, beauty trumps all else. She catches the eye of Dennis Barlow, recently arrived in Los Angeles from Britain, and who is at Whispering Glades to arrange the funeral of his uncle, Sir Francis Hinsley. Dennis does whatever he feels he needs to to gain the favor of Aimee. Standing in his way is his work at Happy Hunting Grounds, a pet funeral home that steals Whispering Glades philosophy, his job there about which he doesn't tell her, and the attention she receives from the embalmer at Whispering Glades, Dr. Joyboy. But Whispering Glades may not be all that Aimee thinks it is, which could affect her relationship with Dennis and her view on life and death.

In the US version they are listed by more American-sounding names. Below they are listed by their real Italian names.**Muriel Hampton Arrowsmith (Barbara Steele) has entered the lab of her husband Dr. Stephen Arrowsmith (Paul Muller) with a drink. He chastises her for entering without permission, commenting on her drinking. She acknowledges that he is leaving for a scientific conference where he will be with other  fanatical good-for-nothings like yourself  she taunts. He tells her not to speak to him like that. She reminds him that she is his wife and would like to spend the night with him. They kiss. Muriel notices that this has been observed by Solange (Helga Liné), who is waiting to see him off on his long journey. They say their goodbyes and he tells her he will only be a couple of days gone. The carriage is brought up by David (Rik Battaglia) who asks about the new plants. He is told to water them in the greenhouse. Dr. Arrowsmith leaves.Muriel goes to the piano and plays music. Hearing this, David drops what he is doing and heads into the house to meet her. Muriel disrobes, puts on her nightgown and perfume and begins passionate kissing with David, which progresses to the bed. She stops, suggesting they are too near Solanges room and they should go to the greenhouse. Once there, they lie down and begin passionate kissing.Outside we see Dr. Arrowsmith waiting and watching for a signal from Solange. From an upstairs window we see a light flashing back and forth. Holding his cane, he enters the greenhouse and confronts the lovers. He strikes David in the face with his cane, then his wife. Next we see both of them strung up on a wall with Stephen whipping them. He uses a heated poker on David. Next we see Stephen pouring a glass of water from a pitcher. Both look thirsty and Muriel begs for a sip. He brings it close, then pours it out. She curses him with her hatred, but then confesses that she recently remade her will, leaving all her wealth to her step-sister Jenny.Stephen is pouring through a book, presumably a law book, as he plans what he will do. Solange tells him he will have to keep her alive, but that Solange wants her share of the money that he has promised her. He reassures her that he will win and Solange will get what is coming to her. Then he says Jenny will inherit the money, but everyone knows Jenny is mad. She will be confined to a mental hospital and he will discover the cure.Next we see Muriel and David in the bedroom with Muriel chained to the bed and David chained to a chair. Stephen drips acid onto Muriel from a contraption and she cries out. David cries out as well, seeing her suffer. Stephen releases him from the chair and he rises, to be pushed onto the bed with her. Still shackled on his feet with wires connected, Stephen turns on a switch which electrocutes them both in bed. They cry out.Stephen is seen removing her heart from her corpse, which he places in a water tank along with the heart of David. Next we see her ashes placed in an urn with a strange plant.Stephen arrives at the castle with Jenny, who he has just married, having gotten her from the asylum. Solange is annoyed that he married her against their plan. He consoles Solange (who appears years younger) that once Jenny is insane enough to commit that he will be named over her estate and then Solange will get her money. In the meantime, he will see to it that Jenny goes mad.He prepares a hallucinogen to be added to Jennys drink which Solange adds. That night Jenny hears two hearts beating and gets up. She opens a door to find wind and a laughing womans voice. Seeing the plant, which has almost bloomed, she notices drops of blood beside it. She gets back in bed with Stephen, who pretends to be asleep. Later she tells him about her dream and the blood. He tells her it is only a nightmare.Jenny and Stephen are seen at a fountain with white doves. Jenny asks questions about Muriel and Stephen fills her in. She apologizes to Stephen for her outburst last night. He tells her if could be nothing other than delirium, which he hopes will not happen again. Solange comes to tell him that the lab is ready. He goes with her, leaving Jenny at the fountain.In the lab, he finds that one vial is still present in the cabinet: the vial of hallucinogen that Jenny was supposed to have received last night. Solange apologizes and says it couldnt be. He insists otherwise, but tells her that regardless, Jenny seems to not need the drug to go over the edge. He kisses Solange.Jenny finds the sheet music on the piano and asks if Muriel wrote it. She is told that Muriel occasionally did write music. Jenny attempts to play the theme. As the music plays, she seems to become more like Muriel and asks for a drink. The servant brings it, and she remarks that she likes it. Stephen throws down a medical journal that he doesnt care for and complains about the doctor who wrote it. After the music has stopped, he notices that Jenny is gone. He and Solange go to her room, but she is not there. Then a scream is heard. Solange says that it comes from below. They head toward the passage leading down to the crypt. Another scream is heard before they reach it. At the bottom of the stairs, they push open a door to find Jenny white as a ghost, collapsing. Stephen carries her up to her bed. They discuss what happened and she cannot remember parts of it, only that her hands were bloody and she tried to remove the covering to the crypt. He tells her it was all in her imagination. She insists that the door to the crypt was locked, but he says no, it was easily opened when he pushed on it. He tells her that her condition frequently causes things to seem impossible. She begs him not send her back to the asylum and he agrees, but tells her he wants her to get better. Dr. Joyce (Marino Masé) will come and take care of her, since he did for so many years at the hospital.When Dr. Joyce arrives, he is greeted by Stephen and Jenny, who tries to sweep him away to the woods. Stephen intervenes, suggesting that the doctor has just arrived. Dr. Joyce says it is all right, but Jenny agrees that her husband is right, leaving and going inside.Dr. Joyce talks to Jenny about remembering all that has happened to her. He says Stephen has told him everything that has happened recently. She remembers something about David but gets confused. He asks what happened. She tells him that someone else takes over her mind and that then she gets confused. She remembers the crypt and the greenhouse, so they go there in an effort to remember. She says someone was kissing her, but she cant remember who. Someone else came in and struck him. She tells Dr. Joyce that she lost an earring which should be in the leaves below. When he finds it, she seems to recognize it but then when questioned further becomes confused. He suggests maybe she lost it another time. Then she admits that it is not her earring and she has never seen it before.In Dr. Arrowsmiths study, Solange breaks a bottle and he chides her, telling her he was able to restore her youth but not her mind. She reminds him that it is not her mind that he needs. Dr. Joyce comes in to discuss Jennys condition, showing him the earring that she found in the greenhouse. Stephen tells Solange to go find the other earring in Jennys room. Going to a secret location, Solange gets the other earring and goes to Jennys room (which Stephen says has changed per Dr. Joyce). She slips it into the jewel box and tells Jenny the Doctor wants to see it. When Jenny shows her jewelry to Dr. Joyce, she finds the other earring and becomes confused. Stephen brings over the other one, explaining that they are Muriels earrings and that Jenny has never worn them. Confused, she leaves the room.At dinner, Dr. Joyce is discussing wizards and witches of Africa who made contact with the dead, when suddenly Jenny rises, announcing she is tired and will turn it. Stephen tells her he will follow immediately. Jenny leaves and the doctors discuss her condition. All at once Solange cries out, having apparently cut herself. Stephen attends to her, telling Dr. Joyce he will have to take her to the lab to prevent a hemorrhage. He explains that she has a rare blood disorder but that it is nothing. As they leave the room, Dr. Joyce notices her place at the table, looking closely at it. The butler comes in and asks if he wants anything, to which he replies no. Announcing that he will go to his room, he leaves. The butler also looks at the place he was looking.Upstairs, Dr. Joyce finds his room locked and knocks, asking who is there. Behind him there is a noise and he looks around to find a passageway opening in a panel in the wall. He goes through.In the lab, Stephen tells Solange that they will need new blood. He draws some from a container and gives her an injection. He says this worked for now but soon they will need some new solution.Jenny awakens to the sound of the hearts beating. She hears Muriels voice telling her that her blood is being used down in the laboratory and to hurry. Jenny gets up and begins to go.Dr. Joyce finds himself in the crypt looking at graves. He finds Muriels crypt and the lid slides over, revealing it to be empty.Jenny enters the lab and picking up a scalpel, he goes to attack Stephen, who is attending to Solange. Solange cries out as she sees her coming. Striking his face with the scalpel, Jenny renders a cut on Stephen just as Dr. Joyce enters. He takes Jenny back to her room. Solange tells Stephen that it was not the face of Jenny but Muriel.In her room, Jenny draws Dr. Joyce to sit in bed with her. He speaks to her and she looks strangely at him, asking who he is. She tells him she is not Jenny, but Muriel and kisses him. Again he calls Jenny and she kisses him again. Suddenly the doors fly open and a breeze blows through. Seeing no one, Dr. Joyce returns to Jenny, who asks if he saw what she saw. He tells her that he will find out what it was. In the greenhouse, Jenny asks the doctor what Muriel wants with her. He tells her that she must leave these surroundings in order to get better.Solange tells Stephen that the doctor is now a threat and cannot be allowed to leave the castle. He agrees with her. At that moment Dr. Joyce enters and asks to speak to him. Solange leaves. He tells Stephen that he will take Jenny back to the clinic in the morning so she can get better. Stephen agrees and Dr. Joyce retires to his room, beginning to write. Next he calls the butler to prepare his bath. Meanwhile Stephen drills a hole in the wall in the bathroom and connects wires to electrocute Dr. Joyce when he steps into the tub. Before Joyce can do that, the butler returns with towels and fixes them on a rack by the tub. As he brushes by the tub, he accidently knocks the soap bar into the water. Hearing activity, Stephen prepares to throw the switch and does. When he reaches for the soap he cries out as he is electrocuted. Dr. Joyce removes him and next they are seen discussing his death. Joyce pronounces a heart attack and Stephen tells Solange to take Jenny away.Stephen asks Joyce to prepare a death certificate and help move his body back to his room. When that is done, Joyce wants to light a candle for the dead while Stephen leaves. After they both leave the room, the butlers hand falls to the side, revealing a burn on his wrist from the electric shock.Solange meets Stephen in the hall, confessing she is frightened and uncertain of what to do now. He reassures her everything will go as planned. He goes to speak to Jenny, telling her she has been through a shock. She says she is anxious to leave in the morning with Dr. Joyce. At this point he turns on her, accusing Dr. Joyce of manipulating her because she is weak, beautiful and rich. She swears he has done nothing wrong and that they have been friends for many years. He tells her he saw them holding hands in the greenhouse and that he doesnt want to lose her. He persuades her to come with him to Spain or Italy and she agrees.Next we see Dr. Joyce reluctantly telling Jenny that it will be good for her to go elsewhere. She acts as if he might be talking down to her. He tells her he will be leaving in the morning, but that he is very fond of her and if she ever needs anything for her to call upon him. She cries.That night she is dreaming as Muriel again and Dr. Joyce comes in and observes her as she writhes. He asks if it is Muriel and asks where her body is and who killed her. When Stephen comes into the room, he hides behind draperies. Jenny screams when she sees Stephen.Solange begs Stephen for the blood of Jenny to replenish her, saying that Muriels blood is heavy within her, like mercury. He promises that Jennys blood will be available soon.Next morning Dr. Joyce is saying goodbye when Jenny approaches and asks why he is leaving. She asks him if he likes the Hampton Crest which is at the base of a statue of two lovers. She seems more like Muriel. He bids them goodbye and leaves. Solange seems in pain waiting for the new blood.Jenny is seen in her room, packing. Thunder is heard outside. Jenny approaches Stephen and calls him. He comes toward her with a murderous look and slaps her down. Grabbing her, he tells Solange to come to the lab. Meanwhile in the rain we see Dr. Joyce who has returned and enters the castle. Inside, he looks at the Hampton Crest, finally turning it clockwise, which opens a cabinet door. Inside is the container with the two hearts of Muriel and David. He carries it to the desk and removes the dagger. The cries of Muriel and David are heard by Dr. Joyce and seen looking down from a high position.In the lab Stephen tells Jenny that her sister is calling her and that we will no longer have to deal with hearing her cries anymore. Solange cries out that she cant stand it. Stephen brings cotton dipped in ether and puts Jenny to sleep. Solange is told to lie on the other berth. After they are connected with tubes, Stephen tells Solange it will take about two hours and for her to remain still while he prepares for the trip the three of them will make.Stephen comes out and sees Muriel and David with their wounds, facing Dr. Joyce. Stephen hits Joyce from behind with a candlestick, knocking him out. Muriel takes Stephen aside, telling him she will help him see the ecstasy of pain and death that she has. As he pulls her hair aside, he sees her hideously deformed face. She laughs and secures him in the chair, throwing a candle and setting him on fire. Meanwhile David enters the lab and Solange, seeing him, screams. He cuts the blood line, laughing, and it drips on the floor. Next we see Stephens chair with his body completely burnt up. Muriel stops laughing. Solange is shown back in her old body again as David laughs, destroying the lab equipment. Next we see Solange as only a skeleton.Dr. Joyce recovers and stands up. David approaches Jenny on the table and shakes her. She awakens and screams. At this point Dr. Joyce comes in and pulls David away into the lab which is filling with smoke. He picks Jenny up and carries her out. Upstairs they lock the doors to keep David out and turn to run. Jenny is horrified to see Muriel coming toward them. David breaks the doors open and comes in. At this point Dr. Joyce takes the two hearts and throws them into the fire. As they burn, Muriel and David disappear. Dr. Joyce and Jenny run outside into the rain. As they pause and look back, he tells her she is safe now and will have no more problems from Muriel. The two hearts are shown again burning in the fireplace.","

Stephen throws down a medical journal that he doesnt care for and complains about the doctor who wrote it. After the music has stopped, he notices that Jenny is gone. He and Solange go to her room, but she is not there. Then a scream is heard. Solange says that it comes from below. They head toward the passage leading down to the crypt. Another scream is heard before they reach it. At the bottom of the stairs, they push open a door to find Jenny white as a ghost, collapsing. Stephen carries her up to her bed. They discuss what happened and she cannot remember parts of it, only that her hands were bloody and she tried to remove the covering to the crypt. He tells her it was all in her imagination. She insists that the door to the crypt was locked, but he says no, it was easily opened when he pushed on it. He tells her that her condition frequently causes things to seem impossible. She begs him not send her back to the asylum and he agrees, but tells her he wants her to get better. Dr. Joyce (Marino Masé) will come and take care of her, since he did for so many years at the hospital.When Dr. Joyce arrives, he is greeted by Stephen and Jenny, who tries to sweep him away to the woods. Stephen intervenes, suggesting that the doctor has just arrived. Dr. Joyce says it is all right, but Jenny agrees that her husband is right, leaving and going inside.Dr. Joyce talks to Jenny about remembering all that has happened to her. He says Stephen has told him everything that has happened recently. She remembers something about David but gets confused. He asks what happened. She tells him that someone else takes over her mind and that then she gets confused. She remembers the crypt and the greenhouse, so they go there in an effort to remember. She says someone was kissing her, but she cant remember who. Someone else came in and struck him. She tells Dr. Joyce that she lost an earring which should be in the leaves below. When he finds it, she seems to recognize it but then when questioned further becomes confused. He suggests maybe she lost it another time. Then she admits that it is not her earring and she has never seen it before.In Dr. Arrowsmiths study, Solange breaks a bottle and he chides her, telling her he was able to restore her youth but not her mind. She reminds him that it is not her mind that he needs. Dr. Joyce comes in to discuss Jennys condition, showing him the earring that she found in the greenhouse. Stephen tells Solange to go find the other earring in Jennys room. Going to a secret location, Solange gets the other earring and goes to Jennys room (which Stephen says has changed per Dr. Joyce). She slips it into the jewel box and tells Jenny the Doctor wants to see it. When Jenny shows her jewelry to Dr. Joyce, she finds the other earring and becomes confused. Stephen brings over the other one, explaining that they are Muriels earrings and that Jenny has never worn them. Confused, she leaves the room.At dinner, Dr. Joyce is discussing wizards and witches of Africa who made contact with the dead, when suddenly Jenny rises, announcing she is tired and will turn it. Stephen tells her he will follow immediately. Jenny leaves and the doctors discuss her condition. All at once Solange cries out, having apparently cut herself. Stephen attends to her, telling Dr. Joyce he will have to take her to the lab to prevent a hemorrhage. He explains that she has a rare blood disorder but that it is nothing. As they leave the room, Dr. Joyce notices her place at the table, looking closely at it. The butler comes in and asks if he wants anything, to which he replies no. Announcing that he will go to his room, he leaves. The butler also looks at the place he was looking.Upstairs, Dr. Joyce finds his room locked and knocks, asking who is there. Behind him there is a noise and he looks around to find a passageway opening in a panel in the wall. He goes through.In the lab, Stephen tells Solange that they will need new blood. He draws some from a container and gives her an injection. He says this worked for now but soon they will need some new solution.Jenny awakens to the sound of the hearts beating. She hears Muriels voice telling her that her blood is being used down in the laboratory and to hurry. Jenny gets up and begins to go.Dr. Joyce finds himself in the crypt looking at graves. He finds Muriels crypt and the lid slides over, revealing it to be empty.Jenny enters the lab and picking up a scalpel, he goes to attack Stephen, who is attending to Solange. Solange cries out as she sees her coming. Striking his face with the scalpel, Jenny renders a cut on Stephen just as Dr. Joyce enters. He takes Jenny back to her room. Solange tells Stephen that it was not the face of Jenny but Muriel.In her room, Jenny draws Dr. Joyce to sit in bed with her. He speaks to her and she looks strangely at him, asking who he is. She tells him she is not Jenny, but Muriel and kisses him. Again he calls Jenny and she kisses him again. Suddenly the doors fly open and a breeze blows through. Seeing no one, Dr. Joyce returns to Jenny, who asks if he saw what she saw. He tells her that he will find out what it was. In the greenhouse, Jenny asks the doctor what Muriel wants with her. He tells her that she must leave these surroundings in order to get better.Solange tells Stephen that the doctor is now a threat and cannot be allowed to leave the castle. He agrees with her. At that moment Dr. Joyce enters and asks to speak to him. Solange leaves. He tells Stephen that he will take Jenny back to the clinic in the morning so she can get better. Stephen agrees and Dr. Joyce retires to his room, beginning to write. Next he calls the butler to prepare his bath. Meanwhile Stephen drills a hole in the wall in the bathroom and connects wires to electrocute Dr. Joyce when he steps into the tub. Before Joyce can do that, the butler returns with towels and fixes them on a rack by the tub. As he brushes by the tub, he accidently knocks the soap bar into the water. Hearing activity, Stephen prepares to throw the switch and does. When he reaches for the soap he cries out as he is electrocuted. Dr. Joyce removes him and next they are seen discussing his death. Joyce pronounces a heart attack and Stephen tells Solange to take Jenny away.Stephen asks Joyce to prepare a death certificate and help move his body back to his room. When that is done, Joyce wants to light a candle for the dead while Stephen leaves. After they both leave the room, the butlers hand falls to the side, revealing a burn on his wrist from the electric shock.Solange meets Stephen in the hall, confessing she is frightened and uncertain of what to do now. He reassures her everything will go as planned. He goes to speak to Jenny, telling her she has been through a shock. She says she is anxious to leave in the morning with Dr. Joyce. At this point he turns on her, accusing Dr. Joyce of manipulating her because she is weak, beautiful and rich. She swears he has done nothing wrong and that they have been friends for many years. He tells her he saw them holding hands in the greenhouse and that he doesnt want to lose her. He persuades her to come with him to Spain or Italy and she agrees.Next we see Dr. Joyce reluctantly telling Jenny that it will be good for her to go elsewhere. She acts as if he might be talking down to her. He tells her he will be leaving in the morning, but that he is very fond of her and if she ever needs anything for her to call upon him. She cries.That night she is dreaming as Muriel again and Dr. Joyce comes in and observes her as she writhes. He asks if it is Muriel and asks where her body is and who killed her. When Stephen comes into the room, he hides behind draperies. Jenny screams when she sees Stephen.Solange begs Stephen for the blood of Jenny to replenish her, saying that Muriels blood is heavy within her, like mercury. He promises that Jennys blood will be available soon.Next morning Dr. Joyce is saying goodbye when Jenny approaches and asks why he is leaving. She asks him if he likes the Hampton Crest which is at the base of a statue of two lovers. She seems more like Muriel. He bids them goodbye and leaves. Solange seems in pain waiting for the new blood.Jenny is seen in her room, packing. Thunder is heard outside. Jenny approaches Stephen and calls him. He comes toward her with a murderous look and slaps her down. Grabbing her, he tells Solange to come to the lab. Meanwhile in the rain we see Dr. Joyce who has returned and enters the castle. Inside, he looks at the Hampton Crest, finally turning it clockwise, which opens a cabinet door. Inside is the container with the two hearts of Muriel and David. He carries it to the desk and removes the dagger. The cries of Muriel and David are heard by Dr. Joyce and seen looking down from a high position.In the lab Stephen tells Jenny that her sister is calling her and that we will no longer have to deal with hearing her cries anymore. Solange cries out that she cant stand it. Stephen brings cotton dipped in ether and puts Jenny to sleep. Solange is told to lie on the other berth. After they are connected with tubes, Stephen tells Solange it will take about two hours and for her to remain still while he prepares for the trip the three of them will make.Stephen comes out and sees Muriel and David with their wounds, facing Dr. Joyce. Stephen hits Joyce from behind with a candlestick, knocking him out. Muriel takes Stephen aside, telling him she will help him see the ecstasy of pain and death that she has. As he pulls her hair aside, he sees her hideously deformed face. She laughs and secures him in the chair, throwing a candle and setting him on fire. Meanwhile David enters the lab and Solange, seeing him, screams. He cuts the blood line, laughing, and it drips on the floor. Next we see Stephens chair with his body completely burnt up. Muriel stops laughing. Solange is shown back in her old body again as David laughs, destroying the lab equipment. Next we see Solange as only a skeleton.Dr. Joyce recovers and stands up. David approaches Jenny on the table and shakes her. She awakens and screams. At this point Dr. Joyce comes in and pulls David away into the lab which is filling with smoke. He picks Jenny up and carries her out. Upstairs they lock the doors to keep David out and turn to run. Jenny is horrified to see Muriel coming toward them. David breaks the doors open and comes in. At this point Dr. Joyce takes the two hearts and throws them into the fire. As they burn, Muriel and David disappear. Dr. Joyce and Jenny run outside into the rain. As they pause and look back, he tells her she is safe now and will have no more problems from Muriel. The two hearts are shown again burning in the fireplace.

                    Twelve-year-old Nick lives with his Uncle Murray, a Mr. Micawber-like Dickensian character who keeps hoping something won't turn up. What turns up is a social worker, who falls in love with Murray and a bit in love with Nick. As the child welfare people try to force Murray to become a conventional man (as the price they demand for allowing him to keep Nick), the nephew, who until now has gloried in his Uncle's iconoclastic approach to life, tries to play mediator. But when he succeeds, he is alarmed by the uncle's willingness to cave in to society in order to save the relationship.

One of his latest non-beliefs is in work, most specifically the nine-to-five rat race, he five months ago quitting his job as a writer on a children's television series, and being unemployed ever since. He has for seven years taken care of his twelve year old nephew, who attends the Revere School for gifted children. He was abandoned by his never married mother, Murray's sister Elaine, whose current whereabouts are unknown and who also never gave him a name, including no last name. Murray has made an agreement with him that he could call himself whatever he wanted until he turned thirteen - which will be in four weeks - when they would apply to give him a legal name. He currently goes by the name Nick, which Murray believes is what he will eventually choose as that legal name. Murray and Nick's situation comes to the attention of the Child Welfare Board, who could take Nick away from Murray as he has never been officially Nick's guardian and as Murray may not be deemed as a suitable one, having no job. The case workers for the Child Welfare Board are the administrator, the officious Albert Amundson, and the child psychologist, the more emotionally sensitive Dr. Sandra Markowitz, who Murray can see just by their interactions with each other are also in a personal relationship with each other. While Murray does make an impression on the pair, he knows that to keep Nick, who he truly does love, he will have to make some quick concessions to show that he is taking steps to being a responsible guardian to the Board. The questions become how far Murray will go for Nick, especially to get work in his field, the nature of television having gone downhill in his opinion, but perhaps more importantly how far Nick will let Murray go to change from the man he knows and loves.

When he tries to get a cab ride, the cabbie refuses to take him to the Witley place. He goes over to a local storefront and asks for the Witley place. A man and woman refuse to help and leave, giving him odd looks. The woman stops and informs a group of old men that he is coming and leaves. When Stephen asks about renting a car, he is told that he might be able to rent a bicycle. When he tells them he is going to the Witley place, they laugh and repeat what he says. No one will tell him why the subject is taboo.At the bicycle shop the proprietor refuses to rent anything when he finds Stephen is going to the Witleys. He is advised to walk there.Going along dirt roads, Stephen passes a barren wasteland with a tar pit. All the trees in the area look burnt to a crisp. He pinches off part of a small branch and notices it is completely burned up.Arriving at the Witley gate, he finds it padlocked with signs saying TRESPASSING FORBIDDEN. Looking for a way in, he finds a large trap set. Using his briefcase to spring the trap, he steps over it and into the Witley property. The entire area is smoky and hazy, with an eerie quality. As he approaches the huge house, a dark figure cloaked in black watches.He knocks upon the door, getting no response. He knocks again and the double doors open on their own. He enters and looks around. His footsteps echo on the stone floors. He calls Hello a couple of times to no response. Suddenly a large grandfather clock chimes. The clock shows 4:15.He turns and sees Nahum Witley (Boris Karloff) staring at him from a wheelchair. Stephen apologizes and tells Witley that he took the liberty of coming in when there was no response. Witley questions what business a stranger has coming in unannounced and uninvited. Stephen produces a folded letter which he gives to Witley, explaining that he has been invited by Mrs. Witley. Merwyn the butler (Terence de Marney) watches. Witley remarks how his daughter Susan (Suzan Farmer) has mentioned his name. After discussing how Stephen and Susan met in college in America, Witley tells him he must leave. Stephen says it is not Mrs. Witley he is here to see but Susan. At this point Susan calls out from the top of the stairs and runs down to greet Stephen. Witley says for Stephen to tell her that he must leave at once and cannot explain why at this time. He tells Merwyn to get the car ready.Susan is overjoyed to see Steve and invites him up to meet her mother. Witley insists that it is forbidden for his wife to have visitors. Susan says its only for a few minutes and that her mother has been waiting to meet him. As they go upstairs, she shows him a portrait of her great grandfather who built the house over 150 years ago. The next portrait is of her grandfather whom she says went insane. Witley, watching them go upstairs, says to Merwyn that Stephen must not stay.Susan explains to Stephen that her mother is not well. They enter and she addresses her mother, Letitia Witley (Freda Jackson), who tells them to come in and close the door. They approach the bed which is shrouded in netting. Susan introduces Stephen and Letitia tells him that he is expected and welcome. She asks to speak to Stephen alone and Susan exits. Letitia tells Stephen to sit down and he does so.Meanwhile Witley descends on an old elevator with a pulley chain. Merwyn meets him at the bottom and wheels him through dark corridors. At one point Merwyn almost collapses and Witley asks if hes all right. He answers that he is and that he can be trusted.Stephen asks why all the questions. Letitia tells him to come close and take a wooden box by the bed. Inside is a golden earring which she says belonged to her maid who came down with a strange disease. It is explained that the disease caused her to hide under a veil and not want anyone to see her.Witley and Merwyn go through an underground chamber containing a vertical door laden with cut squares from which steam escapes around the sides. Witley rummages through a box with chains and random machine parts but finds nothing he wants. He goes to another spot and recoils when he sees a rat there.Letitia tells Stephen that the maid came back to see her and said she was afraid of what she had become. She dropped the earring as she was leaving and has not been seen since. Letitia wants Stephen to promise to take Susan away the next day.Witley and Merwyn are seen chaining up the door to a greenhouse. Stephen comes out and tells Susan he has the mothers blessing. She shows him his room, where he asks how long the mother has been sick and if the doctor had forbid her to have visitors. Susan explains that it has only been a few weeks and that Witley refused to let her see a doctor. Stephen asks about the maid, whom he says the mother was very concerned about. She asks what else they talked about. He tells her that her mother was interested in whether or not his intentions were honorable. They kiss, which is observed by Witley, who is sneaking a look from the door.Witley goes and tells his wife that she should not have invited Reinhart there. There is talk about how evil the grandfather was, but Witley explains that he has long been dead and that the evil is buried with him. She says how much he has become like his father, who consorted with demons. He denies being like his father, claiming it is she who is obsessed with the subject. He pours himself a drink, saying that whatever happened to his father will not happen to him. She says its already happening and that she witnessed the elder change from an upright God-fearing man to one possessed by the devil. She insists than Corbin was calling upon the dark forces at the time of his death and now they are here. She wants Stephen to take Susan away. He wants Stephen to leave and not interfere. She threatens to go into town and show everyone what the former beauty Letitia Witley looks like now. He agrees that Stephen can stay one night, but no more.Merwyn is serving soup to Witley, Susan and Stephen at a dining table. He clumsily almost drops the soup in front of Witley and apologizes. Stephen sips his soup and looks around curiously. Susan smiles at him. Witley looks very concerned and shows no appetite. Trying to make conversation, Stephen remarks how big and regal the room is. Susan says there used to be banquets there in her great grandfathers time. There have been none in her recent memory. Stephen asks why and Witley says that the name of Witley no longer commands the respect it once did. Stephen says that must be why no one in the village would have anything to do with them. Witley agrees and says the feeling is mutual. He asks if Mrs. Witley has had her supper. Merwyn says he took up a tray but she wouldnt touch it. Susan offers to take something up to her mother later.At this point a horrible shriek is heard echoing through the house. Stephen asks what it was but Witley doesnt answer. So Stephen asks about the burned area. Witley remains silent, but Susan tells him that there was a fire. She admits she hasnt seen it, because her father has forbidden her to go to the heath. Stephen says nothing grows there and how strange it is. Witley repeats that Susan has already told him that a fire was there. Stephen responds that no fire leaves an area like that. Susan says a few villagers disappeared in that area.Merwyn, who has been carving meat, brings some to the table and collapses on the floor, pulling the tablecloth and dishes off. They crowd around him and Stephen asks whats wrong. Witley tells him that he knows exactly what to do and that this has happened before. He tells Susan to take Stephen out of the room.Later, Susan takes a tray of food to her mother, who refuses to eat. Letitia tells Susan to be quiet and listen. Nothing is heard, but Letitia answers  yes. Yes.  as if answering someone.Stephen looks through an old book in the library. He hears a noise behind him but sees no one. He picks up another large old book. It bears the name of Corbin Witley and the title  CULT OF THE OUTER ONES.  Another pages states:  CURSED IS THE GROUND WHERE THE DARK FORCES LIVE, NEW AND STRANGELY BODIED. HE WHO TAMPERS THERE WILL BE DESTROYED. Susan, in her room, turns and is horrified to see the black figure looking in at her from the window. She screams and runs to Stephens room. Hearing the scream, he leaves the library and also goes to his room. She rushes to his arms and tells him of someone looking at her from the window. He asks if she was imagining it. She wearily answers that she doesnt know. She says that there is something smothering about the house. He tells her that he is taking her away and they embrace. He suggests they leave tonight. She insists that she cant leave her mother in such a weakened condition. He reminds Susan that it was her mother who asked him to take her away. He says tonight but she refuses. Then he says first thing in the morning. She answers that her mother may not be any better then. Suddenly the figure appears at the window and she calls out. When Stephen looks, the figure has moved on. He suggests it is her imagination and tells her to get some sleep before tomorrow. They kiss.A candle is extinguished by a black and gnarly hand as the lights go out in the mothers room. Stephen is back reading from the old book when he hears another shriek. He goes to investigate and Susan joins him in her nightgown and robe, carrying a candle. He tells her it came from downstairs.As they descend the staircase, another anguished cry is heard echoing through the house. They go further in the darkened house and hear something falling. As they pass by a fireplace, a burnt log falls out. They continue on to a door and Stephen asks what room it leads to. Susan tells him it is Merwyns room. They open the door and creep in. They come to another door, and just as Stephen is about to grab the doorknob, it opens to reveal Witley, who appears distraught. He tells Susan that they shouldnt have come down here. Stephen said they heard the screams. Witley tells them that is was Merwyn, who is now dead. Stephen wants to know how he died and see the body, but Witley refuses, saying he will run his own household. Stephen insists that a man has died, but Witley closes the door behind him, and Susan pulls him away. Inside, Witley pours a glass of wine and drinks it.Stephen tries to insist that they leave immediately, but Susan refuses. After she goes back to her room, Stephen goes back downstairs. He sees Witley rolling the body of Merwyn out of the house and into the greenhouse. Witley is standing as he moves the body inside.Stephen enters Merwyns room and looks around. On the floor he sees what looks like burn marks in the shape of a body. He goes outside and sees Whitley digging a grave. Going to the glowing greenhouse, he finds it padlocked. He leaves before Witley can get there. Witley checks the greenhouse door and finds it still locked. Stephen runs back into the house and climbs upstairs. Witley follows. Blowing out the candle in his room, Stephen gets under the covers in bed and pretends to be asleep when Witley looks in on him. Coming alongside the bed, Witley reaches to grasp the candlestick, but a noise is heard as of something falling. Witley leaves the room and Stephen gets up and closes the door.Stephen goes out at first light onto the grounds. The black figure is seen and a shriek is heard. The figure attacks Stephen with a knife and he sees that the face is distorted and freakish. He escapes the attack and the figure leaves.Stephen goes into town and enters a phone booth but only looks in the phone book. Having located a doctor, he goes to the doctors house and is admitted. Dr. Henderson (Patrick Magee) comes in and begins drinking. He explains that he has been retired for some time. Stephen wants to know why everyone is afraid of the Witleys. Henderson refuses to talk about it and tells him to leave. On the way out, the woman Miss Bailey tells him that Corbin Witley died in Dr. Hendersons arms. There was no autopsy, no body, and no one saw him but Dr. Henderson. He was never the same after that and retired.Susan tries to get her mother to open the bedroom door, but there is no answer. Witley comes and sends her away. He tries to convince Letitia to open up. Inside we see that the room is in shambles, clothing strewn all around on the floor and furniture turned over.Susan and Stephen walk outside and he tells her about the glowing light inside the greenhouse. He says it resembled something he saw once in a radiation lab. He tells her that he saw Witley burying Merwyn last night. He also is sure that the black figure who attacked him was the maid Helga. He says the greenhouse is padlocked. They go there.Witley speaks to his wife through the door, telling her that he will take her to the doctor. She is seen cowering in the corner of the room, moaning. As she turns, we see that half of her face is deformed.Seeing that the greenhouse is locked up, Stephen asks if there is another way in. She is reluctant, but he convinces her it is important to find what is inside. She shows him how she used to get in the greenhouse through a side panel. They enter and see fantastic plants beyond their normal size. A strange droning sound is heard. They find many flowers and plants of unusual size. Then another shriek is heard. Susan says the back room used to be a potters shed. Stephen insists that they find out what is in the darkened room. She is afraid what her father will do, but Stephen convinces her that this is what is affecting her whole family and they will not leave until they understand everything. She agrees to come with him.Inside the room they find a glowing substance which he says is radioactive. Another shriek causes Stephen to shine a light where he sees a number of grotesque creatures in cages. He remarks  it looks like a zoo in hell. Outside in the greenhouse, he explains that the creatures are mutations from being exposed to the radiation and that the large plants were also made large by exposure to radiation. As they look around, he takes a trowel and begins digging in the soil under a plant. He finds a dark glossy stone giving off heat. It is shown that all the plants have a stone buried with them, causing the growth. He wonders where the larger stone is that these were broken off from. He suggests the cellar. Susan remarks that her mother and Helga worked in the greenhouse.All at once a plant reaches out and envelopes Susan. She screams and Stephen comes to her rescue. She is surrounded by tendrils from the plant and Stephen finds a gardening tool to hack the plant away. He takes Susan to the door and kicks it open for them to escape.Back in the house, Stephen tells Susan to go upstairs while he searches the cellar. Meanwhile Witley is still calling to his wife through the door. Stephen opens a door to find a skeleton hanging from a wire. Upstairs, Susan finds her father asking what happened to her. She tells him they were in the greenhouse. He wants to know where Stephen is. He grabs her arm to twist it and she admits he is in the cellar. Witley takes off for the cellar.Fighting off bats, Stephen discovers the large cover containing the stone. The droning sound is heard. Witley approaches and demands that he leave. He tells Witley that the stone is destroying everyone and everything there. Suddenly a scream is heard from above. They race to see Susan.Stephen finds Susan on the floor and embraces her. Witley comes and asks if shes all right. Witley insists on finding Letitia and Stephen takes Susan away. They begin searching rooms as thunder and lightning are heard outside. One or more doors are blown open and flop about. Witley heads out calling his wife. The wind blows open a window and smashes a vase on a table as the curtains blow. They enter a large drawing room and close the windows. The wind blows the door shut and Stephen tells her its only the wind. They go to enter another room and a woman comes out, hideously deformed. They run downstairs with the hag following. They go into a large room and lock the door. The woman breaks through and attacks Stephen. He struggles with her and knocks her down. She gets back up and attacks him. He backs up against the glass doors and moves aside as she lunges. She falls through the doors. As Witley comes in and watches, the woman staggers forward and collapses. Her face is seen to melt, bleed and collapse. Witley tells Stephen to take Susan away.In the cemetery Witley tells Stephen that the evil of Corbin attacked his family. He tells of when the stone fell from heaven and glowed. Everyone came to see it but stayed away from the glowing. Stephen says it was a meteor and had nothing to do with Corbin or a curse. Witley says he took it into the house and cut it into smaller stones in the hopes of beautifying the countryside and raising great crops of food and flowers. He was hoping to restore honor to the name of Witley. Susan comes up and urges him to come back to the house. He tells them to go away. Susan insists she wont leave her father. Stephen tells her that nothing else can be done. She appeals to her father but he commands her to go away with Stephen.As they go to pack, Witley gets an axe and opens the lid to the stone. Inside the glowing and humming is heard. He hacks it with the ax and breaks it. Helga comes in with a knife to attack him. He recognizes her and tries to defend himself with the ax. She grabs it and comes forward. She strikes the stone with the ax and more flashes occur.Upstairs, they hear Witley cry out. Stephen tells her to stay there and he goes to investigate. The many satanic symbols and drawings on the walls are seen to glow. Witley lifts his head from over the stone and is seen to have a radioactive spot on his face. His face and hands show the radiation spreading rapidly. By the time Stephen arrives, there is no sign of Witley, except for the trail of glowing handprints on the walls. Stephen follows them and finally meets Witley, who is now glowing from his head and hands. He attacks and Stephen runs upstairs with Susan and they lock the door. Witley breaks through the door. Stephen tells Susan to wait over to the side until he tells her to run. Stephen hurls fireplace tools at Witley but he continues to attack. Stephen calls for Susan to run and she does. Witley begins to chase her. She hesitates by the top of the stairs and he breaks through the railing and falls to the floor below. There is an explosion and a fire breaks out. Susan almost falls below and Stephen lifts her back up. They go downstairs as the fire spreads to the house. The flames are so hot they have trouble getting out. Finally they find a door and flee the house.They look back at the burning house. She asks why did this have to happen? He says it didnt have to happen, but her father chose to use it to protect the Witley family instead of helping all people. He tells her to go. As the flames engulf the house, we see the image of Corbin, which seems to alter its expression.","

Blowing out the candle in his room, Stephen gets under the covers in bed and pretends to be asleep when Witley looks in on him. Coming alongside the bed, Witley reaches to grasp the candlestick, but a noise is heard as of something falling. Witley leaves the room and Stephen gets up and closes the door.Stephen goes out at first light onto the grounds. The black figure is seen and a shriek is heard. The figure attacks Stephen with a knife and he sees that the face is distorted and freakish. He escapes the attack and the figure leaves.Stephen goes into town and enters a phone booth but only looks in the phone book. Having located a doctor, he goes to the doctors house and is admitted. Dr. Henderson (Patrick Magee) comes in and begins drinking. He explains that he has been retired for some time. Stephen wants to know why everyone is afraid of the Witleys. Henderson refuses to talk about it and tells him to leave. On the way out, the woman Miss Bailey tells him that Corbin Witley died in Dr. Hendersons arms. There was no autopsy, no body, and no one saw him but Dr. Henderson. He was never the same after that and retired.Susan tries to get her mother to open the bedroom door, but there is no answer. Witley comes and sends her away. He tries to convince Letitia to open up. Inside we see that the room is in shambles, clothing strewn all around on the floor and furniture turned over.Susan and Stephen walk outside and he tells her about the glowing light inside the greenhouse. He says it resembled something he saw once in a radiation lab. He tells her that he saw Witley burying Merwyn last night. He also is sure that the black figure who attacked him was the maid Helga. He says the greenhouse is padlocked. They go there.Witley speaks to his wife through the door, telling her that he will take her to the doctor. She is seen cowering in the corner of the room, moaning. As she turns, we see that half of her face is deformed.Seeing that the greenhouse is locked up, Stephen asks if there is another way in. She is reluctant, but he convinces her it is important to find what is inside. She shows him how she used to get in the greenhouse through a side panel. They enter and see fantastic plants beyond their normal size. A strange droning sound is heard. They find many flowers and plants of unusual size. Then another shriek is heard. Susan says the back room used to be a potters shed. Stephen insists that they find out what is in the darkened room. She is afraid what her father will do, but Stephen convinces her that this is what is affecting her whole family and they will not leave until they understand everything. She agrees to come with him.Inside the room they find a glowing substance which he says is radioactive. Another shriek causes Stephen to shine a light where he sees a number of grotesque creatures in cages. He remarks  it looks like a zoo in hell. Outside in the greenhouse, he explains that the creatures are mutations from being exposed to the radiation and that the large plants were also made large by exposure to radiation. As they look around, he takes a trowel and begins digging in the soil under a plant. He finds a dark glossy stone giving off heat. It is shown that all the plants have a stone buried with them, causing the growth. He wonders where the larger stone is that these were broken off from. He suggests the cellar. Susan remarks that her mother and Helga worked in the greenhouse.All at once a plant reaches out and envelopes Susan. She screams and Stephen comes to her rescue. She is surrounded by tendrils from the plant and Stephen finds a gardening tool to hack the plant away. He takes Susan to the door and kicks it open for them to escape.Back in the house, Stephen tells Susan to go upstairs while he searches the cellar. Meanwhile Witley is still calling to his wife through the door. Stephen opens a door to find a skeleton hanging from a wire. Upstairs, Susan finds her father asking what happened to her. She tells him they were in the greenhouse. He wants to know where Stephen is. He grabs her arm to twist it and she admits he is in the cellar. Witley takes off for the cellar.Fighting off bats, Stephen discovers the large cover containing the stone. The droning sound is heard. Witley approaches and demands that he leave. He tells Witley that the stone is destroying everyone and everything there. Suddenly a scream is heard from above. They race to see Susan.Stephen finds Susan on the floor and embraces her. Witley comes and asks if shes all right. Witley insists on finding Letitia and Stephen takes Susan away. They begin searching rooms as thunder and lightning are heard outside. One or more doors are blown open and flop about. Witley heads out calling his wife. The wind blows open a window and smashes a vase on a table as the curtains blow. They enter a large drawing room and close the windows. The wind blows the door shut and Stephen tells her its only the wind. They go to enter another room and a woman comes out, hideously deformed. They run downstairs with the hag following. They go into a large room and lock the door. The woman breaks through and attacks Stephen. He struggles with her and knocks her down. She gets back up and attacks him. He backs up against the glass doors and moves aside as she lunges. She falls through the doors. As Witley comes in and watches, the woman staggers forward and collapses. Her face is seen to melt, bleed and collapse. Witley tells Stephen to take Susan away.In the cemetery Witley tells Stephen that the evil of Corbin attacked his family. He tells of when the stone fell from heaven and glowed. Everyone came to see it but stayed away from the glowing. Stephen says it was a meteor and had nothing to do with Corbin or a curse. Witley says he took it into the house and cut it into smaller stones in the hopes of beautifying the countryside and raising great crops of food and flowers. He was hoping to restore honor to the name of Witley. Susan comes up and urges him to come back to the house. He tells them to go away. Susan insists she wont leave her father. Stephen tells her that nothing else can be done. She appeals to her father but he commands her to go away with Stephen.As they go to pack, Witley gets an axe and opens the lid to the stone. Inside the glowing and humming is heard. He hacks it with the ax and breaks it. Helga comes in with a knife to attack him. He recognizes her and tries to defend himself with the ax. She grabs it and comes forward. She strikes the stone with the ax and more flashes occur.Upstairs, they hear Witley cry out. Stephen tells her to stay there and he goes to investigate. The many satanic symbols and drawings on the walls are seen to glow. Witley lifts his head from over the stone and is seen to have a radioactive spot on his face. His face and hands show the radiation spreading rapidly. By the time Stephen arrives, there is no sign of Witley, except for the trail of glowing handprints on the walls. Stephen follows them and finally meets Witley, who is now glowing from his head and hands. He attacks and Stephen runs upstairs with Susan and they lock the door. Witley breaks through the door. Stephen tells Susan to wait over to the side until he tells her to run. Stephen hurls fireplace tools at Witley but he continues to attack. Stephen calls for Susan to run and she does. Witley begins to chase her. She hesitates by the top of the stairs and he breaks through the railing and falls to the floor below. There is an explosion and a fire breaks out. Susan almost falls below and Stephen lifts her back up. They go downstairs as the fire spreads to the house. The flames are so hot they have trouble getting out. Finally they find a door and flee the house.They look back at the burning house. She asks why did this have to happen? He says it didnt have to happen, but her father chose to use it to protect the Witley family instead of helping all people. He tells her to go. As the flames engulf the house, we see the image of Corbin, which seems to alter its expression.

He drops it to the ground, saturates it with gasoline and sets it afire. Blood pours out of the canvas as it burns.Artist Adam Sorge stands before a blank canvas, paints it a bit, and angrily throws it aside. He selects another canvas, and places it on the easel, but is upset because he cannot get the right color. Gigi, Adam's live-in girlfriend and model, enters the room and Adam accidentally hits her with his paintbrush. Gigi tells Adam that he is due at the Farnsworth Galleries in one hour and critics will be there. Adam arrives at his showing where an art critic, named Gregorovich, is talking with Farnsworth. Gregorovich tells that due to his less-than-impressive use of color, he is an ""artist imposter"". Adam argues with the critic and leaves, passing Mrs. Carter who admires Adam's past work that is on display.The next day, Farnsworth goes to Adam's house to pick up a new painting. He tells Adam that he feels the same way as Gregorovich about Adam's use of color. Farnsworth takes another painting and leaves, and Adam beats a painting, leaving the broken frame on the floor. Adam and Gigi then spend some intimate time in the bedroom and afterwards, Gigi bends over to pick up the destroyed painting and cuts her finger on a nail. Adam later sees the smeared blood on the canvas and checks it outside with the other paintings. Gigi comes into the room and apologies about the blood, when Adam picks up a rough sketch of a woman and places it on the easel. He asks Gigi to open the wound and he cuts her finger with a razor and ""paints"" by smearing her blood on the canvas. Gigi pulls her finger away and tells him to use his own blood. Adam cuts all of his fingers and paints with his blood until he is weak and collapses on the couch.After resting for a while, Adam looks at his painting. Gigi talks about how he phoned Farnsworth and told him that he had something big, and she wonders where he is going to get the blood to finish the painting. Suddenly, Adam stabs Gigi in the face and uses her bloody head as a brush to finish the painting. Adam buries Gigi's body in the sand hear his house and the next day, he takes the finished painting to the gallery to show everyone. Gregotovich declares it Adam's ""finest."" Mrs. Carter is there and agrees to Farnsworth's high price of $15,000 to purchase the painting. But Adam tells them that the painting is not for sale. Gregotovich challenges Adam to paint another masterpiece and Adam agrees.Meanwhile, Mrs. Carter is talking with her daughter April, who is going on a picnic with her boyfriend Rolf, and two other friends, Jack and Sydney. At Adam's house, he prepares to cut his fingers again to paint a new painting, when he sees April and her friends on the beach near his house. Adam goes out to spy on them and wait to jump on them so he can kill them and use their blood, but he gets diverted when he sees another couple, named Norman and Betsy, nearby kissing each other on a beach towel. Betsy wants to ride two water bikes that are in the water near Adam's house. As they are doing so, Adam approaches them in a motorboat where he attacks and stabs Norman in the chest with a spear killing him as Betsy screams. Adam subdues her and takes her away. Later, Adam is seen painting a new canvas with blood. He goes in to the next room where the dead Betsy is tied to a wall with her intestines and innards hanging out of her stomach. Adam squeezes more blood out of the disemboweled girl and finishes his painting. He takes it the following day to the gallery and again refuses to sell it. Adam storms out of the gallery, and Gregorovich notes that the painting is still wet and that Adam forgot to varnish it.A few weeks later, Adam is beside himself in his house, more or less a recluse. Mrs. Carter is at her home also wondering why she hasn't heard from Adam for this whole time. April then goes out with Rolf and their two friends again for another beach party. Adam watches them from a distance. When April ventures near Adam's house, Adam takes a canvas outside and pretends to be painting. Adam tells the curious April that he is looking for a model and he asks her to pose. After he tells April his name, she tells him that her mother is Mrs. Carter who wants to buys some of his paintings. Adam tells April that if she poses for him, she can have the painting for free. April returns to her friends near the beach and tells them about meeting Adam and she will be going back later in the evening.That evening, Adam lets April into his house where she notes blood-like paint in his picture, and after she makes a joke about putting blood into the work, Adam explodes at her and says that the joke is not funny to him. April wants to leave, but Adam convinces her to stay, and has her stand on a small stepladder. In order to keep her hands still, Adam ties up April's wrists and restrains her.Meanwhile, Jack and Sydney go looking for some firewood for a fire they make on the beach. Sydney finds Gigi's badly decomposed, half-buried corpse and screams for Jack. They show the body to Rolf who runs towards Adam's house with a flashlight. In the house, Adam tells April to turn away from him for a few seconds and he will be done... as he lifts up a large axe to kill her. Rolf runs inside where he acts rudely towards Adam. Seeing the axe Adam has, Rolf grabs a nearby shotgun and points it at Adam keeping him at bay as he unties April. But Adam knocks the shotgun out of Rolf's hands and talks about how he ""immortalizes"" Gigi by keeping her alive in his painting and using peoples blood to ""immortalize"" them as well. When Jack and Sydney run into the house and momentarily distract Adam, Rolf grabs the shotgun. Adam lifts his axe to kill Rolf when he fires, hitting the deranged artist in the face. Adam stumbles and falls dead with his bloodied face on a blank canvas.The final scene picks up where the opening scene left off where Farnsworth is burning Adam's painting after it is made public about the insane artist using peoples blood for his paintings. Gregorovich arrives just as Farnsworth stands looking at the burning canvas where he tells the critic that he is burning Adam's ""funeral pyre"".","
    
                    An eccentric artist is panned by a well-known critic at his opening for not having a good color sense, so he starts a new series, using his own blood to paint. Soon he is weakened and must find other sources of blood to continue his paintings.

Gigi, Adam's live-in girlfriend and model, enters the room and Adam accidentally hits her with his paintbrush. Gigi tells Adam that he is due at the Farnsworth Galleries in one hour and critics will be there. Adam arrives at his showing where an art critic, named Gregorovich, is talking with Farnsworth. Gregorovich tells that due to his less-than-impressive use of color, he is an ""artist imposter"". Adam argues with the critic and leaves, passing Mrs. Carter who admires Adam's past work that is on display.The next day, Farnsworth goes to Adam's house to pick up a new painting. He tells Adam that he feels the same way as Gregorovich about Adam's use of color. Farnsworth takes another painting and leaves, and Adam beats a painting, leaving the broken frame on the floor. Adam and Gigi then spend some intimate time in the bedroom and afterwards, Gigi bends over to pick up the destroyed painting and cuts her finger on a nail. Adam later sees the smeared blood on the canvas and checks it outside with the other paintings. Gigi comes into the room and apologies about the blood, when Adam picks up a rough sketch of a woman and places it on the easel. He asks Gigi to open the wound and he cuts her finger with a razor and ""paints"" by smearing her blood on the canvas. Gigi pulls her finger away and tells him to use his own blood. Adam cuts all of his fingers and paints with his blood until he is weak and collapses on the couch.After resting for a while, Adam looks at his painting. Gigi talks about how he phoned Farnsworth and told him that he had something big, and she wonders where he is going to get the blood to finish the painting. Suddenly, Adam stabs Gigi in the face and uses her bloody head as a brush to finish the painting. Adam buries Gigi's body in the sand hear his house and the next day, he takes the finished painting to the gallery to show everyone. Gregotovich declares it Adam's ""finest."" Mrs. Carter is there and agrees to Farnsworth's high price of $15,000 to purchase the painting. But Adam tells them that the painting is not for sale. Gregotovich challenges Adam to paint another masterpiece and Adam agrees.Meanwhile, Mrs. Carter is talking with her daughter April, who is going on a picnic with her boyfriend Rolf, and two other friends, Jack and Sydney. At Adam's house, he prepares to cut his fingers again to paint a new painting, when he sees April and her friends on the beach near his house. Adam goes out to spy on them and wait to jump on them so he can kill them and use their blood, but he gets diverted when he sees another couple, named Norman and Betsy, nearby kissing each other on a beach towel. Betsy wants to ride two water bikes that are in the water near Adam's house. As they are doing so, Adam approaches them in a motorboat where he attacks and stabs Norman in the chest with a spear killing him as Betsy screams. Adam subdues her and takes her away. Later, Adam is seen painting a new canvas with blood. He goes in to the next room where the dead Betsy is tied to a wall with her intestines and innards hanging out of her stomach. Adam squeezes more blood out of the disemboweled girl and finishes his painting. He takes it the following day to the gallery and again refuses to sell it. Adam storms out of the gallery, and Gregorovich notes that the painting is still wet and that Adam forgot to varnish it.A few weeks later, Adam is beside himself in his house, more or less a recluse. Mrs. Carter is at her home also wondering why she hasn't heard from Adam for this whole time. April then goes out with Rolf and their two friends again for another beach party. Adam watches them from a distance. When April ventures near Adam's house, Adam takes a canvas outside and pretends to be painting. Adam tells the curious April that he is looking for a model and he asks her to pose. After he tells April his name, she tells him that her mother is Mrs. Carter who wants to buys some of his paintings. Adam tells April that if she poses for him, she can have the painting for free. April returns to her friends near the beach and tells them about meeting Adam and she will be going back later in the evening.That evening, Adam lets April into his house where she notes blood-like paint in his picture, and after she makes a joke about putting blood into the work, Adam explodes at her and says that the joke is not funny to him. April wants to leave, but Adam convinces her to stay, and has her stand on a small stepladder. In order to keep her hands still, Adam ties up April's wrists and restrains her.Meanwhile, Jack and Sydney go looking for some firewood for a fire they make on the beach. Sydney finds Gigi's badly decomposed, half-buried corpse and screams for Jack. They show the body to Rolf who runs towards Adam's house with a flashlight. In the house, Adam tells April to turn away from him for a few seconds and he will be done... as he lifts up a large axe to kill her. Rolf runs inside where he acts rudely towards Adam. Seeing the axe Adam has, Rolf grabs a nearby shotgun and points it at Adam keeping him at bay as he unties April. But Adam knocks the shotgun out of Rolf's hands and talks about how he ""immortalizes"" Gigi by keeping her alive in his painting and using peoples blood to ""immortalize"" them as well. When Jack and Sydney run into the house and momentarily distract Adam, Rolf grabs the shotgun. Adam lifts his axe to kill Rolf when he fires, hitting the deranged artist in the face. Adam stumbles and falls dead with his bloodied face on a blank canvas.The final scene picks up where the opening scene left off where Farnsworth is burning Adam's painting after it is made public about the insane artist using peoples blood for his paintings. Gregorovich arrives just as Farnsworth stands looking at the burning canvas where he tells the critic that he is burning Adam's ""funeral pyre"".
