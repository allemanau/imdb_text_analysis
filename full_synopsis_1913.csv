                    Princess Sonia Danidoff is staying at the Royal Palace Hotel, Paris, and withdraws $20,000 from the cashier's custody, placing the notes in a drawer in company with her magnificent rope of pearls. A few moments after a well-dressed stranger steps from behind the curtains and, with the coolest of sangfroid, steals the valuables in the very presence of the princess, and with a polite bow hands her his card and makes a dignified exit. Upon the card the name ""Fantomas"" slowly appears. The police are quickly upon the scene, but Fantomas, true to his nom de plume, has vanished. Inspector Robert Juve is the sleuth entrusted to track the mysterious marauder. But before Juve has time to move in the matter of the princess's jewels and cash, another escapade of Fantomas' is thrust upon him to investigate. Lord Beltham is missing. Juve calls on Lady Beltham, and in a man's hat finds the initial ""G."" With so slight a clue Juve tracks down ""Gurn"" (none other than the elusive Fantomas) to his lodgings and makes the ghastly discovery of Lord Beltham's dead body in one of ""Gurn's"" traveling trunks, and a packet of the special Fantomas cards establishes the connection between ""Gurn"" and Fantomas; they are one and the same man. Three months elapse. ""Gurn"" has been tried and condemned to die by the guillotine. Lady Beltham's name has not yet appeared in connection with the case, and the story goes that the murder was the outcome of a violent quarrel between ""Gurn"" and Beltham, yet she is enamored of the gentlemanly scoundrel and sets about seeking a method of escape for him. By means of liberal bribes, the aid of Warden Nibet is enlisted and he arranges an interview between the condemned man and Lady Beltham in a house overlooking the prison. That night a new play has been produced by a famous actor, Valgrand, who, acting the role of a condemned felon, adds a realistic touch by making up exactly to resemble ""Gurn."" At Lady Beltham's invitation, Valgrand, still made up as ""Gurn,"" visits her at 2 A.M., and partaking of drugged coffee, is rendered incapable of action. Warden Nibet returns and takes back his prisoner, no longer ""Gurn,"" alias Fantomas, but the unfortunate Valgrand, who goes through all the terrible preliminaries of a criminal's execution, aye, even to the point of being led to the guillotine, before inspector Juve makes the startling discovery that Fantomas has once more eluded him. Henceforth it is to be a fight between a clever, scheming, mysterious rogue on one hand, and inspector Juve, Chief of the Detective Dept. of Paris, on the other.

                    The story begins with Jean Valjean as a humble worker endeavoring to provide for his invalid mother. They live in a squalid home, made more wretched by his inability to provide sufficient food. He goes out in search of work, but is unsuccessful. Finally, in desperation, he steals a loaf of bread regardless of consequences. He hastens home with it, pursued by a crowd, and gives it to his mother. Valjean is arrested for the theft and sentenced to five years at hard labor. He with other convicts, is put in a stone quarry, and there makes his first acquaintance with Javert, a prison guard, who appears prominently throughout the story. The first notice Javert takes of Valjean is on account of his great strength in lifting a stone that no other prisoner can lift. In the prison dormitory word is whispered about that there is a chance for one man to escape, and among themselves the prisoners decide that they will draw lots to determine the one who shall make the break for liberty. The lot falls to Valjean, and with the aid of a small saw, he is soon in the open. The alarm is given and pursuit is begun, but Valjean eludes his pursuers. Javert is greatly vexed at the escape, for he is an automatic creature in doing his duty. He performs his duty like a machine, and his duty comes before everything else with him. Like a hunted animal, Valjean reaches the town of Digne, in southern France. He begs from door to door, but meets with many rebuffs, until one kind hearted woman directs him to the house of the parish priest, Myriel. The good priest takes him in, feeds him, and provides him with a cot for the night. In the night Valjean yields to temptation. He steals a pair of silver spoons, and departs. On the road he meets two ""gendarmes"" who take him back to the town, and before the priest. To his surprise Valjean is given a pair of silver candlesticks by the priest who dismisses the police, pretending that Valjean is an old acquaintance. Myriel then gives Valjean a letter to his brother, a manufacturer of glass beads in Montreuil. The action of the priest touches Valjean's heart and he repents bitterly of his wrongful act. He goes to Montreuil and is given a position by the priest's brother and is thenceforth known as ""Mr. Madeleine.""

                    The opening scene is in Elsinore, where a ghost is seen by the sentinels keeping guard on the battlements of the castle. This is related to Hamlet by his friend Horatio, who describes the spirit as much resembling the late King of Denmark, his deceased father, whom his Uncle Claudius is suspected to have murdered in order that the latter might usurp his throne. Uncle Claudius also married the queen, the mother of Hamlet, within a month after. Hamlet, moved by the narration of Horatio, determines to watch for the next appearance of the ghost. It is seen again at midnight, discloses itself to Hamlet as his murdered parent and relates to him the cruel circumstances of his cruel murder by the king, his uncle, and calls upon Hamlet to avenge it. In order to accomplish this purpose, Hamlet feigns madness, especially in his conduct towards Ophelia, daughter of Polonius, with whom he is enamored. Hamlet engages some players who enact a scene in the presence of the king and queen which displays the murder of his father, purposely to try the king. Claudius, on beholding this, stung by his conscious guilt and fearful of some outward event, determines to rid himself of his nephew by sending him to England. This project is aided by Hamlet, killing Polonius. whom he mistakes for the king and who was concealed behind the arras to listen to the conversation between the queen and her son, who had demanded an interview, Hamlet is by an accident made prisoner by some pirates as he is on his way to England but escapes and unexpectedly returns to Denmark. Previously, he discovers that the ambassadors are instructed by the king's letters to cause him to be put to death on his arrival in England. These letters he exchanges for others containing the same directions for the deaths of the ambassadors. During his absence, Ophelia, distracted through her father's death and her own misfortune, destroys herself, and her brother, Laertes, urged by false rumors concerning his father's demise, rebels against the king, but he abandons his intention on being told that Hamlet committed the deed. A stratagem is evolved by the king in which Laertes basely consents to kill Hamlet by secret means. Claudius wagers six Barbary horses against six French swords with Laertes that in a dozen passes he does not exceed Hamlet by three. Hamlet consents to make a trial and is first wounded by Laertes, who has treacherously used a poisoned weapon. In a scuffle they change swords and Laertes is himself wounded by the same deadly rapier. The king had prepared a poisoned chalice with which he determined to end Hamlet if Laertes failed. In the contents of this, the queen, unconscious that it is drugged, pledges Hamlet and is poisoned. Laertes, in the agony of death, confesses his own perfidy and accuses the king, and Hamlet, with the sword of Laertes, revenges himself by stabbing Claudius. The film concludes with the news of the death of Rosencrantz and Guilderstern through letters forged by Hamlet, and a eulogium oh the unfortunate prince by his friend Horatio and the choice of young Fortinbras for King of Denmark.

                    Bretton, furnished with credentials to Balkan officers, obtains a personal letter from the Minister of War, charging his subordinates to give the young newspaper man every assistance. On the train Bretton meets Clark, correspondent of a rival newspaper. While passing through the Customs, Clark catches sight of Bretton's letters of recommendation. Not having any himself, he resolves to steal them. The story jumps to the scene of warfare, where Sonia and her father are tending their sheep. The old man is killed by a stray bullet and is buried by his mourning daughter. The two correspondents proceed on foot to headquarters, and notice from the edge of a precipice a skirmish between the contending forces. In order to more clearly observe the fight, Bretton throws down his knapsack. Approaching too near the edge, he makes a false step and falls. His cries are heard by Sonia, who in going to his rescue risks her life. Clark cuts open his rival's knapsack and steals the coveted papers. Bearing these, he goes to headquarters, where he is warmly received. Bretton recovers from his fall and is somewhat smitten by his rescuer. Found by the soldiers, without credentials, he is arrested as a spy. He escapes from the guard tent and gallops away on a horse, untouched by the sentry's pursuing bullets. The battle is in progress and both correspondents have their stories ready. Clark, tricked by Sonia, is detained in his attempt to reach the telegraph office, and so Bretton's telegram goes through. When Clark finally arrives the wires are congested. Disgruntled, he visits a neighboring theater, but the enemy are within range and a well-directed shell crashes through the building and sends the audience and performers fleeing for their lives. Clark, among others, is rendered unconscious. Bretton, hearing of an impending battle on the sea, journeys there, and by climbing a tree sees the demolition of a majestic war vessel by a hidden mine. Again the correspondents hasten to the telegraph office, and Sonia, aiding Bretton, again foils Clark. Bretton, to obtain a better view of a land conflict, goes aloft in an aeroplane. It is shattered by a shell and falls earthward with a sickening crash. Sonia, who has been captured by the Turks after being wounded, has escaped from a hospital mosque and is wandering around when she sees the aeroplane descend. She saves Bretton from being burned to death. Again Bretton is triumphant in getting his story over the wires ahead of Clark. He asks Sonia to return home with him as his wife. The young people, on the conclusion of hostilities, arrive in Bretton's home town and are congratulated warmly on their work by the newspaper's proprietor. They meet Clark, their former enemy, and all differences are ended in a warm handshake and the declaration that ""all is fair in war and love.""

                    Claude Melnotte, an artist of lowly birth, is spurned by the proud Pauline, daughter of the wealthy Lyons merchant, Deschappelles. Beauseant, a rich gentleman who has been refused with levity by Pauline, plans to be revenged for the insult. He sees Claude Melnotte place a bouquet on the windowsill of Pauline's room. Pauline finds a note in the bouquet and when she discovers that her secret admirer is Claude Melnotte, the son of a gardener, she throws the flowers into the street. Beauseant follows Claude home, and persuades him to assume the fictitious title of ""Prince of Como"" for which purpose Beauseant furnishes money. Claude signs a contract, agreeing not to reveal his true identity until Beauseant gives him permission. Beauseant equips him with the valuable dress and trinkets of his supposed princely rank, introduces him to the leading society, and obtains for him an invitation to the home of the merchant Deschappelles. Pauline is enchanted with the Prince, and his rank and apparent wealth prove too much for her when Claude proposes marriage. She accepts him and the wedding takes place with great pomp and splendor. Meanwhile Claude has told his mother of his deception and has asked her to help him to comfort Pauline when she is disillusioned. He has to take Pauline to his mother's home as he has no other home for her. Pauline is heartbroken when she finds that she is the guest of a poor cottager instead of the mistress of a wonderful castle. Finding Pauline inconsolable Claude suggests that she divorce him, and having no hope in life left him, he enlists, goes to war, and Pauline returns to her father's home. He is promoted for bravery and returns two years later as Col. Melnotte. During Claude's absence Deschappelles has lost his money and Beauseant has come to the rescue, making the hand of Pauline his condition. Claude is just in time to prevent the marriage, and win Pauline for his own again. The scene closes with Pauline in the arms of Claude.
