                    Sir Robin of Locksley, defender of downtrodden Saxons, runs afoul of Norman authority and is forced to turn outlaw. With his band of Merry Men, he robs from the rich, gives to the poor and still has time to woo the lovely Maid Marian, and foil the cruel Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and keep the nefarious Prince John off the throne.

                    With King Richard the Lionhearted away fighting wars in the Holy Land, his brother Prince John seizes the Regency. The Normans are hard on the Saxon peasants, and when Prince John learns that Richard is being held for ransom in Vienna, he taxes them beyond all reasonable limits supposedly to pay for his release. Sir Robin of Locksley, a Saxon lord, rebels against the Prince and his principal henchman, Sir Guy of Gisbourne. Declared an outlaw, he takes up residence in Sherwood Forest and begins to surround himself with those who are loyal to King Richard: Little John, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and all the rest. When the Prince and Gisbourne manage to capture him by staging a archery contest, it's the beautiful Maid Marion who arranges his escape. When Robin and his men learn that Richard is in England, they protect him and ensure his evil brother is removed from power.

                    In the late twelfth century, King Richard the Lionhearted of England is fighting in the Holy Crusades, leaving the Regency of the Kingdom to his trusted friend, Longchamps. When Richard is captured by Leopold of Austria, Richard's brother, the treacherous Prince John, with help from his supportive Norman barons and his primary henchman Sir Guy of Gisbourne, seizes control of the Regency. Under the guise of getting money to free Richard, John, in pillaging from the Saxon commoners, uses the money instead to fatten his own coffers in gaining control of the throne. The Saxons turn to one of their own, Sir Robin of Locksley - also known as Robin Hood - who, often recklessly, fights on their behalf against Norman authority in an effort to restore what is rightfully the Saxons until Richard's return, Richard to who Robin is loyal. As such, Robin is viewed as an outlaw by Prince John and Sir Guy. Robin's refuge is Sherwood Forest, where he recruits men to fight for what he believes is right. Generally matching Robin's happy-go-lucky temperament, that band of merry men includes Will Scarlet, John Little (renamed Little John because of his hulking physical size), and Friar Tuck. Also seeing Robin and his men as outlaws is Lady Marian Fitzswalter, a Norman and a royal ward. It isn't until Marian meets Robin and sees first hand what he is doing that she changes her allegiances. Prince John and Sir Guy hope to use what they see as the growing attraction between Robin and Marian to capture Robin and sentence him to death. Robin and Marian, the latter she believes clandestinely, work against Prince John and Sir Guy until King Richard's return, when they hope all will be right with England. But the return of King Richard, if it does happen, does not automatically restore him to the throne, especially if Prince John can crown himself king in Richard's absence.

                    On Christmas Eve, an old miser named Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by the spirit of his former partner, Jacob Marley. The deceased partner was in his lifetime as mean and miserly as Scrooge is now and he warns him to change his ways or face the consequences in the afterlife. Scrooge dismisses the apparition but the first of the three ghosts, the Ghost of Christmas Past, visits as promised. Scrooge sees those events in his past life, both happy and sad, that forged his character. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, shows him how many currently celebrate Christmas. The Ghost of Christmas yet to Come shows him how he will be remembered once he is gone. To his delight, the spirits complete their visits in one night giving him the opportunity to mend his ways.

In the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed chained ghost of his former partner Jacob Marley, who died seven years ago and tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his happy childhood and coming of age; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family and the happiness of Fred and his fiancée Bessy; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and finds redemption changing thoughts about Christmas, Bob, tiny Tim, his nephew and people in general.

But the dessicated gent is about to get his comeuppance when he imagines he is visited by the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future.

Ebenezer Scrooge (Reginal Owen), is warned by Marley's ghost (Leo Carroll) on Christmas Eve that he must change his miserly ways or face damnation. He is told that he can expect visitations from 3 ghosts, to which Scrooge ""humbugs."" When the ghosts do come, he is shown his past, the present that he has made and the future, which includes his own death and that of Tiny Tim. Scrooge gets the message and changes his ways on Christmas Day and thus saves himself and Tiny Tim.

                    Mild mannered zoology professor Dr. David Huxley is excited by the news that an intercostal clavicle bone has been found to complete his brontosaurus skeleton, a project four years in the construction. He is equally excited about his imminent marriage to his assistant, the officious Alice Swallow, who is interested in him more for his work than for him as a person. David needs the $1 million endowment of wealthy dowager Mrs. Carleton Random to complete the project. Her lawyer, Alexander Peabody, will make the decision on her behalf, so David needs to get in his favor. However, whenever David tries to make a good impression on Peabody, the same young woman always seems to do something to make him look bad. She is the flighty heiress Susan Vance. The more David wants Susan to go away, the more Susan seems not to want or be able to. But David eventually learns that Alexander Peabody is her good friend, who she calls Boopy, and Susan's Aunt Elizabeth, with whom David has also made a bad impression without her knowing who he is, is Mrs. Carleton Random. However getting in Aunt Elizabeth and Boopy's good graces is not as easy as Susan smoothing the waters with them. Throw into the mix a tame pet leopard named Baby that Susan's brother Mark inexplicably sends her from Brazil, Aunt Elizabeth's big game hunting friend Major Horace Applegate, Aunt Elizabeth's pet terrier George who has a penchant for burying bones and other things, and a traveling circus passing through town and David may never be able to finish his project or make it to his wedding. But David may come to the realization that there is something more important in his life.

She sees their marriage only as a practical arrangement, and dismisses his thoughts of a honeymoon and of having children. The museum is vying for a one million dollar donation from Mrs. Carleton Random, and David is sent to a meeting with her lawyer, Mr. Peabody. There the introvert and impractical David bumps into the extrovert and energetic heiress Susan Vance. When a psychiatrist explains to Susan, that the love impulse in men often reveals itself in conflict, she interprets David's behavior as an example of this, and falls in love with him. From now on she has only one thought in her mind: to stop David from marrying his assistant, and to win him for herself. Without knowing how it happened, David suddenly finds himself with Susan in a car, transporting her tame leopard Baby to her aunt's farm in Connecticut. Susan's aunt Elizabeth turns up, and she happens to be the prospective donor David has been looking for. Suddenly David is entangled in a hodgepodge of misunderstandings and a nocturnal chase after animals on the run.

They all have a ""do whatever you want to do because you like doing it"" mentality, which was initially fostered by the family patriarch, Alice's maternal grandfather, Martin Vanderhof, in whose house they all live. With the exception of Alice, they are somewhat blissfully unaware that their lives are unconventional. However, their attitude of openness and inclusion has reaped them the rewards of a multitude of unconditional friends, some who live with them solely because they came one day, liked what they saw, were welcomed with open arms, and have never left. Tony and Alice want to deal with the incompatibility issue head on, although they both take differing paths in how to deal with it. Another problem is that A.P. Kirby is working on the biggest deal of his career - cornering the munitions market, especially lucrative in the lead up to probable war - that requires a massive land acquisition, which includes Grandpa Vanderhof's house, he who refuses to sell. Grandpa is unaware of who wants to buy his house, while A.P. is unaware that Grandpa is the one hold out who could ruin his entire plan.

                    Anthony P Kirby is a wealthy banker. In order to clinch his next deal his company, Kirby and Company, is buying up all the properties in a neighbourhood. Everyone has sold, except one. Martin Vanderhof won't budge, not for any offer. He is happy where he is, living with his daughter, son-in-law, two granddaughters, grandson-in-law and a few other people in a community largely free of life's pressures. Mr Kirby's son, Tony, is a new-appointed Vice President of Kirby and Company and is in love with his secretary, Alice Sycamore, Mr Vanderhof's granddaughter. Their relationship, and the property issue, puts the two families, the Kirbys and Vanderhofs, on a collision course. It's more than a clash of families but a clash of outlooks, ideals and what's important in life.

"6","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030341/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In a fictional country in a highly mountainous region of Europe, a motley group of travelers is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her. In the compartment are other passengers who appear not to understand English.Iris and Miss Froy strike up a conversation. They leave the compartment together to go to the dining car for tea. On route to the dining car, Miss Froy stumbles into the compartment of the English couple the Todhunters and proffers her excuses. In the dining car, the pair are seated by a waiter and Miss Froy provides a supply of her own tea, Harriman's Herbal Tea. While in the dining car, Miss Froy writes her name in the dust of the window after Iris mishears it as Freud when the noise of another train drowns out their conversation. During tea, Miss Froy annoys the two English gentlemen returning to England for the test match by asking for their sugar cubes, which are being used to illustrate a cricket match. Miss Froy tells Iris about her job as a children's governess and music teacher. They reserve two places for the first sitting of lunch. After returning to the compartment, encouraged by Miss Froy, Iris drops off into a heavy nap.When she reawakens, the governess has vanished. Iris is shocked when the other passengers in the compartment, the Baroness (Mary Clare), and a grinning Italian (Philip Leaver), claim ""the English lady"" never existed. Even the other English travelers deny ever seeing her, for their own reasons: the Todhunters for fear of drawing attention to their affair, and the cricket fans Caldicott and Charters because they are worried about missing the cricket Test match if confirming the disappearance causes delays.A reknowned ""brain specialist"" on the train, Dr. Egon Hartz (Paul Lukas), suggests that Miss Froy never existed: Iris was bumped on the head before boarding, and the conversation may have only taken place in her mind. Dr. Hartz, declares that she must be hallucinating due to her accident. However, Iris is certain that something more sinister is going on and continues to investigate,.As she searches the second class carriages looking for Miss Froy, Iris meets Gilbert. Their earlier interactions back at the hotel had not been good, but he believes she is sincerely distressed and offers to help. Since the train had not stopped anywhere during her nap, Iris is convinced Miss Froy is somewhere in the train.At the first stop the train picks up a heavily bandaged brain tumor patient, carried on a gurney (a patient of Dr. Hartz) who is being transported to a hospital for surgery. Iris watches carefully on one side of the train, Gilbert on the other, and they see no one get off the train.After the train starts off again, Gilbert and Iris question all the people who should have seen Miss Froy, but they draw a blank until Mrs. Todhunter comes forward to say she has seen Miss Froy. She hopes that having her name made public will trigger a scandal, which would result in divorces for herself and her paramour. After this, the Italian from Iris's compartment appears and says that Miss Froy has returned. Iris and Gilbert return to the compartment to find someone dressed like Miss Froy seated there, however when her face is seen it is not Miss Froy. This lady is Madame Kummer (Josephine Wilson). The Baroness says she did not equate Iris's English nanny with this German lady. Gilbert announces that he can dispel the confusion as there is someone else on the train who has seen Miss Froy/Madame Kummer. Unfortunately while this has been going on, Mrs. Todhunter has told her lover what she has done. Mr. Todhunter says that while her husband would divorce her, his wife will never divorce him. With this in her mind, Mrs. Todhunter now identifies Madame Kummer as the same woman she saw wearing oatmeal tweeds early on.Feeling dejected, Iris takes Gilbert to the dining car. Gilbert tells Iris bits about his life. During this conversation, Iris notices Miss Froy's name fingered on the dust of the window just as they enter a tunnel. By the time they come out into the open, the name has disappeared. Iris becomes annoyed and frustrated at Gilbert's disbelief as she tells him about the Harriman's Herbal Tea package. Iris storms out of the dining car and pulls the emergency cord in desperation.After the train has restarted, and under the threat of being put off the train at the next stop, Iris returns to her compartment alone. Meanwhile, some rubbish has been thrown out of the dining car and a gaudy tea label for Harriman's Herbal sticks briefly to the window in front of Gilbert. This is enough to make him believe Iris and he rushes back to her. They embrace in the corridor. After this, they search the train and end up in the baggage car, where they find the broken glasses of Miss Froy among items that identify the Italian as ""The Great Doppo,"" a professional magician on tour, adept at making people disappear. The magician appears and he takes the glasses from Gilbert. A struggle ensues, and the magician even draws a switchblade. But with some help from Iris, they knock the magician unconscious and put him in a trunk, and tie a rope around it. Unbeknownst to them, the trunk is a magician's trick trunk and the Italian makes his escape.After this, they head off to tell all of this to the one person they think they can trust, Dr Hartz. They open the door of his compartment but he is not there, only the heavily bandaged patient and the nun nurse.Iris notices that the nun with the patient is wearing high heels, which means she is in disguise. Iris surmises that Miss Froy was lured to the baggage car and held captive. Madame Kummer, who wasn't seen boarding the train, must have come aboard disguised as the patient, dressed in clothes like Miss Froy's, with Miss Froy becoming the bandaged patient. Dr. Hartz returns and tells them to wait in the next compartment while he orders the nun to arrange for drinks to be drugged, as one waiter is an accomplice. He takes them to the dining car, and urges them to drink the brandies he has ordered to calm their nerves. When they return to the compartment, he tells them the patient is Miss Froy and she will be taken off the train at the next station. She will be taken to a hospital, where he will perform an operation from which she will not recover. He also tells them that the drinks they have just had have been drugged. Iris and Gilbert then seem to go to sleep due to the drug.Dr. Hartz leaves the compartment to get ready to get off at the next station. But the drug hasn't taken full effect yet, and Gilbert and Iris have heard that they can fight this particular drug's drowsiness by a lot of physical activity. Gilbert climbs out of the window and into the compartment where the nun and Miss Froy are. The nun speaks perfect English and tells Gilbert that she was hired to play a part but is unwilling to help in a murder. They unwrap Miss Froy from her constraining bandages. At this point Madame Kummer enters, so they bandage her up in Miss Froy's place against her will. Gilbert and Miss Froy return to the next compartment and pretend to be still asleep because of the drug.At the following stop, Dr Hartz, the patient, and the Baroness leave the train and board a waiting ambulance. With the train still at the station, the identity of the patient is discovered. Dr Hartz arranges for a station worker to uncouple the rear cars, so when the engine starts off again, only the first class car and the dining car are pulled out and they are diverted away from the border. After the train pulls off, pleased that they will soon be over an international border, Gilbert notices that the back of the train has been uncoupled and goes back to tell the others. They agree that there is only the carriage they are in and the dining car between them and the engine but that there wouldn't be anyone there right now. Gilbert points out that it is teatime so all the English people will be there. The three of them go to the dining car. At first no one believes that the train has been uncoupled. Just as they confirm this, the train stops in a wood, and they see cars waiting, uniformed people in them. Dr. Hartz and the Baroness (she is wife to the Minister of Propaganda) are seen with the cars.A military officer approaches the train and politely tells the English group to get off the train so they can be escorted to safety. The nun warns Gilbert of a trap and he clobbers the officer with a chair, and he falls unconscious. Charters thinks this is very rash, and says he is going to go out to apologize and ""put things right."" But a dining car steward has already told the officials of the attack. The Baroness gives an order and one of the soldiers shoots Charters in the hand. Gilbert takes the officer's revolver, and challenges the approaching officials. Mr. Todhunter also has a pistol. Gilbert and Caldicott (who Charters says is ""a damn good shot"") start firing, in response to attacking shots. Mr. Todhunter goes outside waiving a white handkerchief in truce and is shot by the attackers. While this is going on, Miss Froy reveals to Iris and Gilbert that she is taking a message: a tune to take to a Mr. Callender at the Foreign Office. Gilbert promises that he can memorize Miss Froy's tune quickly because of his musical training. Miss Froy leaves and is seen in the distance dropping behind a rise after a shot is fired towards her.When they run out of ammunition, Gilbert decides that they need to get the train started, head back to the junction, switch the points, and get across the border. He and Caldicott head to the engine while Charters will, at the right moment, jump down and switch the points. They force the engine crew to start the train and head back to the junction. Both crew are shot by the soldiers, but luckily Gilbert once ""ran a miniature engine on the Dymchurch line."" The unconscious officer has recovered, and is holding the passengers at gunpoint, but the nun manages to sneak out to change the points. After she throws the switch, and is scooped up by Gilbert in the nick of time, she is shot in the leg by Dr. Hartz, who has pursued them in one of the cars from the woods.On arrival at Victoria station, London, they all go their separate ways. Sadly for Caldicott and Charters, the Test match has been abandoned due to flooding. On seeing her fiancé coming to greet her, Iris hides in a cab, pulls Gilbert in with her, and says she wants to marry Gilbert instead. They continue on to the Foreign Office. On arriving there, in the excitement of their feelings for each other, Gilbert has forgotten the tune. After a few unsuccessful attempts to refresh his memory they hear the tune being played on a piano, and walk into the next room to see Miss Froy playing it. It is the same tune the balladeer strangled at the hotel had been playing. Iris and Gilbert approach Miss Froy. She looks up to see them both, and grasps their hands joyfully.","
    
                    Passengers on a scheduled train out of the mountainous European country of Mandrika are delayed by a day due to an avalanche, and thus get up close and personal with each other out of necessity in the only and what becomes an overcrowded inn in the area. Once the train departs, the one person who it is uncertain is on the train is a middle aged English governess named Miss Froy. Iris Henderson, who was vacationing in Mandrika with girlfriends before heading back to England to get married, is certain that Miss Froy was on the train as they were in the same compartment and they had tea together in the dining car, but all those people who can corroborate her story don't seem to want to do so. Iris' thoughts are easily dismissed as a possible concussion as Iris was hit over the head just before boarding the train. Iris will take anyone's help in finding Miss Froy, even that of an Englishman named Gilbert, a musicologist with whom she had a not so pleasant encounter at the inn the evening before. As Iris and Gilbert go on their quest throughout the train, they believe there is a conspiracy among many of the passengers against the validity of there being a Miss Froy. But if there is a conspiracy, Iris and Gilbert still have to find Miss Froy and find out why anyone would want to kidnap a middle aged English governess.

The Baroness gives an order and one of the soldiers shoots Charters in the hand. Gilbert takes the officer's revolver, and challenges the approaching officials. Mr. Todhunter also has a pistol. Gilbert and Caldicott (who Charters says is ""a damn good shot"") start firing, in response to attacking shots. Mr. Todhunter goes outside waiving a white handkerchief in truce and is shot by the attackers. While this is going on, Miss Froy reveals to Iris and Gilbert that she is taking a message: a tune to take to a Mr. Callender at the Foreign Office. Gilbert promises that he can memorize Miss Froy's tune quickly because of his musical training. Miss Froy leaves and is seen in the distance dropping behind a rise after a shot is fired towards her.When they run out of ammunition, Gilbert decides that they need to get the train started, head back to the junction, switch the points, and get across the border. He and Caldicott head to the engine while Charters will, at the right moment, jump down and switch the points. They force the engine crew to start the train and head back to the junction. Both crew are shot by the soldiers, but luckily Gilbert once ""ran a miniature engine on the Dymchurch line."" The unconscious officer has recovered, and is holding the passengers at gunpoint, but the nun manages to sneak out to change the points. After she throws the switch, and is scooped up by Gilbert in the nick of time, she is shot in the leg by Dr. Hartz, who has pursued them in one of the cars from the woods.On arrival at Victoria station, London, they all go their separate ways. Sadly for Caldicott and Charters, the Test match has been abandoned due to flooding. On seeing her fiancé coming to greet her, Iris hides in a cab, pulls Gilbert in with her, and says she wants to marry Gilbert instead. They continue on to the Foreign Office. On arriving there, in the excitement of their feelings for each other, Gilbert has forgotten the tune. After a few unsuccessful attempts to refresh his memory they hear the tune being played on a piano, and walk into the next room to see Miss Froy playing it. It is the same tune the balladeer strangled at the hotel had been playing. Iris and Gilbert approach Miss Froy. She looks up to see them both, and grasps their hands joyfully.

                    Set in antebellum New Orleans during the early 1850's, this film follows Julie Marsden through her quest for social redemption on her own terms. Julie is a beautiful and free spirited, rapacious Southern belle who is sure of herself and controlling of her fiancé Preston Dillard, a successful young banker. Julie's sensitive but domineering personality--she does not want so much to hurt as to assert her independence--forces a wedge between Preston and herself. To win him back, she plays North against South amid a deadly epidemic of yellow fever which claims a surprising victim.

For them to get married, they will have to work hard to get the blessing of Julia's father, Edward Seton, who ultimately does give his approval, as he sees in Johnny what Julia sees: a man with potential.

It was also an issue in the comic-strip for about a year after its inception when it was basically a continuity strip but, aside from Dagwood's inability to coax a pay-raise from Mr. Dithers over the years, the financial status of the family was seldom an issue when the format switched to a gag-a-day strip.

                    When a death row prisoner tells him he wouldn't have led a life of crime if only he had had one friend as a child, Father Edward Flanagan decides to do something about. An advocate of child rights and an opponent of the severe approach to juvenile delinquency at the time, Flanagan genuinely believed that there is no such thing as a bad boy. Starting with just a few boys in a rented house, Father Flanagan eventually establishes Boys Town on 200 acres of land 10 miles outside of Omaha, Nebraska. Much of the film focuses on Flanagan's attempts to influence one boy, Whitey Marsh, who will become a hoodlum if he doesn't change his ways. When Whitey is implicated in a bank robbery, it puts all of Boys Town at risk. Throughout it all Flanagan has to fight prejudice in those who believe delinquents should just be locked up and the never ending shortage of money to accomplish his goals.

He burgles the homes of four high society acquaintances, stealing high-end jewelry in order to gauge his own physiological reactions to the experience, which he finds exhilarating. On his fourth robbery he crosses paths with professional thieves and seeks out their leaders, Jo Keller, a woman fence, and Rocks Madison, a vicious sociopath. They form an unholy alliance: Clitterhouse masterminds the high-end robberies, which greatly increases the gang's take, while the Runtonesque thieves allow themselves to have their blood and vital signs monitored. Keller's growing attraction to Clitterhouse and the loyalty the gang shows him feeds Rock's growing resentment at being displaced, and his growing paranoia pushes him to try to commit the greatest crime of all, homicide.

After quitting his initial job in Wales as an assistant to Dr. Page due to the unfair working conditions set by Dr. Page's tyrannical wife, Manson gets a job working as the doctor for the local mine. Quickly, Manson notices that many of the miners have a persistent cough which had been treated by the previous doctor with ""pink medicine"". Suspecting that the cough has something to do with the mining conditions, Manson decides to investigate. Without the support of the local hospital, Manson, with the urging and support of his equally idealistic schoolteacher wife, Christine, opens a research facility in their home. Their research does determine that the silica dust from the mine is causing the miners' tuberculosis. However, many of the miners and the miner's board question the need for the research and want Manson to go back to solely prescribing the pink medicine for the cough. Disillusioned, Manson hastily quits and opens a practice in London. After an initial struggle, Manson, with advice from an old colleague, learns that a lucrative career can be had by treating the wealthy whose only medical problems are the want for attention. Money changes Manson's outlook, an outlook not supported by Christine. But a personal tragedy close to the Mansons caused by medical incompetence makes Manson reexamine the path he's chosen in London.

                    Pepe Le Moko, a thief who escaped from France with a fortune in jewels, has for two years lived in, and virtually ruled, the mazelike, impenetrable Casbah, ""native quarter"" of Algiers. A French official insists that he be captured, but sly Inspector Slimane knows he need only bide his time. The suave Pepe increasingly regards his stronghold as also his prison, especially when he meets beautiful Parisian visitor Gaby, who reminds him of the boulevards to which he dare not return...and arouses the mad jealousy of Ines, his Algerian mistress.

                    Philanthropist Paul Lorenz is one of the more public faces in the fight against behavior that spreads the many ""social diseases"", such as syphilis and gonorrhea. An example of such behavior is going to or performing in burlesque shows, which promotes casual sex. Indeed, many in the audience at one burlesque show in New York have only sex on their mind, including young unmarried couple James and Jane, office colleagues Peggy and Betty (Peggy who is trying to seduce Betty), and Paul Lorenz's son himself, Tom Lorenz, who is looking forward to an after show group sex party, which will include some of the girls from the show, such as Sheila Wayne, who has syphilis but treats it as casually as her sex. One of the show girls who won't be attending the party is Millicent Hamilton. From a small town, good girl Millicent's pre-engagement to her boyfriend Wendel Hope was interrupted when she won a beauty contest with a trip to New York. She found life in New York more difficult than she expected and a sexual encounter associated with trying to advance her show business career resulted in her also contracting syphilis. But Millicent is going to respected Dr. Hampton, who informs her that she can fully recover and eventually marry Wendel if she takes the slow, intensive but proven therapy. But when she leaves New York for home which means therapy with another doctor, Dr. Hampton warns her to beware of quacks who may promise a full, expensive miracle cure. When Millicent heads home, will she heed Dr. Hampton's advice, or will she fall prey to the hope of a quick cure so that she can marry Wendel sooner?

The young airmen go up in bullet-riddled ""crates"" and the casualty rate is appalling, but Brand can't make the ""brass hats"" at headquarters see reason. Insubordinate air ace Captain Courtney is another thorn in Brand's side...but finds the smile wiped from his face when he rises to command the squadron himself.

Veterans Courtney and Scott have survived many near misses and shake their head in despair at the arrival of new replacement pilots, some with only a few hours of flying experience. Most don't survive their first sortie and Courtney for one chides their commanding officer, Major Brand, for sending them to their death. When Brand is promoted however, it's Courtney who is put in charge of the squadron and he soon finds himself making the same difficult decisions Brand faced. When Scott's younger brother arrives fresh-faced from flight school, Courtney orders the lad out on patrol over Scott's objections. The young man's death drives a wedge between them. When Scott volunteers for what will inevitably be a suicide mission, Courtney decides to take on the mission himself.

                    Margaret Garret - Maggie to her friends - is a Broadway star, just starting the run of her latest show, ""Glamour"". She comes from a humble background and worked her way up the ranks. She now supports her family - her parents Dennis and Minerva Garret, her sister Salina Pine and Salina's family of her husband Bert Pine and their precocious infant twin daughters, Betsy and Dotsy Pine - who all live with Maggie in her home. Dennis and Minerva believe they gave up their own performing careers to support Maggie in hers, while Salina, also an aspiring stage performer and Maggie's understudy for Glamour, believes she would have long become a star if it wasn't for Maggie trying to suppress her. Bert, a strongman who just spends his days working out, makes no effort to get a job. Maggie does whatever required to make this and any show she's in a success, largely in what she feels is her obligation to support her family. Despite long being told by her faithful personal secretary Harrison, Maggie finally truly understands through a newspaper story that despite a $10,000 a week contract for Glamour, she is penniless, but she refuses to understand it's all because of her family living the high life off her back. As such, she believes she has to work even harder to support them, from learning new songs and lines overnight on the wants of the writer and director, to keeping her throngs of adoring fans happy by always signing autographs. She meets one of those fans, Dan Webster, when he tries to help her through a crush of fans, his move which she takes as being that of a masher, which leads to him taking a trip to the police station under arrest. Nonetheless, Dan still loves Maggie, who he considers an angel. Through similar subsequent incidents, Dan is eventually able to ingratiate himself legally into Maggie's life. Dan, from a wealthy background, now owns a cargo ship and sails the world on a whim all in an effort to find the joy in life, such joy which he feels Maggie doesn't have. As they spend more and more time together, Dan tries to show Maggie how truly to have fun. Even if Maggie does find that joy of living through Dan, nothing will truly change in her life until she sees her family for the true lazy sponges that they actually are, and which Harrison has tried to convince her of for most of her career.

He also inherits, by way of his doorstep, an unwanted baby girl, Jean Johnson, whom he adopts into his family, rears and loves as his own. Practicing his profession for pigs, I.O.U.s and a lot of empty promises as payment, he is barely able to provide for his family, yet is successful ultimately. Dr. Abbott is dedicated to the welfare of his community and well-being of his patients (mostly lower class working folks of the rural town), but must battle a group of miserly businessmen at every twist and turn. He encounters resistance by the local bureaucracy for every progressive idea or beneficial proposal, made for the betterment of the community, yet his altruistic optimism is not hampered by the penny-pinching bureaucrats interested more in lining their own pockets, rather than helping the town and its struggling population.

                    Sisters Louise Elliott, Helen Elliott and Grace Elliott - the daughters of pharmacist Ned Elliott and his wife Rose Elliott - are considered the most attractive and desirable young women in 1904 Silver Bow, Montana. The eldest Louise is the smart, practical one who is pre-engaged to stuffy Tom Knivel, middle daughter Helen is the one who wants excitement in her life regardless of love, and youngest Grace is the naive one. Louise's practicality is why it is somewhat of a surprise when she immediately falls in love with newspaper sportswriter and aspiring novelist Frank Medlin, marries him and runs off with him to his home base of San Francisco. Long pursuing him, Helen marries wealthy older Sam Johnson, who she doesn't love, but who can provide the exciting lifestyle she wants. And Grace, nursing his broken heart, marries Tom. As each sister endures the problems in her marriage - Louise's whose becomes the most obvious as Frank drowns whatever his problems in life in a bottle of booze, and as Louise is in San Francisco on the fateful date of April 18, 1906 - the other two, and their parents, ultimately want to be there to help if they can.

                    In 1898 Cuba, U.S. troops who have survived the Spanish-American War are now dying by the hundreds from disease -- yellow fever, known as ""yellow jack."" Major Walter Reed, an Army physician, struggles to find the cause of the infection and to overcome governmental interference. When an answer seems at last possible, Reed decides that the only way to test the theory is to expose his own men to the disease. He cannot order men to undergo the test. Yet finding volunteers seems impossible. Without them, though, yellow jack will perhaps kill millions.

                    A young-stiff-upper-lipped British officer, Robert Rogers writes a book about a white tiger and sacrifices of native girls by the Sakai tribe in Malaya. But the critics ridicule the book. Since the book was based on stories Robert's father had told him, there isn't anything Robert can do but trek off to Malaya (after freshening up in Singapore) and prove his old daddy had given him the straight scoop. Especially since the London Explorer's Society had removed the elder Roberts' plaque from its hallowed walls. (Back off...nobody claimed it was going to be ""Four Feathers."") Some credibility is lost when, warming up before going after the white tiger, Roberts lassos a Saladang which is advertised as being the most feared animal in the world. Evidently, this Saladang doesn't know his reputation and just reacts to getting roped as calmly as your-everyday water buffalo chewing on his cud. But later on Roberts is captured by a fierce tribe of natives, gets clawed by a tiger, rescues Mamo Clark from being sacrificed, and has several encounters with pythons, who appear to not be an endangered species as they are hanging from every tree limb in Malaya. Jayne Regan provides the romantic interest as the---what else when British officers are concerned---Colonel's daughter. And, ere long or about an hour, Roberts returns and makes the scoffing club members put his father's plaque back upon their stuffy

Lieutenant Brent and his police officers think she's taken it too far when she reports having found a dead body in the empty house of wealthy Charles and Sheila Lane, with no body in sight when they arrive. Things get worse for Melsa when newspaper editor Peter Ames writes a scathing editorial about her scandalous behavior. The problem is is that Melsa really did see a dead body in the house, she going into the house only when she saw an acquaintance, Ronnie Beldon, mysteriously rush out of the empty house in the middle of the night. Melsa and her friends want to show Brent and Ames that she wasn't crying wolf by locating the dead body themselves. When both Charles Lane and Ronnie Beldon's dead bodies materialize - Lane's the one which Melsa originally saw in the house - Melsa and her friends believe she's been vindicated. But they continue to try and find out on their own who the killer is as Melsa is a suspect, they don't trust Brent's skills, and Melsa seems to be in danger for knowing too much. By this time, Ames also insinuates himself into the investigation as he has fallen in love with Melsa, who doesn't fully trust him as he may only be trying to get an exclusive story.

                    Lee Sheridan's ego has always been stoked by his newspaper publisher father, Dan Sheridan, who is willing to ""hold the presses"" solely to print Lee's many sporting accomplishments as they happen. Because he is as good as he says in those sporting accomplishments, Lee is generally well liked by his colleagues at Lakedale State College in his hometown of Lakedale despite that ego. It is because of those sporting feats that Lee is offered a scholarship to attend Oxford. Lee expects to be as welcomed at Oxford as he has been his entire life, but is slow to learn that his brash American sensibilities mean more to his staid Oxford classmates than his sporting accomplishments, that brashness which turns off the first three Oxford students he meets on the train. It is because of their rough treatment of him, especially by Paul Beaumont, that makes Lee reconsider his stay in England. Lee does decide to stay and make a name for himself in a good way, partly to impress Molly Beaumont, Paul's pretty sister. Although Molly can see Lee for the nice guy that he is beyond that brash veneer, Lee may have to work harder to impress his male classmates beyond his sporting prowess, despite he helping the track and rowing teams specifically. Lee and Paul may come to a new understanding based on their personal situations, Paul's which includes a personal relationship with Elsa Craddock, a married bookstore owner.

The girls support each other however they can, but each is an individual with her own distinct personality and wants, including the type of man each wants as a husband. Practical but deep in her heart romantic Emma has long been courted by their next door neighbor, unassuming florist Ernest Talbot, and clever Thea wants to be Mrs. Ben Crowley, he a wealthy up and coming banker with prospects. Only the youngest, the fun loving Ann, states that she doesn't want to get married. Their collective lives change with the entry into their lives of two men. The first is Adam's old friend's son, popular music composer and conductor Felix Deitz, who easily gets a job at the foundation using his natural and sincere charm which he applies to all equally. Many women misconstrue that charm for romantic interest. The second is Felix's acquaintance, musician Mickey Borden, who he hires to orchestrate his latest composition. Mickey has a chip on his shoulders about what life has dealt him, which he uses in turn as a reason for living a reckless life. The two men make each of the four daughters reexamine what she thinks she wants in life, or more precisely who she wants, which for all may be the same person.

                    In 1845 Vienna, Johann Strauss II - Schani to his friends - would rather write and perform waltzes than anything else, this at a time when a waltz is not considered proper society music. After he is fired from his clerical bank job because of his preoccupation with composing, he decides to follow his passion and form an orchestra. After some famed opera singers, including Carla Donner, hear his music, they expose Schani's music to the masses, to royalty and to music publisher Julius Hofbauer. As such, Schani becomes the toast of Vienna. With his new found musical fame, Schani's life, which includes his work in the European Revolutions, changes. He becomes torn for his love for his loving and faithful wife Poldi Vogelhuber and his more emotionally passionate but somewhat destructive love for Carla Donner, who herself is involved with Count Anton Hohenfried.

                    Bad blood exists between Bill Steele and Frankie Stanton, the leading contenders for the heavyweight title, and a grudge match is scheduled. Steele's knockout victory is tainted by his opponent's untimely death, ostensibly from a concussion caused by hitting the canvas. A post-mortem reveals that poison was somehow introduced into a cut above Stanton's eye although it is unclear how and why. Gambling might seem to be the motive as several of the principle suspects, gamblers Clipper McCoy and Nick Crowder, Stanton's shady manager Jerry Connors, and fight promoter Philip Benton, all seemed to have made wagers on the fight. Benton's spoiled daughter and female reporter Penny Kendall are vying for the affections of Steele, who is now slated to fight for the championship against pugnacious Biff Moran. Lt. Riggs of New York Homicide and Moto, who were spectators at the fight, go on the trail of the murderer following the autopsy results. Moto's prime suspect is a shadowy character named John Howard, who collected on huge bets in four different Midwestrern cities after the Stanton fight. Discovering his real identity will be a key to Moto's TKO of the killer.

The one person who Jean believes could convince Pat not to shut it down and to resurrect it is the newspaper's former editor-in-chief, Robert Lansing, who Pat previously fired. Bob owns his own PR firm and is out to get the account of John P. Dillingwell, one of the wealthiest men in America but also the most hated and who has a penchant for miniature trains and sicking his attack dogs on people he doesn't like. He is hated because Bob secretly led a smear campaign against Dillingwell when he was editor-in-chief all in the name of Dillingwell figuring he needed a good PR person. In trying to get Dillingwell's business, Bob goes after Dillingwell's granddaughter, Lorri Dillingwell, who happens to be Pat's fiancée. The secret identity of a H. Louis Brown adds another layer of complexity into the proceedings. As each of Bob, Jean, Pat and Lorri do whatever they need to get what they want professionally, their personal lives also mesh, with it never too clear which boy is with which girl and if any boy will end up with any girl.
