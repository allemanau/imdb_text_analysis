                    It's the early twentieth century. In Argentina, Frenchman Marcelo Desnoyers and German Karl von Hartrott are the two sons-in-law of well-off Argentine farm owner Don Julio Madariaga, Desnoyers the favored one. Within this family collective, there is a special bond between Madariaga and one of his grandsons, Julio Desnoyers, who, like his maternal grandfather in his day, is a ladies man. Out of circumstance, the Desnoyers and the von Hartrotts move to their respective fatherlands of France and Germany following Madariaga's death. In France, Julio leads a rather carefree and irresponsible life, making a living as an artist and a tango instructor, the meager income from which is supplemented by money from his mother on the sly for him to be able to maintain the lavish life to which he is accustomed. That lavish life, through his ""work"", includes casual relationships with multiple women. Julio's view of life changes when he and Marguerite Laurier fall in love, Julio who has no interest in any other woman anymore. The issue is that Marguerite is already married, she who is not nor has ever been in love with her older husband in an arranged marriage, Etienne Laurier. Beyond the issue of Marguerite being a married woman, the murder of Archduke Ferdinand leading to the onset of the Great War affects what happens not only between Julio and Marguerite but also within this entire collective. The war complicates the family unit as the Desnoyers and the von Hartrotts are on opposing sides of the conflict, patriotism in this case which may trump blood seeing as to the nature of their time together in Argentina. And while Marcelo sees himself as being patriotic to the cause of France, Julio may not feel the same for his adopted home, he who may focus more on his own personal situation of wanting to be with Marguerite.

                    The unwed Mother (Purviance) leaves a charity hospital with her newborn child, disconsolately passes a church wedding, and leaves her baby in a limousine with a note. But car thieves hijack the limo and dump the baby in the garbage where he is discovered by a Tramp (Chaplin). The Tramp rescues the infant and takes him along to raise him. Five years pass. The Mother has become an opera star and does charity work in the hope of relocating her son. The Tramp has raised the kid to work a scam in tandem: the boy breaks windows by tossing rocks, and the tramp shows up immediately and offers to repair them for a fee. A doctor tips off the Mother, who has the authorities pick up the child, but the Tramp steals him back and a chase ensues. This was Chaplin's first six-reel feature; he had to hold it hostage to get the studio to pay him the 1-1/2 million he was entitled to when they tried to pay him for only a two-reeler. A 12-year-old girl named Lillita McMurray appears briefly in the film as a flirtatious angel; three years later she would become pregnant by the writer-director, and marry him at age 16.

She is in Biskra, Algeria where she plans on embarking on a month long trip into the desert by herself with only a guide. In Biskra, a tribal leader, western educated Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan, becomes enthralled with the vision of Lady Diana. With the assistance of her guide, Sheik Ahmed is able to abduct Lady Diana as she embarks on her desert tour. The Sheik brings her to his desert oasis compound, where he is sure she will ultimately fall in love with him as he has with her. Lady Diana is not used to taking orders from anyone, let alone someone who has abducted her, especially as his orders make her feel humiliated, such as wearing Arab garb, and being treated as a subservient Arab woman especially in front of a visiting ""western"" friend from Paris, Raoul de Saint Hubert. As the Sheik begins to know Lady Diana and upon consultation with Raoul, he begins to trust her to act and be herself without his rules. Slowly, Lady Diana does begin to fall in love with Sheik Ahmed. But acknowledgment of her true feelings may come too late as a rival sheik name Omair may have his own designs on Diana.

In his idleness, he has a sense of entitlement, and who he feels entitled to marry is a young woman within his social circle, she in turn receiving several offers of marriage a day. Her businessman father refuses to allow the marriage because of Harold's idleness demonstrating his laziness. So Harold decides not so much to apply but rather just insinuate himself into a job posted on a sidewalk sandwich board: to join the navy. When he changes his mind to do something more fun - to join his girl, her father and her friends on a sailing trip around the world - he learns it's too late to back out of his three year navy enlistment. Despite a rocky start, Harold is able to earn the friendship and respect of the other sailors, even O'Rafferty, the roughest, toughest sailor on his ship, although Harold doesn't get close to achieving an officer's rank as he dreams. But his actions in the Kingdom of Khairpura-Bhandanna, where he has a shore leave, may show his girl and her father, the Kingdom where they are coincidentally docked at the same time, that he truly is worthy of her hand.

She is willing, but her father, a hardworking steel magnate, disapproves and tells the boy to get a job and prove he can do something other than loaf. The boy takes the first job he sees by joining the Navy, not realizing that it's a job that he can't quit. Although he dreams of being an admiral, he's just a lowly sailor who passes the time swabbing the decks and getting into trouble with the ship's tough guy. Meanwhile, father and daughter take a long trip on their yacht and arrive at the same Indian port as the Navy ship. After other misadventures during shore leave, the boy must try to rescue the girl when she's kidnapped by the local Rajah.

                    Jackie Blair's father was killed in France. His mother died traveling in steerage. This leaves little Jackie Blair alone when he appears at Ellis Island, and the immigration officials want to send him right back. Captain Bill appears on the scene asking for a job - but he's too old and no one wants him. He sees lonely little Jackie, pities him and asks the eight Pinkosuwitz children to include him in their games. Thus, the Captain unwittingly engineers Jackie's escape. The orphan is mixed in with the Pinkosuwitzes when they leave the immigration building. When they find they've gained a ninth child, they send him on his way. This leaves Jackie to follow Captain Bill back to his very modest home - for which the old salt is unable to pay the rent. Jackie tries to make himself useful. He even sings and dances with an organ grinder to make money for the Captain's medicine. Little does either guess that Jackie's wealthy grandmother has everyone in immigration looking for the boy. When Jackie turns up at the matron's party for unfortunate children, he may be reunited with her. Or he may go to jail when he's suspected of stealing her hand-bag.

                    Danish silent movie-star Asta Nielsen formed her own production company to make this film, in which new elements are combined with features (and a few lines) familiar from Shakespeare's version of the legend. The most important of these changes sees Hamlet made into a female character - a princess forced to masquerade as a man by her scheming mother; from this follows Hamlet's secret passion for Horatio and rivalry with Ophelia for his love. Queen Gertrude is here presented as conspiring in her first husband's murder, and the old king's ghost does not appear - young Hamlet merely hears a voice from the tomb and (apparently) dreams of him. In addition, Hamlet now kills Claudius (in a fire) immediately upon returning from Norway with an army led by old school- friend Fortinbras, and it falls to Gertrude to engineer Hamlet's death in the fencing match as well as kill herself by accidentally drinking the poisoned wine.

                    In Belgium in 1903, widowed Madame Bodamere is remarried to a rich American, who insists that she leave her young daughter Jeanne behind with the child's nurse Marie. Several years later, the mother comes back to reclaim her child, but Marie, not wanting to give up Jeanne, tells the mother that the child is dead. When Belgium is invaded in 1914, Marie fears for Jeanne's safety and sends her, now a teenager, to America along with a letter to Jeanne's mother confessing Marie's deception. On the trip, Jeanne picks up two young Belgian orphans and takes them with her. Jeanne finds her mother living on a large estate, and is repeatedly denied the chance to explain who she is. She ends up taking a job as a maid in her mother's mansion, and claiming the two orphans as her own. Meanwhile, her mother grows increasingly despondent, and her marriage soon stands on shaky ground.

                    Wlliam deMille produced and directed Miss Lulu Bett, a film of extraordinary conviction and insight. It was then often the custom for unmarried women to lodge with family; thus we discover Miss Lulu in a boring Midwestern town, an exploited household drudge for her sister and her overbearing brother-in-law. In the course of the story (based upon the Pulitzer Prize play and novel by Zona Gale), Lulu evolves from slavery into an attractive and self-assured woman, prepared to make her own life. Revealed through wonderful performances and clever use of props, the characters are extraordinarily solid and involving.
