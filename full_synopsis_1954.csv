As a successful photographer, he's known for taking difficult pictures no one else can get, including the one of an out-of-control race car which smashed his camera and broke his leg an instant after it was snapped. Jeffries lives in a small apartment, and spends his time in a wheelchair looking out the rear window into the courtyard of the building; he can also see into the lives of all his neighbors, catching glimpses of their daily routines. It's the sort of thing only an invalid might do, watching them eat, clean, sleep and argue. There's the girl who exercises in her underwear, the married couple who sleep on their small balcony to beat the heat, the struggling songwriter working at his piano; and there's the salesman who lives across the courtyard from Jeffries, the one with the nagging bedridden wife. They seem to fight all too often.Every day a therapist comes to visit Jeff, dispensing her mature wisdom and berating him for sitting there all day spying on his neighbors. Stella (Thelma Ritter) tells him she can smell trouble coming. He should get his mind off his neighbors and think about marrying that beautiful girlfriend of his. Jeff replies that he's not ready for marriage. Sure, she's a wonderful girl, but she's also a rich, successful socialite, and Jeff lives the life of a war correspondent, always on the go, usually living out his suitcase and often in an unpleasant environment. It's not the life he wants to offer her. ""Well"" says Stella, ""that girl is packed with love for you right down to her fingertips.""""That Girl"" arrives shortly after Stella leaves. Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) breezes in wearing a stunning satin dress, looking every inch the beautiful socialite she is, and obviously very much in love with Jeff. They have dinner, but soon enough the conversation turns to the future, and they quarrel. Jeff sees no way they can reconcile their different lifestyles, and she walks to the door, telling him goodbye. ""When will I see you again?"" asks Jeffries.""Not for a long time,"" she replies sadly. ""At least, not until tomorrow night.""The night drags by, and it's too hot for Jeffries to sleep. It starts to rain. He dozes in his wheelchair by the window, but notices activity across the yard. The salesman goes out carrying his heavy silver sample case, and Jeffries looks at his watch: it's 2:00am. The blinds in the bedroom are drawn, so Jeffries can't see the wife. Later, the salesman returns, lifting the case easily, as if it were empty. Twice more he goes out in the rain in the middle of the night, lugging the heavy case, but coming home with it lighter. Intrigued, Jeffries wonders what the salesman is doing, but he finally dozes off around daybreak.Discussing the incident with Stella, and then later with Lisa, they all begin to watch the salesman. With the blinds now open, they can see that the wife is gone. Jeffries pulls out his binoculars, and then a large telephoto lens to get a better look. They watch as he goes into the kitchen and cleans a large knife and saw. Later, he ties a large packing crate with heavy rope, and has moving men come and haul the crate away. Stella runs around the front of the building to catch the name of the moving company, but misses the truck. By now they're all thinking the same thing; there's foul play going on, and the missing wife has been murdered by the salesman. They check his name on the front of the building: Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr).Jeffries calls in an old Army buddy - Thomas J. Doyle (Wendell Corey) who's now a detective, and explains the situation to him. Naturally he doesn't believe a word of it, and tells Jeffries to stick to photography. After further checking, the detective finds that Mrs. Thorwald is in the country, has sent a postcard to her husband, and the packing crate they had seen was full of her clothes. Chastened, they all admit to being a little ghoulish, even disappointed when they find out there wasn't a murder after all. Jeffries and Lisa settle down for an evening alone, but soon a scream pierces the courtyard. One of the neighbors had a little dog they would let roam around the yard, and now it's dead with it's neck is broken. It had been digging in Thorwald's small flower garden. All of the neighbors rush to their windows to see what's happened, except for one. Jeffries notices that Thorwald sits unmoving in his dark apartment, with only the tip of his cigarette glowing.Shortly after the dog is found dead, Jeff notices a change in Thorwald's small flower garden in the courtyard: using a slide he'd taken about two weeks before he discovers that the zinnia that the dog had been digging around is now a few inches shorter. Jeff suspects that Thorwald had buried something there & had dug it up after murdering the dog. Convinced that Thorwald is guilty after all, they slip a letter under his door asking ""What have you done with her?"" and then watch his reaction. Lisa delivers the note and slips away before Thorwald can find her. When she returns to the apartment, excited, Jeff has a look of excitement on his face as well, realizing that Lisa is a courageous woman who likely could accompany him in his adventurous life.Calling Thorwald's apartment, Jeffries tells Thorwald to meet him at a bar down the street, as a pretext to getting him out of the apartment. When Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella grab a shovel and start digging, but after a few minutes, they find nothing.Refusing to give up, Lisa climbs the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and squeezes in an open window, much to Jeffries' alarm. Rummaging around the apartment, Lisa finds Mrs. Thorwald's purse and wedding ring, things she surely would never have left behind on a trip. She holds them up for Jeffries to see, but he can only watch in terror as Thorwald comes back up the stairs to the apartment. Lisa is trapped.Calling the police as Thorwald goes in, he and Stella watch helplessly as Lisa tries to hide, but is found by Thorwald moments later. They see her try to talk her way out, but Thorwald grabs and begins to assault her. Terrified by their helplessness, they can only watch as he turns out the lights and listen as Lisa screams for help. The police arrive and beat on Thorwald's door, saving Lisa just in time.Jeffries watches from across the courtyard as the police question Lisa, then arrest her. Her back is to him, and he see her hands behind her back pointing to Mrs. Thorwald's ring, which is now on her finger. Thorwald sees this as well, and realizing that she's signaling to someone across the way, looks up directly at Jeffries with murderous understanding.Pulling back into the dark, Jeffries calls his detective friend, who agrees to help get Lisa out of jail, and is now convinced that Thorwald is guilty of something. Stella takes all the cash they have for bail and heads for the police station. Jeffries is left alone, and looking back over to Thorwald's apartment, he sees all the lights are off. Down below, he hears the door to his own building slam shut, then slow footsteps begin climbing the stairs. Thorwald is coming for him, and he's trapped in his wheelchair.Looking for a weapon, he can find only the flash for his camera. He grabs a box of flashbulbs, and under his door he watches the hall lights go off. Footsteps stop outside his door, then it slowly opens. Thorwald stands in the dark looking at Jeffries. ""Who are you?"" he says heavily. ""What do you want from me?"" Jeffries doesn't answer, but as Thorwald comes for him he sets off the flash, blinding Thorwald for a few seconds.He is slowed but not stopped, and Jeffries keeps setting off flashbulbs in Thorwald's face, but he finally fumbles his way to Jeffries' wheelchair, then grabs him and pushes him towards the open window. Fighting to stay alive, Jeffries cannot stop Thorwald, and is pushed out. Hanging onto the ledge, yelling for help, he sees Lisa, the detective and the police all rush in. Thorwald is pulled back, but it's too late; Jeffries slips and falls just as the police run up beneath him. Luckily, they break his fall, and Lisa sweeps him up in her arms. Thorwald confesses to the murder of his wife, and the police take him away.A few days later the heat has lifted. The camera pans across the other apartments, and there is an amusing end-tale for each one. Jeffries sleeps peacefully in his wheelchair, now with two broken legs from the fall. Lisa reclines happily next to him, now wearing blue jeans and a simple blouse, and reading a camping book. She smiles at him as he sleeps, but pulls out a hidden fashion magazine from under the cushion.","

With only the occasional distraction of a visiting nurse and his frustrated love interest, a beautiful fashion consultant, his attention is naturally drawn to the courtyard outside his ""rear window"" and the occupants of the apartment buildings which surround it. Soon he is consumed by the private dramas of his neighbors lives which play themselves out before his eyes. There is ""Miss Lonelyhearts,"" so desperate for her imaginary lover that she sits him a plate at the dinner table and feigns their ensuing chat. There is the frustrated composer banging on his piano, the sunbathing sculptress, the shapely dancer, the newlyweds who are concealed from their neighbors by a window shade, and a bungling middle-aged couple with a little yapping dog who sleep on the fire escape to avoid the sweltering heat of their apartment. ...And then there is the mysterious salesman whose nagging, invalid wife's sudden absence from the scene ominously coincides with middle-of-the-night forays into the dark, sleeping city with his sample case. Where did she go? What's in the trunk that the salesman ships away? What's he been doing with the knives and the saw that he cleans at the kitchen sink?

The bandit chief recognizes they have ransacked this village before, and decides it is best that they spare it until the barley is harvested in several months. One of the villagers happens to overhear the discussion. When he returns home with the ominous news, the despairing villagers are divided about whether to surrender their harvest or fight back against the bandits. In turmoil, they go to the village elder, who declares that they should fight, by hiring samurai to help defend the village. Some of the villagers are troubled by this suggestion, knowing that samurai are expensive to enlist and known to lust after young farm women, but realize they have no choice. Recognizing that the impoverished villagers have nothing to offer any prospective samurai except food, the village elder tells them to ""find hungry samurai.""The men go into the city, but initially are unsuccessful, being turned away by every samurai they ask sometimes rudely because they cannot offer pay other than three meals a day. Just as all seems lost, they happen to witness an aging samurai, Kambei, execute a cunning and dramatic rescue of a young boy taken hostage by a thief. As Kambei walks towards town a young samurai, Katsushir, asks to become his acolyte. Kambei insists that he walk with him as a friend. Then the farmers ask Kambei to help defend their village; to their great joy, he accepts. Kambei, with Katsushir's assistance, then recruits four more masterless samurai (rnin) from the city, one by one, each with distinctive skills and personality traits. Although Kambei had initially decided that seven samurai would be necessary, he plans to leave for the village with only the four that he has chosen because time is running short. The villagers beg him to take Katsushir also and, with some prodding by the others, he agrees. A clownish ersatz samurai named Kikuchiyo, whom Kambei had rejected for the mission, follows them to the village at a distance, ignoring their protestations and attempts to drive him away.When the samurai arrive at the village, the villagers cower in their homes in fear, hoping to protect their daughters and themselves from these supposedly dangerous warriors. The samurai are insulted not to be greeted warmly, considering that they have offered to defend the village for almost no reward, and seek an explanation from the village elder. Suddenly, an alarm is raised; the villagers, fearing that the bandits have returned, rush from their hiding places begging to be defended by the newly-arrived samurai. It turns out that Kikuchiyo, until this point merely a tag-along, has raised a false alarm. He rebukes the panicked villagers for running to the samurai for aid after first failing to welcome them to the village. It is here that Kikuchiyo demonstrates that there exists a certain intelligence behind his boorish demeanour. The six samurai symbolically accept him as belonging with them, truly completing the group of wanderers as the ""seven samurai.""As they prepare for the siege, the villagers and their hired warriors slowly come to trust each other. However, when the samurai discover that the villagers have murdered and robbed fleeing samurai in the past, they are shocked and angry, and Kyz, the most professional and calm of the samurai, even comments that he would like to kill everyone in the village. The always clownish Kikuchiyo passionately castigates the other samurai for ignoring the hardships that the farmers face in order to survive and make a living despite the intimidation and harassment from the warrior class, in the process revealing his origins to Kambei, who suddenly perceives that Kikuchiyo is himself a farmer's son. ""But who made them like this?"" he asks. ""You did!"" The anger the samurai had felt turns to shame, and when the village elder, alerted by the clamor that this revelation instigates, asks if anything is the matter, Kambei humbly responds that there is not. The samurai continue their preparations without any animosity, and soon afterward show compassion toward the farmers when they share their rice with an old woman who, her family having been killed by bandits, cries out that she merely wants to die.The preparations for the defense of the village continue apace, including the construction of fortifications and the training of the farmers for battle. Katsushir, the youngest samurai, begins a love affair with Shino, the daughter of one of the villagers. Shino had been forced to masquerade as a boy by her father who hoped the deception would protect her from the supposedly lustful samurai warriors.As the time for the raid approaches, two bandit scouts are killed, and one is captured and reveals the location of the bandit camp. Three of the samurai, along with a guide from the village, decide to carry out a pre-emptive strike. Many bandits are killed, but one of the samurai, Heihachi, suffers a fatal sword wound when his villager friend lost emotion control upon seeing his imprisoned wife commit suicide. When the bandits arrive in force soon after this raid, they are confounded by the fortifications put in place by the samurai, and several are killed attempting to scale the barricades or cross moats. However, the bandits have a superior number of trained fighters, and possess three muskets, and are thus able to hold their own. Kyz decides to conduct a raid on his own to retrieve one of the muskets and returns with one several hours later. Kikuchiyo, jealous of the praise and respect Kyz earns, particularly from Katsushir, later abandons his post to retrieve another musket, leaving his contingent of farmers in charge. Although he succeeds, the bandits attack the post, overwhelming and killing many of the farmers. Kambei is forced to provide reinforcements from the main post to drive the bandits out, leaving it undermanned when the bandit leader charges this position. Although they are driven off, Gorobei is shot and killed and it is revealed that Yohei, Kikuchiyo's friend, was killed at his post.Apart from defense, the initial strategy of the samurai is to allow the bandits to enter a gap in the fortifications one at a time through the use of a closing ""wall"" of spears, and to then kill the lone enemy. This is repeated several times with success, although more than one bandit manages to enter the village several times. On the second night, Kambei decides that the villagers will soon become too exhausted to fight and instructs them to prepare for a final, decisive battle. During the night, Katsushir's affair is revealed, and after an initial uproar, his amorous adventures provide comic relief to the embattled militia.When morning breaks and the bandits make their attack, Kambei orders his forces to allow all 13 remaining bandits in at once. In the ensuing confrontation, most of the bandits are easily killed, but the leader takes refuge in a hut unseen. In what is portrayed as dishonorable act, he shoots Kyz in the back from the safety of the hut, killing him. A despondent Katsushir seeks to avenge his hero, but an enraged Kikuchiyo bravely (and blindly) charges ahead of him, only to be shot in the belly himself. Although mortally wounded, Kikuchiyo ensures he kills the bandit chief, finally proving his worth as a samurai, before dying. Dazed and exhausted, Kambei and Shichirji sadly observe ""we've survived once again,"" while Katsushir wails over his fallen comrades. The battle is ultimately won for the villagers.The three surviving samurai, Kambei, Katsushir, and Shichirji, are left to observe the villagers happily planting the next rice crop. The samurai reflect on the relationship between the warrior and farming classes: though they have won the battle for the farmers, they have lost their friends with little to show for it. ""Again we are defeated,"" Kambei muses. ""The farmers have won. Not us."" This melancholic observation sheds new light on Kambei's statement at the beginning of the film that he had ""never won a battle."" This contrasts with the singing and joy of the villagers, whose figuratively life-sustaining work has prevailed over war and left all warriors as the defeated party.","
    
                    A veteran samurai, who has fallen on hard times, answers a village's request for protection from bandits. He gathers 6 other samurai to help him, and they teach the townspeople how to defend themselves, and they supply the samurai with three small meals a day. The film culminates in a giant battle when 40 bandits attack the village.

                    In the Sixteenth Century, in Japan, a poor village is frequently looted by armed bandits losing their crop of rice.

    Synopsis
    &#12302;&#19971;&#20154;&#12398;&#20365;&#12303;A gang of marauding bandits approaches a mountain village. The bandit chief recognizes they have ransacked this village before, and decides it is best that they spare it until the barley is harvested in several months. One of the villagers happens to overhear the discussion. When he returns home with the ominous news, the despairing villagers are divided about whether to surrender their harvest or fight back against the bandits. In turmoil, they go to the village elder, who declares that they should fight, by hiring samurai to help defend the village. Some of the villagers are troubled by this suggestion, knowing that samurai are expensive to enlist and known to lust after young farm women, but realize they have no choice. Recognizing that the impoverished villagers have nothing to offer any prospective samurai except food, the village elder tells them to ""find hungry samurai.""The men go into the city, but initially are unsuccessful, being turned away by every samurai they ask sometimes rudely because they cannot offer pay other than three meals a day. Just as all seems lost, they happen to witness an aging samurai, Kambei, execute a cunning and dramatic rescue of a young boy taken hostage by a thief. As Kambei walks towards town a young samurai, Katsushir, asks to become his acolyte. Kambei insists that he walk with him as a friend. Then the farmers ask Kambei to help defend their village; to their great joy, he accepts. Kambei, with Katsushir's assistance, then recruits four more masterless samurai (rnin) from the city, one by one, each with distinctive skills and personality traits. Although Kambei had initially decided that seven samurai would be necessary, he plans to leave for the village with only the four that he has chosen because time is running short. The villagers beg him to take Katsushir also and, with some prodding by the others, he agrees. A clownish ersatz samurai named Kikuchiyo, whom Kambei had rejected for the mission, follows them to the village at a distance, ignoring their protestations and attempts to drive him away.When the samurai arrive at the village, the villagers cower in their homes in fear, hoping to protect their daughters and themselves from these supposedly dangerous warriors. The samurai are insulted not to be greeted warmly, considering that they have offered to defend the village for almost no reward, and seek an explanation from the village elder. Suddenly, an alarm is raised; the villagers, fearing that the bandits have returned, rush from their hiding places begging to be defended by the newly-arrived samurai. It turns out that Kikuchiyo, until this point merely a tag-along, has raised a false alarm. He rebukes the panicked villagers for running to the samurai for aid after first failing to welcome them to the village. It is here that Kikuchiyo demonstrates that there exists a certain intelligence behind his boorish demeanour. The six samurai symbolically accept him as belonging with them, truly completing the group of wanderers as the ""seven samurai.""As they prepare for the siege, the villagers and their hired warriors slowly come to trust each other. However, when the samurai discover that the villagers have murdered and robbed fleeing samurai in the past, they are shocked and angry, and Kyz, the most professional and calm of the samurai, even comments that he would like to kill everyone in the village. The always clownish Kikuchiyo passionately castigates the other samurai for ignoring the hardships that the farmers face in order to survive and make a living despite the intimidation and harassment from the warrior class, in the process revealing his origins to Kambei, who suddenly perceives that Kikuchiyo is himself a farmer's son. ""But who made them like this?"" he asks. ""You did!"" The anger the samurai had felt turns to shame, and when the village elder, alerted by the clamor that this revelation instigates, asks if anything is the matter, Kambei humbly responds that there is not. The samurai continue their preparations without any animosity, and soon afterward show compassion toward the farmers when they share their rice with an old woman who, her family having been killed by bandits, cries out that she merely wants to die.The preparations for the defense of the village continue apace, including the construction of fortifications and the training of the farmers for battle. Katsushir, the youngest samurai, begins a love affair with Shino, the daughter of one of the villagers. Shino had been forced to masquerade as a boy by her father who hoped the deception would protect her from the supposedly lustful samurai warriors.As the time for the raid approaches, two bandit scouts are killed, and one is captured and reveals the location of the bandit camp. Three of the samurai, along with a guide from the village, decide to carry out a pre-emptive strike. Many bandits are killed, but one of the samurai, Heihachi, suffers a fatal sword wound when his villager friend lost emotion control upon seeing his imprisoned wife commit suicide. When the bandits arrive in force soon after this raid, they are confounded by the fortifications put in place by the samurai, and several are killed attempting to scale the barricades or cross moats. However, the bandits have a superior number of trained fighters, and possess three muskets, and are thus able to hold their own. Kyz decides to conduct a raid on his own to retrieve one of the muskets and returns with one several hours later. Kikuchiyo, jealous of the praise and respect Kyz earns, particularly from Katsushir, later abandons his post to retrieve another musket, leaving his contingent of farmers in charge. Although he succeeds, the bandits attack the post, overwhelming and killing many of the farmers. Kambei is forced to provide reinforcements from the main post to drive the bandits out, leaving it undermanned when the bandit leader charges this position. Although they are driven off, Gorobei is shot and killed and it is revealed that Yohei, Kikuchiyo's friend, was killed at his post.Apart from defense, the initial strategy of the samurai is to allow the bandits to enter a gap in the fortifications one at a time through the use of a closing ""wall"" of spears, and to then kill the lone enemy. This is repeated several times with success, although more than one bandit manages to enter the village several times. On the second night, Kambei decides that the villagers will soon become too exhausted to fight and instructs them to prepare for a final, decisive battle. During the night, Katsushir's affair is revealed, and after an initial uproar, his amorous adventures provide comic relief to the embattled militia.When morning breaks and the bandits make their attack, Kambei orders his forces to allow all 13 remaining bandits in at once. In the ensuing confrontation, most of the bandits are easily killed, but the leader takes refuge in a hut unseen. In what is portrayed as dishonorable act, he shoots Kyz in the back from the safety of the hut, killing him. A despondent Katsushir seeks to avenge his hero, but an enraged Kikuchiyo bravely (and blindly) charges ahead of him, only to be shot in the belly himself. Although mortally wounded, Kikuchiyo ensures he kills the bandit chief, finally proving his worth as a samurai, before dying. Dazed and exhausted, Kambei and Shichirji sadly observe ""we've survived once again,"" while Katsushir wails over his fallen comrades. The battle is ultimately won for the villagers.The three surviving samurai, Kambei, Katsushir, and Shichirji, are left to observe the villagers happily planting the next rice crop. The samurai reflect on the relationship between the warrior and farming classes: though they have won the battle for the farmers, they have lost their friends with little to show for it. ""Again we are defeated,"" Kambei muses. ""The farmers have won. Not us."" This melancholic observation sheds new light on Kambei's statement at the beginning of the film that he had ""never won a battle."" This contrasts with the singing and joy of the villagers, whose figuratively life-sustaining work has prevailed over war and left all warriors as the defeated party.

Hidden from view, a claw, similar to the one found in the fossil, rears out onto a river bank, then slides back into the water.At the institute Dr David Reed (Richard Carlson) meets Maia, who seems surprised to find Reed in Brazil. Reed explains they're researching lung fish. The rest of the conversation centers around Maia remembering when Reed was a student.Maia asks Reed about why he never married Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams) He explains she's never been able to talk him into it. Maia then shows Reed a photo of the fossil he found and believes it is hundreds of million years old. Reed immediately takes an interest and wants to go back up river to recover the rest of the fossil.At the institute discussions occur about the meaning of the fossil, it is generally agreed it was an amphibian and probably very strong. Dr Williams (Richard Denning) agrees the fossil is a major find, and as one of the directors gives the go ahead for a larger expedition to go back up river and dig the rest of it out.Back at the campsite it is night and the workers are preparing to settle down for the night. One sees a creature enter the tents and kills both occupants.Sometime later the expedition is making its way upstream on the Rita, a battered motor vessel with little comfort. Captain Lucas (Nestor Paiva) explains how deadly and large all the life around the Amazon River is. The boat docks and the crew quickly discover the campsite has been destroyed and the men are dead. They consider it could have been a jaguar..Despite the situation the crew clean up the camp and work begins retrieving the fossil. After eight days no fossil remains are found. Reed figures that perhaps the fossil had been washed away from the river bank, and the remains might be located further downstream in a lagoon, The Black Lagoon. Capt Lucas explains that many people have gone to the lagoon over the years, but none have come back.Reed and Kay have a romantic moment as the boat is moved. They discuss their plans to marry and settle down together. The boat pushes towards the lagoon, it is a very tight fit through a section of the river, but it soon opens up to the lagoon. Reed Reed and Williams break out the aqua-lungs to dive the lagoon and investigate the local life forms. The men successfully complete their mission not realizing they are being stalked by the creature. Williams is jealous of the attention Kay is giving to Reed. To break the tension she goes for a swim.The creature swims along with her, mimicking some of her swimming moves, unsure what to make of the situation. At one point it briefly grazes her leg while she is floating on the surface. Rather than be surprised, she dives to investigate, further firing the creature's curiosity.Back on board, the boat is upset by the pressure being put on the net. Quickly they try to haul the net in, only to discover a huge tear in the net and what appears to be a fang or claw. Kay begins to wonder now exactly what might have touched her while swimming.Williams decides to go back down and hunt whatever is in the lagoon. Reed opposes the course of action, but is over ruled. While on the dive the two men catch sight of the creature and attempt to shoot it with a spear fishing gun. They hit it once but it escapes before they can capture it.Lucas tells the men when they get back on board that there was an old river legend about a gill man who lived underwater. Reed things he has photographed the creature but the images appear blank. On deck one of the men is attacked and dragged into the water by the creature.Lucas tells the team about a native poison he has which makes fish come to the surface. All agree it is a good idea and begin spreading it over the lagoon. After some time a huge number of fish float to the surface but no sign of the creature. They surmise the poison is not getting down deep enough and create some pellets to flush the creature from the bottom. They wait for hours well into the night with no result. As the survey the lagoon the creature, unaffected by the poison ,attempts to climb into the boat . He is frightened by the light of a lantern. They see a trail of bubbles leading to the bank. When they fix a search light on it, the creature suddenly rears up, roars and disappears.Reed and Willliams follow the creature, discovering a cave hidden by the bank. They begin tracking footprints through the sand. The creature doubles back on the men. Reaching the boat it kills one of the crew then attempts to kidnap Kay.

In an economically depressed environment in which many are out of work, more gather by the docks each morning hoping to secure work for that day than can be hired, placing Johnny Friendly and his forces in a position to exploit them. Those who complain of the working conditions or wages one day don't work the next day, or are placed in harm's way. Consequently, most tolerate being abused.After befriending both the sister (Eva Marie Saint) of the murdered man and the local priest (Karle Malden), Terry gradually becomes a man of deeper morality, and starts to speak of acts against Friendly, who will soon go on trial. Terry finds his breaking point when his brother is murdered by Friendly's thugs, and causes him to entertain thoughts of testifying against Friendly. Still, he struggles to find the courage to do so, until the priest persuades him to.Once he betrays Friendly, Terry is without the work that always came his way when he and his brother were trusted and valued associates. Still, he confronts Friendly by the docks and when all the dock workers are witness to the brutal beating of Terry by Friendly, they refuse to work unless Terry is also allowed to work. This is the catalyst for a new tone of understanding between the workers and the dock bosses.Terry had neither wanted nor intended to be a hero, but, as a man of principle, he had become not only a hero, but a symbol of the workers' intolerance of exploitation by the dock bosses.===================================Terry Malloy, a former boxer, works as a stevedore on the urban waterfront near New York City. When the story opens, he's leaving the office/shack of Johnny Friendly, the head of the local dockworker's union. Johnny tells Terry ""You take it from here, Slugger."" Terry goes to the tenement of Joey Doyle, another dock worker and calls him out, saying that he recovered one of Joey's carrier pigeons. Joey cautiously accepts and tells Terry to meet him on the roof of the tenement. Terry looks up and sees two shady men waiting on the roof.Terry goes to Friendly's bar and stands outside with two of Friendly's enforcers, Truck and Tillio. Truck asks him if Doyle went to the roof and Terry tells him he did. A moment later, a scream is heard and Joey falls from the roof. Though everyone seems to accept that Joey simply slipped and fell, everyone also knows that he was murdered on orders from Friendly because Doyle had planned to testify to the Waterfront Crime Commission about unsafe and unfair working conditions in Friendly's local union. Terry himself seems upset that a nice kid like Joey, who was well-liked in the neighborhood, would be killed by Johnny's men when he believed they would simply intimidate him into forgetting about his testimony. Truck and Tillio laugh over Doyle's death, calling him a ""canary"" (slang for an informant who would betray the union.)In the bar, Terry is still upset. One of Friendly's cronies, Skins, drops by with money for Johnny from a payoff and, when the money is counted, he comes up short. Johnny viciously searches the man and comes up with the missing money and forcibly throws the man out. When he sees that Terry is upset, he begins to lecture him on how violence is necessary to enforce his rules and keep everyone in line. Johnny also admits to ordering Doyle's murder. For setting Doyle up, Johnny tells his foreman, Big Mac, to give Terry a cushy job during the next day's shift at his pier.Out in the alley where Joey was thrown off the roof his sister, Edie, and Father Barry, the local Catholic priest, look over the body of Joey. Edie angrily pleads with other people in the neighborhood about why Joey, well-liked by his friends and the local kids, would be murdered. Everyone knows, but none want to say anything. Edie also becomes angry with Father Barry, saying he doesn't know about the violence in the area because he's too busy with running his church to actually visit the waterfront.The next day, the dockworkers gather at Johnny Friendly's pier. Big Mac runs a shape-up system where tags are given to selected men to work the ship. Edie is there, with Father Barry, who tells her that she was right; he has come down to see just how bad the situation is. Edie's father, Pop Doyle, also shows up because he needs to earn money for his son's funeral. He also gives his dead son's coat to another worker, Kayo Dugan, who accepts it.While waiting for his name to be called, Terry is approached by two officials from the Waterfront Crime Commission. One of them recognizes Terry from his boxing days and asks him if he'll testify to the commission about Joey's murder. Terry flatly refuses. The other man tells Terry they'll supoena him if necessary.Mac calls out the names of men who get regular work, and Terry is among them. The remaining tags are passed out at Mac's discretion; when the men who aren't chosen become angry with him, Mac throws the tags behind them and a minor riot breaks out. Pop is pushed out of the crowd by the younger men. When Edie tries to grab a tag for her father, Terry grabs it first and won't give it to Edie. When one of the other men points out to Terry that she's Joey's sister, he gives her the tag. Edie gives it to her father; Pop admonishes Father Barry for letting Edie witness the riot. The other men are disheartened and Barry tells them that no union would ever let what just occurred happen. The men explain how a ""trigger local"" works: anyone who gets out of line is eliminated by Johnny and his goons. They also explain that meetings among union members are impossible since Johnny has spies working everywhere. Barry suggests they all meet in the basement of his church.In the ship's hold, Terry is loafing on a pile of sacks when his brother, Charley ""The Gent"", Johnny's right-hand man, finds him and gives him a small job to do. Johnny wants Terry to be a spy during the meeting Father Barry called that night at the church. Terry is reluctant but Charley reminds him that he and Johnny have done a lot of favors for Terry. Terry agrees to go.At the church that night, Barry calls the meeting to order, noting that attendance is very low. He explains to the men what they already know: working conditions are bad and their union is powerless as long as it's run by Friendly's gang. Barry also suggests that if they can talk openly about why Joey Doyle was murdered then they'll make progress. Edie asks Joey's best friend, Jimmy, to say something, but he turns her down. Barry tells them that they only way they'll be able to make better lives for themselves is to stand up to Johnny. One of the tougher men in the crowd, Kayo Dugan, tells Barry that the rule is everyone is ""deaf and dumb"" about Johnny. Dugan also notices that Terry is sitting in one of the back pews and recognizes him as a spy. Despite his attempts at coaching, Barry is unable to convince the men. As Barry's fellow priest calls the meeting to an end with a prayer, a window is suddenly smashed in and the rattling of pounding clubs is heard outside: Johnny's men have surrounded the church. Anyone who tries to escape is severely beaten. Terry takes Edie out of the church safely. Dugan, while trying to escape, is beaten bloody by Johnny's goons but is rescued by Father Barry. Barry angrily asks Dugan if he still wants to remain deaf and dumb and seems to get through to Dugan. Dugan promises to testify as long as he has Barry's support. Dugan also warns Barry that Johnny's goons won't hesitate to lean on a priest as well.In the park in front of the church, Terry sees that Edie gets out of the area safely. While they talk, a homeless man confronts them, asking for money. The man recognizes both Terry and Edie. When he begins to talk about Joey's death and how Terry set him up, Terry yells at him to leave. The man does.When she gets home, Edie finds her father packing her things. Edie, a student at an upstate Catholic college, had been visiting her family. Pop tells her that she should leave the neighborhood because of the violence she's seen so far. He also tells her he knows she was with Terry Malloy and how Terry is connected to Johnny Friendly. Edie refuses to leave, driven by her need to know why her brother was killed.On the roof of his building, Terry tends to his flock of carrier pigeons. Terry talks to a couple of kids from the neighborhood and sees Edie over at Joey's coop. Terry goes to her and they talk for a while, about how pigeons are victims of predatory birds in the city, mostly hawks. Terry offers to take Edie out for a drink at a local bar and she accepts. While they talk, she tells Terry of her interest in solving Joey's murder. Terry warns her not to snoop around too much because it could be dangerous. They dance for a while at a wedding being held in the bar when one of Johnny's men, Barney, tells him that Johnny wants to meet with him. Terry tells him he'll go when he's ready to. Terry also runs into of of the Crime Commission agents who hands him a supeona. Terry is still steadfast and tears up the papers, refusing to ""eat cheese"" (become an informer).Later, Terry walks home and is stopped by Johnny and Charlie. Johnny asks Terry about the church meeting and Terry tells him it was run by Father Barry and that very little was discussed that could threaten Johnny's position. Johnny counters, telling Terry that KO Dugan had gone to the crime commission and gave a sworn statement about the illicit operations and corruption of Johnny's union. Johnny suggests that they use their ""muscle"" to eliminate Dugan. Johnny also feels that Terry didn't do his job fully and tells him he won't have his cushy job in the yard anymore, that he's going back to work in the ""hole"". Charlie also admonishes Terry about his budding relationship with Eve Doyle, saying it's ""unhealthy"" for him to be dating the sister of the man they killed.The next day Terry is working alongside Dugan in the ship's hold, unloading crates of Irish whiskey. Terry feels the need to warn Kayo about Johnny's intentions but Kayo ignores him. As one of the pallets loaded with crates is hoisted out, the crane operator drops it on Kayo, killing him in what looks like an accident. Later, after Kayo's body has been uncovered, Father Barry gives a stirring speech to the entire workforce, telling them that Johnny and his men are using them for cheap labor and killing them when they choose to stand up for their rights. Johnny's men begin to throw rotten fruit and cans at Barry, who calmly continues to talk. One of the men, Tillio, is about to throw something when Terry stops him and punches him out. One of the men gives Joey's jacket back to Edie (she later gives it to Terry). Kayo's body is hoisted out of the hold, with Barry and Pop Doyle riding the pallet.Terry, whose conscience has been bothering him, meets with Father Barry. He tells Barry he may just testify to the Crime Commission but he doesn't want to implicate his brother or his friends. He also tells the priest that he set Joey Doyle up to be killed. Barry tells Terry that his loyalty to Charlie and Johnny is misplaced. He also tells Terry that a good step to take would be to tell Edie what he did. Edie had been coming to see Barry herself and Barry convinces Terry to tell her. Terry meets her and tells her, while a ship's whistle blows, making what he tells her inaudible. Edie is horrified and runs away.Terry later checks on his pigeons on his roof. He sees one of the men from the Crime Commission who approached him on the docks. Terry asks the advice of one of the boys who hangs out with him on the roof about testifying; the boy tells him it's not a good idea to get involved, especially since Terry founded the gang the kid is now a member of. The officer tries to talk to Terry and is mostly unsuccessful until he mentions the fight Terry had boxed in years before involving another man named Wilson. Terry is suddenly quite chatty with the man, hinting that he'd thrown the fight so that Charlie, Johnny and their friends could win a huge purse by betting on Wilson. Terry tells the officer straight out that he could have beaten Wilson easily and talks about his technique. Though we don't hear the rest of the conversation, it is strongly hinted that Terry may testify against Johnny.At Johnny's office, one of Johnny's spies reports that he'd seen Terry talking to the agent. Charlie tries to defend Terry, saying that Edie has Terry's emotional state mixed up. Johnny is unfazed however and orders Charlie to talk to his brother. If Terry won't ""dummy up"" then Charlie will take him to one of Johnny's hit men, Jerry G. Charlie is shocked ad tries to reason with Johnny, who refuses to listen. Charlie leaves Johnny's office to find Terry.Charlie picks up Terry in a taxicab and they two have a lengthy conversation where Charlie asks Terry about his supeona and if he plans to rat out Johnny in court.Terry still seems undecided and Charlie reminds him about all the favors he and Johnny have done for him over the years and even offers Terry a cushy job at another pier Johnny will be opening soon. When Terry seems more likely to testify, Charlie tells Terry to make up his mind before they arrive at Jerry G's place. Terry is stunned that his own brother would suggest that he'll be turned over to a hit man, Charlie pulls out a pistol and tells Terry to take the job he was offered. Charlie suddenly comes to his senses and breaks down. He recounts how Terry was once a potentially great athlete and says that Terry's manager was responsible for ruining whatever career he might have had as a boxer. Terry counters, saying that Charlie was responsible for his downfall, betting on Wilson all those years ago and destroying whatever shot Terry might have had at a prestigious boxing title. Charlie realizes how badly he's treated his brother over the years and gives Terry the gun, telling him ""you're gonna need it."" He orders the driver to pull over and let Terry out. The driver, one of Johnny's spies, suddenly pulls into Jerry G's place nearby, where Johnny's waiting.Terry goes to Edie and Pop's apartment. Edie refuses to open the door for him and Terry breaks in, telling her she loves him. She tells him to leave and he grabs her and kisses her, Edie showing little resistance. A voice calls to Terry from the alley below, telling him his brother is there and wants to see him. Terry rushes down to the alley and begins to walk toward the voice. Edie follows, stopping momentarily to talk to one of her neighbors, who mentions that her own son was killed when he went looking for a man who was calling him into the alley. While Edie runs to Terry, a truck starts up and rushes toward them both; Terry breaks the window of a nearby door and they jump out of the way. Terry looks at the truck as it speeds off and sees his brother hanging by a longshoreman's hook piercing his coat. There are several bullet holes in his chest. Terry, his arm bleeding from the broken glass, hauls his brother down, and distraughtly tells Edie to get Father Barry and stay with Charlie until he arrives.Terry goes immediately to Friendly's bar and holds everyone hostage at gunpoint. Tillio shows up and Terry orders him to stay as well. Father Barry shows up; Terry remains defensive with the pistol while Barry tells him to give it up. Terry tells Barry to ""go to Hell"" and Barry hits him in the face and Terry's hostages escape. Terry begins shouting about how the situation isn't Barry's concern and Barry tells him that shooting Johnny would be useless since the law would favor Johnny. Barry tells Terry that the best thing he can do to avenge his brother's murder is to testify in court and strip Johnny of his power. He also tells Terry to get rid of the gun unless he's too cowardly. He gives Terry a beer; Terry takes a sip and throws the pistol at a picture of Johnny with an important-looking city official, shattering it.At the waterfront crime hearings, Terry testifies about Joey's murder. He's grilled at length about not only being the last person to see Joey alive but also about how Johnny Friendly had angrily said that it was necessary to have Joey killed to protect his interests in the union. In another office, a man watches the hearings on TV and hears Terry's testimony. He orders the TV shut off and tells his assistant that he won't accept any calls from Johnny Friendly. Terry finishes on the stand and, as he walks past Johnny, who's been called to the stand. Johnny mutters threats and becomes furious and attacks Terry, finally calming down.Terry goes home, followed by two cops. He tells them to stop following him and they scoff. He passes a friend on the stairs, who refuses to talk to him. In his apartment, Edie is waiting. Terry talks about losing many friends because he testified and Edie asks if they are ""real"" friends to him anyway. Terry goes up to the roof and finds that his young friend has killed all of his pigeons. Edie suggests that they leave the waterfront and go to a farm out west where they'll be left alone. Terry notices a ship coming in to Johnny's pier and, grabbing his hook and donning Joey's jacket, goes to the pier. At the pier, Terry recieves a cold welcome from his former friends. He stands there while Big Mac calls the workers in. Mac passes Terry over for a job and when Terry suggests they need more men, Mac hires the first homeless man standing in the area. Terry becomes enraged and marches down to the gangplank leading to John Friendly's office. He throws his hook at the door and Johnny emerges. Knowing that attacking Terry in public would get him into deeper trouble, he tells Terry to get lost. Terry begins to berate Johnny openly, telling him he's happy that he testified against Johnny, especially for killing anyone who crossed him. Johnny goads Terry into charging him and the two begin to fight. When it becomes obvious that Johnny will lose, he calls his goons in to help and they viciously beat Terry. Father Barry and Edie arrive on the scene just as Johnny orders his thugs to stop. The owner of the ship that arrived demands to know when the men will begin unloading the cargo and Johnny begins to muscle his way through the crowd, ordering the onlookers to begin working. When he reaches Pop Doyle, he grabs him. Pop pushes Johnny off the gangplank and into the water; the crowd cheers. A few of the men find Terry and see how badly he's been beaten. Barry encourages Terry to get up and walk to the pier to go to work (he tells Terry that Johnny is taking bets that he won't make it); if he does, the other men will follow him and oust Johnny as their leader. Terry walks up to the pier, stumbling and falling. He reaches the pier entrance and the ship's owner calls the rest of the men to work. They enter and the door rolls shut behind them.","

    Synopsis
    Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) once dreamt of being a great prize fighter, but now works at the docks of Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) , the corrupt boss of the dockers union. He witnesses a murder by a couple of Johnny's thugs, but won't betray Friendly, who is both his brother's (Rod Steiger) boss and a long-time friend of his family.What he sees at the docks repulses Terry. In an economically depressed environment in which many are out of work, more gather by the docks each morning hoping to secure work for that day than can be hired, placing Johnny Friendly and his forces in a position to exploit them.

Charlie also admonishes Terry about his budding relationship with Eve Doyle, saying it's ""unhealthy"" for him to be dating the sister of the man they killed.The next day Terry is working alongside Dugan in the ship's hold, unloading crates of Irish whiskey. Terry feels the need to warn Kayo about Johnny's intentions but Kayo ignores him. As one of the pallets loaded with crates is hoisted out, the crane operator drops it on Kayo, killing him in what looks like an accident. Later, after Kayo's body has been uncovered, Father Barry gives a stirring speech to the entire workforce, telling them that Johnny and his men are using them for cheap labor and killing them when they choose to stand up for their rights. Johnny's men begin to throw rotten fruit and cans at Barry, who calmly continues to talk. One of the men, Tillio, is about to throw something when Terry stops him and punches him out. One of the men gives Joey's jacket back to Edie (she later gives it to Terry). Kayo's body is hoisted out of the hold, with Barry and Pop Doyle riding the pallet.Terry, whose conscience has been bothering him, meets with Father Barry. He tells Barry he may just testify to the Crime Commission but he doesn't want to implicate his brother or his friends. He also tells the priest that he set Joey Doyle up to be killed. Barry tells Terry that his loyalty to Charlie and Johnny is misplaced. He also tells Terry that a good step to take would be to tell Edie what he did. Edie had been coming to see Barry herself and Barry convinces Terry to tell her. Terry meets her and tells her, while a ship's whistle blows, making what he tells her inaudible. Edie is horrified and runs away.Terry later checks on his pigeons on his roof. He sees one of the men from the Crime Commission who approached him on the docks. Terry asks the advice of one of the boys who hangs out with him on the roof about testifying; the boy tells him it's not a good idea to get involved, especially since Terry founded the gang the kid is now a member of. The officer tries to talk to Terry and is mostly unsuccessful until he mentions the fight Terry had boxed in years before involving another man named Wilson. Terry is suddenly quite chatty with the man, hinting that he'd thrown the fight so that Charlie, Johnny and their friends could win a huge purse by betting on Wilson. Terry tells the officer straight out that he could have beaten Wilson easily and talks about his technique. Though we don't hear the rest of the conversation, it is strongly hinted that Terry may testify against Johnny.At Johnny's office, one of Johnny's spies reports that he'd seen Terry talking to the agent. Charlie tries to defend Terry, saying that Edie has Terry's emotional state mixed up. Johnny is unfazed however and orders Charlie to talk to his brother. If Terry won't ""dummy up"" then Charlie will take him to one of Johnny's hit men, Jerry G. Charlie is shocked ad tries to reason with Johnny, who refuses to listen. Charlie leaves Johnny's office to find Terry.Charlie picks up Terry in a taxicab and they two have a lengthy conversation where Charlie asks Terry about his supeona and if he plans to rat out Johnny in court.Terry still seems undecided and Charlie reminds him about all the favors he and Johnny have done for him over the years and even offers Terry a cushy job at another pier Johnny will be opening soon. When Terry seems more likely to testify, Charlie tells Terry to make up his mind before they arrive at Jerry G's place. Terry is stunned that his own brother would suggest that he'll be turned over to a hit man, Charlie pulls out a pistol and tells Terry to take the job he was offered. Charlie suddenly comes to his senses and breaks down. He recounts how Terry was once a potentially great athlete and says that Terry's manager was responsible for ruining whatever career he might have had as a boxer. Terry counters, saying that Charlie was responsible for his downfall, betting on Wilson all those years ago and destroying whatever shot Terry might have had at a prestigious boxing title. Charlie realizes how badly he's treated his brother over the years and gives Terry the gun, telling him ""you're gonna need it."" He orders the driver to pull over and let Terry out. The driver, one of Johnny's spies, suddenly pulls into Jerry G's place nearby, where Johnny's waiting.Terry goes to Edie and Pop's apartment. Edie refuses to open the door for him and Terry breaks in, telling her she loves him. She tells him to leave and he grabs her and kisses her, Edie showing little resistance. A voice calls to Terry from the alley below, telling him his brother is there and wants to see him. Terry rushes down to the alley and begins to walk toward the voice. Edie follows, stopping momentarily to talk to one of her neighbors, who mentions that her own son was killed when he went looking for a man who was calling him into the alley. While Edie runs to Terry, a truck starts up and rushes toward them both; Terry breaks the window of a nearby door and they jump out of the way. Terry looks at the truck as it speeds off and sees his brother hanging by a longshoreman's hook piercing his coat. There are several bullet holes in his chest. Terry, his arm bleeding from the broken glass, hauls his brother down, and distraughtly tells Edie to get Father Barry and stay with Charlie until he arrives.Terry goes immediately to Friendly's bar and holds everyone hostage at gunpoint. Tillio shows up and Terry orders him to stay as well. Father Barry shows up; Terry remains defensive with the pistol while Barry tells him to give it up. Terry tells Barry to ""go to Hell"" and Barry hits him in the face and Terry's hostages escape. Terry begins shouting about how the situation isn't Barry's concern and Barry tells him that shooting Johnny would be useless since the law would favor Johnny. Barry tells Terry that the best thing he can do to avenge his brother's murder is to testify in court and strip Johnny of his power. He also tells Terry to get rid of the gun unless he's too cowardly. He gives Terry a beer; Terry takes a sip and throws the pistol at a picture of Johnny with an important-looking city official, shattering it.At the waterfront crime hearings, Terry testifies about Joey's murder. He's grilled at length about not only being the last person to see Joey alive but also about how Johnny Friendly had angrily said that it was necessary to have Joey killed to protect his interests in the union. In another office, a man watches the hearings on TV and hears Terry's testimony. He orders the TV shut off and tells his assistant that he won't accept any calls from Johnny Friendly. Terry finishes on the stand and, as he walks past Johnny, who's been called to the stand. Johnny mutters threats and becomes furious and attacks Terry, finally calming down.Terry goes home, followed by two cops. He tells them to stop following him and they scoff. He passes a friend on the stairs, who refuses to talk to him. In his apartment, Edie is waiting. Terry talks about losing many friends because he testified and Edie asks if they are ""real"" friends to him anyway. Terry goes up to the roof and finds that his young friend has killed all of his pigeons. Edie suggests that they leave the waterfront and go to a farm out west where they'll be left alone. Terry notices a ship coming in to Johnny's pier and, grabbing his hook and donning Joey's jacket, goes to the pier. At the pier, Terry recieves a cold welcome from his former friends. He stands there while Big Mac calls the workers in. Mac passes Terry over for a job and when Terry suggests they need more men, Mac hires the first homeless man standing in the area. Terry becomes enraged and marches down to the gangplank leading to John Friendly's office. He throws his hook at the door and Johnny emerges. Knowing that attacking Terry in public would get him into deeper trouble, he tells Terry to get lost. Terry begins to berate Johnny openly, telling him he's happy that he testified against Johnny, especially for killing anyone who crossed him. Johnny goads Terry into charging him and the two begin to fight. When it becomes obvious that Johnny will lose, he calls his goons in to help and they viciously beat Terry. Father Barry and Edie arrive on the scene just as Johnny orders his thugs to stop. The owner of the ship that arrived demands to know when the men will begin unloading the cargo and Johnny begins to muscle his way through the crowd, ordering the onlookers to begin working. When he reaches Pop Doyle, he grabs him. Pop pushes Johnny off the gangplank and into the water; the crowd cheers. A few of the men find Terry and see how badly he's been beaten. Barry encourages Terry to get up and walk to the pier to go to work (he tells Terry that Johnny is taking bets that he won't make it); if he does, the other men will follow him and oust Johnny as their leader. Terry walks up to the pier, stumbling and falling. He reaches the pier entrance and the ship's owner calls the rest of the men to work. They enter and the door rolls shut behind them.

                    Sabrina Fairchild grew up in an apartment over a garage on the sprawling Long Island estate owned by the Larrabees, for who her widowed father works as the family chauffeur. Fairchild and the other estate servants are aware that Sabrina has always been in love from afar with the Larrabees' younger son, several times married but currently single playboy David Larrabee, who has never noticed her except as the gangly kid on the estate. The Larrabees' older son, Linus Larrabee, has always been the responsible hard working one of the two siblings, he focused so much on making money now running the Larrabee conglomerate of businesses to have a personal life. As such, neither he or Sabrina ever really noticed each other beyond their roles on the estate, not really knowing anything about the other. David also works for the company, in name and on paper only, as he goes about his fun loving activities as his day to day life. Linus, however, is not averse to using David's personal life for business benefit, such as publicly announcing David's imminent marriage to Elizabeth Tyson, the daughter of a prospective business partner, an engagement about which David knows nothing. David likes Elizabeth as a casual girlfriend, but he has no intention of getting remarried. This move coincides with Sabrina's return after a two year absence away at culinary school in Paris, something she initially did not want to do in not wanting to be away from David, because and despite her unrequited love for him, which was also one of the reasons Fairchild sent her away. Sabrina's time away has let her grow into her own skin, she now believing that she truly can shoot for the moon, whether that moon be David or anything else. David falls in his brand of love with this new sophisticated version of Sabrina, who he didn't even recognize upon first sighting. Linus, in turn, subversively takes whatever direct action to ensure David marries Elizabeth regardless of his new infatuation with Sabrina. Through these proceedings, Sabrina may truly come to realize what her moon is and if it is achievable, that road which may have some possible heartache along the way.

But the mood is sombre: word has come down that their beloved commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger), is being relieved of command. He arrives for the end of the show and delivers an emotional farewell. The men give him a rousing send-off (""The Old Man"").After the war, over the next 10 years, the pair make it big as performers in nightclubs, radio, and then on Broadway, doing many different songs, and finally becoming successful producers living in Florida. They eventually mount their newest hit musical entitled 'Playing Around'. The same day they receive a letter from ""Freckle-Faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy,"" their mess sergeant from the war, asking them to look at an act which his two sisters are doing.When they go to the club to audition the act (""Sisters""), Phil notices that Bob is slowly smitten with Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney), while Phil has eyes for her sister, Judy (Vera-Ellen). Following their number, Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table, and believing he may have found the right woman for Bob, Phil brings Judy on to the dance floor so that Bob and Betty can get to know each other better. Phil and Judy hit it off (""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"").Judy tells Phil that she and her sister are headed for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, where they are booked to perform over the holidays. Phil gives the sisters his and Bob's sleeping-room accommodations aboard the train to Vermont.When the train arrives in Pine Tree, there's not a flake in sight, and the weather is so unseasonably warm, chances of it falling appear dim. Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer, General Waverly. Waverly has invested all of his savings and pension into the lodge, which is in danger of failing because of the lack of snow and consequent lack of guests. Deciding to help out and bring business up to the inn, Bob and Phil bring up the entire cast and crew of their new musical 'Playing Around', and add in Betty and Judy where they can. At the same time, Bob and Betty's relationship starts to bloom (""Count Your Blessings"") and they begin to spend a good deal of time together. Meanwhile, Bob discovers the General's rejected attempt at rejoining the army, and decides to prove to the General that he isn't forgotten.Bob calls Ed Harrison (Johnny Grant), an old army buddy, now the host of a successful TV variety show. Bob tells Ed that he wants to make a televised pitch to all the men formerly under the command of the General, asking them to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. In response, Harrison suggests they go all out and put the show on national television, playing up the whole ""schmaltz"" angle of the situation and generating lots of free advertising for Wallace and Davis in the process. What Bob doesn't know is that nosy housekeeper Emma Allen (Mary Wickes) has been listening in to the phone conversation on the extension but has only heard about the whole schmaltz suggestion, hanging up before Bob rejects the idea.Mistakenly believing that her beloved boss will be presented as a pitiable figure on a prime-time coast to coast broadcast, Emma reveals what she heard to a shocked Betty who is originally loath to believe Bob would pull such a stunt for his own gain, but mistakenly comes to believe he would indeed stoop to such depths when Phil asks her if he made the call to Ed. The misunderstanding causes a now-disillusioned Betty to grow suddenly cold toward a baffled Bob. Unaware of the real reason for her sudden change of behavior, Judy becomes convinced that Betty, ever-protective of her little sister, will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures an extremely reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City, having received a job offer.Distraught, Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement announcement was phony, and Bob, still unaware of the real reason behind Betty's annoyance, heads to New York to explain. Bob goes to see Betty's new act (""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me"") and reveals the truth about the engagement, but is called away by Ed Harrison before he can find out what is really bothering her. The sight of Ed pushes Betty who was nearly forgiving Bob, back down. Meanwhile, back at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract Waverly so he won't see the broadcast or Bob's announcement.On the broadcast, Bob proceeds to ask the veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve (""What Can You Do with a General""). When Betty is backstage between performances, she catches Bob's pitch on a television set and realizes she was mistaken. She returns to Pine Tree just in time for the show on Christmas Eve. Emma convinces Gen. Waverly that all his suits were sent to the cleaners and suggests he wear his old uniform to the opening of the show. Initially reluctant, he agrees. When the General enters the lodge where the show is to take place, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of ""The Old Man."" Just as the following number (""Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army"") ends, he is notified that snow is finally falling.In the finale scene, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another, as do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling, everyone raises a glass, and toasts, ""May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white.""

                    Wallace & Davis - Bob and Phil respectively - is a famed Broadway act. When Bob and Phil met while in the same platoon under the command of tough on the surface but kindly underneath Major General Thomas F. Waverly in WWII, Bob was already a famous solo act, but Phil, who saved Bob's life, used that to convince Bob to add him, then an unknown, to his act. Bob is all work, knowing that dating showgirls is not the means to a lasting romantic life, while Phil wants Bob to lighten up if only to get Bob out of his constant hair. On their travels just before Christmas, they meet The Haynes Sisters - Betty and Judy - an up and coming club act, and sisters of another of their platoon mates. Betty is the mother hen, while Judy does whatever she needs to for them to gain a little edge in the business. Bob attracted to Betty and Phil attracted to Judy, Bob and Phil decide to follow Betty and Judy to the Columbia Inn in Pinetree, Vermont, a ski resort where the sisters are performing for the holidays, rather than their original plan to head back to New York to rehearse their latest show. Unknown to Bob and Phil, the Columbia Inn is owned by a now retired General Waverly, who sunk his life savings into the Inn. He risks losing it all because in America's winter wonderland, there is currently no snow and thus no paying guests. To help the General for all he did for them while in the army, Bob and Phil decide at great expense to themselves to bring their entire show from New York to the Inn, which they believe will bring in the guests regardless of the lack of snow. Adding Betty and Judy to the show, Bob and Phil start to seriously fall for the two sisters. But a happy ending for Bob and Betty is threatened by a misunderstanding, which is further complicated by meddling Phil and Judy, who just want to see their partner and sister respectively in a happily ever after.

Deciding to help out and bring business up to the inn, Bob and Phil bring up the entire cast and crew of their new musical 'Playing Around', and add in Betty and Judy where they can. At the same time, Bob and Betty's relationship starts to bloom (""Count Your Blessings"") and they begin to spend a good deal of time together. Meanwhile, Bob discovers the General's rejected attempt at rejoining the army, and decides to prove to the General that he isn't forgotten.Bob calls Ed Harrison (Johnny Grant), an old army buddy, now the host of a successful TV variety show. Bob tells Ed that he wants to make a televised pitch to all the men formerly under the command of the General, asking them to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. In response, Harrison suggests they go all out and put the show on national television, playing up the whole ""schmaltz"" angle of the situation and generating lots of free advertising for Wallace and Davis in the process. What Bob doesn't know is that nosy housekeeper Emma Allen (Mary Wickes) has been listening in to the phone conversation on the extension but has only heard about the whole schmaltz suggestion, hanging up before Bob rejects the idea.Mistakenly believing that her beloved boss will be presented as a pitiable figure on a prime-time coast to coast broadcast, Emma reveals what she heard to a shocked Betty who is originally loath to believe Bob would pull such a stunt for his own gain, but mistakenly comes to believe he would indeed stoop to such depths when Phil asks her if he made the call to Ed. The misunderstanding causes a now-disillusioned Betty to grow suddenly cold toward a baffled Bob. Unaware of the real reason for her sudden change of behavior, Judy becomes convinced that Betty, ever-protective of her little sister, will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures an extremely reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City, having received a job offer.Distraught, Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement announcement was phony, and Bob, still unaware of the real reason behind Betty's annoyance, heads to New York to explain. Bob goes to see Betty's new act (""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me"") and reveals the truth about the engagement, but is called away by Ed Harrison before he can find out what is really bothering her. The sight of Ed pushes Betty who was nearly forgiving Bob, back down. Meanwhile, back at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract Waverly so he won't see the broadcast or Bob's announcement.On the broadcast, Bob proceeds to ask the veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve (""What Can You Do with a General""). When Betty is backstage between performances, she catches Bob's pitch on a television set and realizes she was mistaken. She returns to Pine Tree just in time for the show on Christmas Eve. Emma convinces Gen. Waverly that all his suits were sent to the cleaners and suggests he wear his old uniform to the opening of the show. Initially reluctant, he agrees. When the General enters the lodge where the show is to take place, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of ""The Old Man."" Just as the following number (""Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army"") ends, he is notified that snow is finally falling.In the finale scene, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another, as do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling, everyone raises a glass, and toasts, ""May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white."" Bob then performs the last musical number before the final fade-out (a reprise of ""White Christmas"").

To please his wife, he has given up tennis and now sells sports equipment. Margot once had a relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), an American crime scriptwriter, but broke it off when he went back to the U.S. for a year.In time they stopped writing to each other, and when Mark returns to London she tells him that she burned all his letters but one. Margo explains to Mark that the letter was stolen by a blackmailer who demanded £50, so Margot payed by mailing the money to a pawn shop location as intended, but the money was never picked up and the letter was never returned. Mark tells Margo that he wants to tell Tony about them so she can divorce Tony so she and Mark can be together, but Margot refuses out of fear of hurting Tony's feelings.It is also revealed that Tony and Margot have made their wills, naming each other as beneficiary with assets and money totaling £90,000. For a year, Tony meticulously plans Margot's murder. She has no idea that Tony knows of her love for Mark. He has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag containing one of Mark's letters, and even assumed the role of the anonymous Brixton-based blackmailer to find out whether she would pay to have it back. (She did, but he asked for only £50 and she did not, of course, get the letter back.) He even watched them having a little farewell party, eating spaghetti with mushrooms in Mark's studio flat in Chelsea.Tony slyly withdraws small amounts of money for a year, collecting £1,000 in (used) one-pound (£1) notes, with which he plans to pay a contract killer. He singles out the perfect man to do the job: Charles Alexander ""C.A."" Swann (Anthony Dawson), who now calls himself ""Captain Lesgate"", a former acquaintance who has embarked on a life of petty crime since even before leaving Cambridge where he and Tony were both students. By following him and finding out about his past and associations, Tony soon gets enough to blackmail Swann into murdering his wife.Tony uses the opportunity of Mark's return to London to carry out his plan. Under a pretext he has to prepare an urgent report for his boss, he has Margot and Mark go to the theatre and, when they are gone, he invites Swann to his flat under another pretext - wanting to buy an expensive car from him. When Swann arrives at 61A Charrington Gardens that night, Tony gets down to business. There is no time to lose, as he has planned the murder for the following night. Trapped in a corner by the revelations of his past crimes and tempted by the money, Swann reluctantly agrees to carry out the murder.Tony has invited Mark to join him at a stag party in a nearby hotel; this is how he secures himself an alibi. The idea is that the police should think that a burglar was surprised by Margot, that he panicked, strangled her and left without the loot. He has told Swann that he is going to phone his own flat at exactly 11:00 p.m. so that Margot will come to the living-room to answer the phone, whereupon she will be murdered by Swann. There are only two keys to the Wendices' ground floor apartment. Before leaving for the stag party, Tony steals Margot's key from her handbag and hides it under the stair carpet outside their flat for Swann to use.Mark, a writer of crime scenarios, says at one point that, theoretically, he would be able to plan the perfect murder but that it would be impossible to carry out any plan of his because in real life people just do not act according to other people's plans. This is true of Margot, too: Instead of listening to the radio in her bedroom when Tony and Mark are away, she tells her husband of her own plans to go to the cinema that night. Tony has a hard time persuading his wife to instead stay at home and stick into an album some old newspaper clippings of his when he was a tennis star. Margot finally consents and for that reason takes a (seemingly) huge pair of scissors out of her mending basket (which also contains a pair of her stockings). When she has finished the tiresome job she goes to bed, carelessly leaving the scissors lying on the desk next to the phone.According to Tony's plan, Swann secretly enters the Wendices' flat shortly before 11 o'clock, hides behind the drawn curtains, a scarf in his hands, and waits for the telephone to ring and for Margot to come out of her bedroom to answer it.At the dinner stag party, Tony's plans again nearly go wrong when his wristwatch stops and he has to ask for the time, and when he learns that it is a few minutes past 11:00, he hurriedly leaves the ballroom and to a payphone in the hotel lobby to make the call. Tony just makes the phone call exactly when Swann is considering leaving his flat. As expected, Margot gets up, enters the living room area, and awnsers the phone. When she does, the plan goes terribly wrong: Swann attacks her from behind with Tony all the while listening in to what is going on over the phone. But Margot turns out to be rather strong and eventually stabs Swann in the back with the scissors that are left on the desk. He falls backwards to the floor, right onto the scissors, and is dead at once. In his panic, Tony tells his sobbing wife not to touch or do anything until he has come home, which he hurriedly does.Clearly nervous, Tony has to work fast now if he wants to come up with an new plan to kill Margot. He soon realizes he can make it look as if Margot had been blackmailed by Swann, that he came to her flat in person and that she actually let him in with the intention of murdering him (rather than killing him in self-defense). After calling the police and sending Margot back to bed, he plants Mark's letter on Swann (to make it appear that he was the one who sent blackmail letters to Margot), finds the latch key on Swann and puts it back in Margot's handbag, and burns the scarf that Swann used, replacing it with one of Margot's stockings. He hides the twin stocking on the desk, but intentionally ""accidentally"" uncovers it for the police to find (making it look as though Margot inflicted the bruises by herself). Finally, Tony tells Margot to deny that he told her not to call the police. Although he tells her that it will lessen the police suspicion, it has the opposite effect, making it appear as though she avoided calling the police.Eventually, the police establish that Swann came in through the hall door rather than the French windows leading into the garden, as his shoes are not dirty. After an intermission, we are introduced to Inspector Hubbard (John Williams), who questions the Wendices and appears to believe the evidence that Tony planted, eventually becoming highly suspicious of Margot. The movie cuts immediately to the trial scene where she is convicted and sentenced to be hanged, thus accomplishing Tony's plan after all.However, there are two things Tony has not reckoned with: (a) that Swann replaced the key under the stair carpet immediately after using it to open the door and, accordingly, the key he takes out of the dead man's pocket is the key to Swann's own flat; and (b) that getting rid of £1,000 in cash (the money he would have paid to Swann, which he does not have to now that he is dead) by making many purchases is a conspicuous thing to do and bound to be investigated by the police (which it is, although Tony is not aware of this).Several months later, on the day before Margot's scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony to propose a very unusual thing to him. Rather than seeing his wife hanged, he could come up with a completely new story, confess at the last minute that he hired Swann to kill his wife and save her life by going to prison for some years himself instead. Coincidentally, Mark has come up with exactly what Tony actually did. Mark argues that during Margot's trial, all arguments revolved around three things only: (1) Mark's letter found on Swann; (2) the fact that no key was found on Swann (and that there was no forced entry either); and (3) Margot's stocking. Mark argues that all this could be altered, and that Tony could put all the blame on himself, claiming that it was he who had done all that.Then Inspector Hubbard arrives at the flat again, purportedly to ask Tony about the money he has been spending lately. This is when Mark discovers Tony's attaché case filled with the remaining one pound notes and presents it to Hubbard when he inquires to Tony about the suitcase. Pressed for an answer, Tony manages a final impromptu lie in front of both Mark and Inspector Hubbard: he tells them this is the money Margot had ready when she met Swann but that she changed her mind and killed him instead of paying him off. The inspector accepts this explanation and dismisses Mark's theory... or so it seems.In fact, the inspector, who has not given up the case yet, remains suspicious of Tony and sets a trap. He borrows the key from Margot's handbag which is kept in prison and goes to Tony's flat while Tony is not home. He finds that it does not fit the lock. He discovers that the key actually fits Swann's door. After some searching, he discovers the actual key under the carpet.Then the inspector uses his final trick. He visits Tony to ask some questions and when he leaves, he deliberately takes Tony's raincoat instead of his own. (The raincoats are apparently very similar and so are the keys.) Tony also leaves his flat. Inspector Hubbard secretly enters the flat, using the key from the raincoat, telephones the prison and asks that Margot be released. Margot, who does not understand why she has been released, goes home, and finds that the key in her handbag does not fit the lock. Hubbard waits some time, he wants to find out whether she knows the hiding place under the stair carpet. She does not, so that clears her of any suspicion. The inspector opens the door for her. Hubbard tells a colleague to take the handbag back to the police station. Hubbard and Margot then wait for Tony's homecoming.When Tony comes home he realizes that he cannot get inside: he is wearing Hubbard's raincoat with Hubbard's key. Hubbard and Margot, along with Mark, hide themselves inside and do not open the door. Then Tony remembers that he had been told to collect Margot's belongings from the police station, so he goes there to fetch her handbag, with the key. When he comes home he finds that the key from Margot's handbag - actually Swann's - does not fit into the lock. Tony starts thinking what could have happened. When he takes the key from under the stair carpet he gives himself away.Tony enters the room to find Margot and the inspector, and Mark too. He realizes he's been found out and congratulates the inspector. After appearing surprised that he has finally been found out, Tony then offers everyone a drink, acting very casual, as tears begin to stream down his wife's face. The last scene is of the inspector, acting in a manner that shows he's proud of himself, as he combs his mustache as he makes a phone call to inform Scotland Yard that they have caught Tony.","
    
                    In London, wealthy Margot Mary Wendice had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice was on a tennis tour. Tony quits playing to dedicate to his wife and finds a regular job. She decides to give him a second chance for their marriage. When Mark arrives from America to visit the couple, Margot tells him that she had destroyed all his letters but one that was stolen. Subsequently she was blackmailed, but she had never retrieved the stolen letter. Tony arrives home, claims that he needs to work and asks Margot to go with Mark to the theater. Meanwhile Tony calls Captain Lesgate (aka Charles Alexander Swann who studied with him at college) and blackmails him to murder his wife, so that he can inherit her fortune. But there is no perfect crime, and things do not work as planned.

                    After learning that his wife Margot had a brief affair with mystery writer Mark Halliday, Tony Wendice decides he's going to kill her. He wants to provide himself with an ironclad alibi and so blackmail a one-time schoolmate with a shady past, Charles Swann, to do the killing for him. The plan is simple. He will give Swann a key to their flat and while he and Halliday are out at a dinner, Swan can let himself into the flat and strangle her. It all goes as planned but Margot successfully defends herself, killing Swan in the process. She is convicted of his murder - Tony had planted evidence to suggest that he had been blackmailing her - and soon finds herself in prison awaiting execution on the gallows. It's left to Mark Halliday and a sympathetic policeman, Chief Inspector Hubbard, to uncover Wendice's plan and get the evidence to arrest him.

                    Residing in London, former tennis pro turned sporting goods salesman Tony Wendice and socialite Margot Wendice have a loving, happy marriage,... or so it appears on the surface. In reality, Margot fell out of love with Tony as a traveling tennis wife, and began an affair with American writer Mark Halliday, who she still loves. Margot decided to make a go of the marriage when Tony gave up tennis for a more steady job, but she still kept one keepsake from Mark, a love letter, which she carried with her everywhere in whatever handbag she was using, that is until the letter was stolen from her handbag. An unknown person is blackmailing her with the letter, threatening to expose the affair to Tony, something she has told no one except Mark. The blackmailer, which in reality is not blackmail but part of a larger plot, is Tony himself. When first discovering the affair, Tony had thought about killing Mark. But now, his carefully thought out plan is to have Margot killed so that he can live off her wealth. That plan, which only recently coalesced into a beginning to end detailed plot, involves blackmailing old college associate Charles Swann, who Tony has recently learned has turned to a life of fraud and murder. While Tony is out for the evening with a visiting Mark, Swann will kill Margot at the Wendice apartment. Tony will have an alibi and Swann should be able to get away scot-free as he has no formal ties to the Wendices and thus no motive to kill Margot. Although Tony considers the plan foolproof, it does not come off quite as planned, with Margot surviving the attack. Tony has to decide what to do, if he should just hide his involvement in the murder plot, or if he has a Plan B up his sleeve still to get rid of Margot for good. Who may factor into what happens are Mark, who will do whatever to help Margot, most specifically using his creative writing skills, and the lead police investigator, Chief Inspector Hubbard, who may see the crime scene in a slightly different light than the average Joe.

Again a flash of light erupts out of the water and the Bingo Maru suffers the same fate as the Eiko Maru.The Coast Guard assures frantic families of the crews of the two ships, that everything is being done including more ships and helicopters committed to the search. Finally there are results as three survivors are found in the water. At the same time reports of the sinking of a fishing boat brings the total of lost ships to three.On Odo island, the port of the missing fishing boat, inhabitants are scanning the sea looking for signs of the boat. A raft is seen with Masaji Sieji (Ren Yamamoto) who lives on the island on board. The islanders pull the raft in Masajis says ""A monster did it"" And passes out close to death.Days later other fishing boats return to the island, complaining their nets are all empty. One of the elders claims it is Godzilla eating the fish. Other members of the village laugh at his quaint ways. The same day a helicopter lands on the island carrying a group of press and military - they interview Masajis who again claims it was a monster. The elder gets their attention and tells the legend of Godzilla. He then explains the history of sacrifices the island used to make to keep Godzilla happy. Now all that is left is the religious ceremony.During the night a typhoon hits the island. The islanders take shelter but along with the normal noise of such storms they can hear something huge moving around. The next morning 12 houses are found to have been destroyed during the night and at least 9 people have died. Discussions between the mayor and eyewitnesses uncover the fact that the destruction of the houses was unusual, and not caused by the storm.Professor Kyohei Yamane suggests a scientific task force go to the island to investigate the situation. As the vessel leaves, a number of passengers are surprised to see the reclusive Dr Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) at the dock to see the expedition off.At the island the team gets to work, first they detect radiation around the ruined buildings and in the water wells. A series of huge shallow depressions are measured. It becomes apparent the depressions are giant foot prints. In one of the depressions they find a trilobite - a creature extinct for millions of years.On the other side of the island an alarm sounds, loud rhythmic thunder can be heard approaching. Many realize it is the same sound heard during the storm. The villagers start to climb the island's central ridge to see what is going on.A huge reptilian rears up and roars at the villagers and disappears. The villages continue towards the creature only to see it disappear into the ocean leaving a series of tracks along a beach.At a meeting convened to discuss the expeditions findings, Professor Yamane surmises Godzilla is a relic from the age of dinosaurs and has been disturbed by recent hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific. He displays the trilobite and the radioactive sand found on the island as proof of his argument. Newspaper reports claim that up to 17 ships have been lost because of Godzilla. A special agency is set up to look into ways to counter the creature before all international trade is stopped with Japan. The Japanese navy goes into action depth charging any areas Godzilla was last seen. In Tokyo Bay a pleasure boat full of party goers sees Godzilla, rather than attack the boat, the creature seems intent on heading for shore. Professor Yammi struggles with the situation. He understands Godzilla needs to be destroyed but feels the creature deserves to live. After all it was man who disturbed and created the creature. He wants to understand what caused things to turn out the way it did.Orgata speaks to the professor Yammi's daughter and asks her to try and talk to talk to Professor Serizawa who is rumored to have a device that could destroy Godzilla. Newspaperman Hagiwara (Sachio Sakai) asks if he can come along to get a better idea of the true story.Serizawa is puzzled at the reporters questions. He denies such a weapon exists, but refuses to say what he is really working on. Emiko waits for the reporter go then presses Serizawa for more information, he relents and shows her what he is doing, but she has to be sworn to secrecy first. In the lab Serizawa shows her a process that turns a tank full of fish to skeletons in mere seconds.Emiko is shocked but validates her promise to Serizawa by not saying anything to Orgata when she returns home. Outside the house sirens sound, and the trade mark thundering steps can be heard in the distance. Godzilla nears the shore and the army opens fire with all the heavy weapons they can muster. Ignoring the armys efforts Godzilla comes ashore destroys a train, then moves into the downtown area. After a protracted battle with the army, the monster destroys a major bridge before heading back to sea.Next morning newspapers are full of images and stories of the attack. It is noted that scientists from all over the world have begun flying in to help defeat the creature. Quickly it is decided to evacuate the coastal areas around Tokyo Bay. Once this is completed an electrified barrier is to be built. Its hoped that by repeated electrocution Godzilla will be turned away and forced back to sea permanently.Now that a plan of action is in place Orgata decides now is a good time to ask Professor Yammi for his daughter Emikos hand in marriage. Yammi is completely uninterested in the advance. He is consumed with questions about Godzilla. Frustrated Orgata starts debating Yammi, ultimately Yammi throws him out of the house dashing Emikos hopes.At nightfall Godzilla is again seen heading for the shoreline. The newly installed electrical barrier is charged and the army takes up position with heavy artillery and tanks. As Godzilla pauses at the barrier the army sees its chance again attacks. Godzilla responds by setting huge fires across the city with its to date unseen radioactive breath.Realizing their plan has failed the authorities initiate code 129 This means rather than fight Godzilla they are only going to concentrate on getting civilians out of harms way. As the plan takes affect a wing of Japanese fighter craft try to distract the creature. Unexpectedly the attack seems to work and Godzilla retreats back to the waters of Tokyo Bay.Rescue efforts switch to high gear, but the sheer numbers of wounded, many suffering radiation sickness completely overwhelm hospitals.

She goes on to describe how Serizawa dropped a device into a tank of fish, seconds later all the fish were just skeletons. Serizawa explains how the device sucks all oxygen from water causing any living creature caught by the process to liquefy instantly. Hearing this Orgata and Emiko agree to confront the Serizawa and convince him to use his discovery. Serizawa counters that to reveal the weapon to the world would unleash a force greater than even the atomic bomb. The only difference is the oxygen destroyer could ultimately kill all mankind.Serizawa is concerned that once the he uses the weapon the genie is out of the bottle and he does not know if he can get it back in. Serizawa is torn by his choice, but he cannot see any way to resolve it. He catches a sight from the TV of people all over the country praying that Godzilla wont return.

At sea a ship with Orgato and Serizawa aboard a ship mounted with Geiger counters locates Godzilla. Orgata prepares to make the dive to deploy the weapon. Serizawa insists he goes with him. They only have one chance and one weapon, so it has to be done properly. Reaching the ocean floor they find Godzilla resting and begin the work to deploy the weapon. Serizawa unexpectedly signals Orgata to return to the surface. Reaching the surface alone Orgato realizes he has been fooled and Serizawas solution was to die deploying the weapon.With one final message Serizawa tells Orgata that the weapon worked and he hopes he and Emiko with be happy together. The weapons effect envelopes Godzilla. The creature struggles for a time before sinking to the bottom uttering one final defiant roar. Moments later nothing remains but a skeleton. Within minutes this is gone tooOnboard the ship Professor Yammi considers the concept that there must be more Godzillas out in the depths of the ocean. If man continues his experiments with atomic weapons, chances are extremely high another Godzilla will return to once again threaten our civilization.","
    
                    Japan is thrown into a panic after several ships explode and are sunk. At first, the authorities think its either underwater mines or underwater volcanic activity. The authorities soon head to Odo Island, close to where several of the ships were sunk. One night, something comes onshore and destroys several houses and kills several people. A later expedition to the island led by paleontologist Professor Kyôhei Yamane, his daughter Emiko, and young navy frogman Hideto Ogata (who also happens to be Emiko's lover, even though she is betrothed to Dr. Daisuke Serizawa) soon discover something more devastating than imagined in the form of a 164-foot-tall (50-meter-tall) monster whom the natives call Gojira. Now, the monster begins a rampage that threatens to destroy not only Japan but the rest of the world as well. Can the monster be destroyed before it is too late, and what role will the mysterious Serizawa play in the battle?

The U.S. government invites Professor Pierre M. Aronnax (Paul Lukas) and his assistant, Conseil (Peter Lorre), to join an expedition to prove or disprove the monster's existence. On board the armed frigate with them is the cocky master harpooner Ned Land (Kirk Douglas).After months of searching, the ""monster"" is spotted after another merchant ship nearby explodes and sinks. After the warship fires its heavy cannons, the monster turns and attacks the frigate, crippling it. Ned and Aronnax are thrown overboard, as is a lifeboat, and Conseil jumps in after Aronnax to save him. Now helpless, the frigate drifts silently and no one aboard answers when the overboard passengers cry out for help. The three drift in the ocean, eventually coming upon a strange-looking metal vessel. They realize the ""monster"" is actually a man-made ""submerging boat"" that appears deserted. Inside, they find a large viewing port amidships and watch a strange underwater funeral procession.Ned, Aronnax and Conseil are spotted, and as they attempt to leave in their lifeboat, the crew returns to their submarine and capture the three castaways. The captain introduces himself as Nemo (James Mason), master of the Nautilus. He returns Ned and Conseil to the deck, while offering Aronnax, whose name he recognizes from Aronnax's scientific work and research, the chance to stay. When Nemo discovers that Aronnax is willing to die with his companions, he finds out what he needed to know and allows Ned and Conseil to stay aboard.Over the next several weeks, Captain Nemo shows Ned, Aronnax and Conseil around his submarine from its power station (an early type of atomic reactor which powers the sub), and the various ways the sub runs. Nemo allows his three ""guests"" to come and go around the Nautilus, but forbids them from trying to escape. Nemo takes the Nautilus on a series of adventures to various places in the Pacific and Aronnaux is both impressed and unsettled by Nemo's free-spirited thoughts of the world and places and islands they visit to gather food and supplies for the crew.Ned makes friends with a sea lion pet of Nemo's whom he spends most of his time with while in his cabin and wondering through the submarine.Nemo takes Aronnax to the penal colony island of Rura Penthe. Nemo reveals he was once a prisoner there, as were many of his crew. The prisoners are loading an ammunition ship. That evening, the Nautilus rams and sinks the ship at sea, destroying its cargo and killing all its crew. An anguished Nemo tells Arronax that his actions have saved thousands from death in war; he also discloses that this ""hated nation"" tortured his wife and son to death while attempting to force from him the secrets of his advanced work.While the crew repair some damage to the Nautilus' rudder caused by the sinking of the merchant ship, Ned and Conseil sneak into Nemo's cabin and discover the coordinates of Nemo's secret base, a small island called Vulcania. After writing down the coordinates and sneaking out of the room, Ned writes out and releases several messages in bottles containing the island's isolated location, hoping somebody will find and free them from captivity.One day while off the coast of New Guinea, the Nautilus becomes stranded on a reef. Ned is surprised when Nemo allows him to go ashore with Conseil unescorted, ostensibly to collect wildlife specimens. Ned goes off alone to explore avenues of escape. While kneeling at a pool to drink some water, he sees a number of human skulls on stakes. Realizing his danger, Ned runs for his life and rejoins Conseil as they are chased back to the Nautilus by cannibal natives. Despite remaining aground, Nemo is unconcerned, and the cannibals are repelled from the ship by electrical charges through the outer hull. Nemo is furious with Ned for not following his orders to stay on the beach and confines him to the submarine's brig.Just then, a warship approaches, firing on the Nautilus. After a cannon shot hits the submarine, it slides off the reef and down into the depths, where it attracts the attention of a giant squid. An electric hull charge fails to repel the creature, so Nemo and his men surface during a violent storm to dislodge the beast. Nemo is quickly caught in one of the squid's tentacles. Ned, having escaped from captivity during the struggle, harpoons the creature, killing it, and jumps to Nemo's rescue, saving his captor from drowning as the dead squid sinks away. As a result, Nemo has a change of heart and decides to make peace with the outside world.As the Nautilus nears Vulcania, Nemo finds the island surrounded by warships, whose marines are converging on his hidden base in an interior lagoon. Nemo navigates the Nautilus through an underwater channel to the lagoon where his base it. As Nemo goes ashore alone, armed marines appear on the ridge and attack. Ned attempts to identify himself as the author of the bottled messages, but they do not appear to hear him. Aronnax realizes this and becomes furious at Ned, recognizing that Nemo will soon destroy all evidence of his discoveries. Nemo triggers a time bomb in his large complex, but is badly wounded from a rifle bullet to his back while returning to the Nautilus.

From a safe distance away aboard the Nautilus' lifeboat skiff, Ted, Aronnaux, Conseil and Nemo's pet sea lion witness Vulcania destroyed by an enormous atomic-like explosion, and Ned apologizes to Aronnax for hitting him. As the now adrift Nautilus is swamped by the tsunami waves caused by the explosions, it disappears beneath the waves, as Nemo's last words to Aronnax echo: ""There is hope for the future.

A lone print fround in front of the little girl's trailer is sent to the FBI in Washington for identification. Dr. Medford and his daughter Dr. Pat Medford come to New Mexico after identifying the print as belonging to a species of ant that had mutated after the first atomic bombing 9 years before in 1945. They find and destroy the New Mexico nest but not in time to prevent two young queen ants from escaping. One of the ants starts a nest on a military ship at sea. After the ants kill the entire crew the ship is sunk and the invading ants are killed. Another ant makes her way to the drain system of Los Angeles. A father and his two young boys accidently come upon one off the ants. The father is killed and then a hunt is on to see if they are in time to save the two young boys and also destroy the nest before any other ant can escape and destroy the world as we know it. Top notch entertainment!=================================================================In the desert of New Mexico, a young girl wandering along a road in shock is found by two state troopers. When she's brought to the police station, she's identified and the police officers decide to investigate the home where she lives with her parents and brother. One side of the house has been smashed down and the place is nearly destroyed. One of the troopers hears a bizarre ringing noise outside and walks around the back of the house to find the source. The man screams, fires a few shots and is silent, attacked and killed by an unseen enemy.At the police station the young girl meets a scientist who has her smell a pungent substance. She becomes instantly terrified, backing into a corner and screaming the word ""THEM!!!""=================================================================Title (Note: the movie is black and white but the title is in color - red and blue) and credits run over a desert vista with a large desert tree in the foreground. We see a spotter aircraft fly over the desert. Johnny (an uncredited John Close) calls the car below to report something. A little girl is seen wandering in the desert. Johnny circles until the police car arrives. The girl (Sandy Descher) is dressed in a bathrobe and carrying a doll. Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) exits the car to retrieve the child. She is in shock and unresponsive to commands. Trooper Ed Blackburn (Chris Drake) takes a call from the airplane pilot. Johnny has spotted a trailer about three miles down the road. Ben and Ed take the girl and drive down the road to investigate the trailer. They discover the trailer has sustained structural damage but there is no evidence of fire or an explosion. No money has been taken and blood stains are estimated to be less than twelve hours old. Ben finds a piece of cloth and plastic. Ed finds some sugar cubes. A mysterious print in the sand piques their curiosity. Ben matches the cloth from the little girl's bathrobe and the plastic piece fits the missing piece of her doll's head. An ambulance is called and a police team goes over the crime scene. The ambulance attendant (an uncredited William Schallert) assures Ben he'll take good care of the child. They hear a weird chirping noise like crickets, but do not notice the Ellinson girl respond to the sound. They attribute the sound to the wind. Ben asks Cliff (an uncredited Cliff Ferre), who is finishing the plaster moulage on the strange print, what he thinks it might be. The ambulance departs, so Ben and Ed decide to visit the local store run by Gramps Johnson (an uncredited Mathew McCue). They want to know if he knows anything.It is early evening when Ben and Ed arrive at the store. The wind is howling and the store is a shambles. They investigate and discover there is no sign of robbery, but a twisted shotgun indicates Gramps fought off his attackers. They find his dead body in a storage area below the store. Outside the two officers hear a noise. They notice the wall has been pulled away, just like at the trailer. A large barrel of sugar has been turned over. Ben exits the store and leaves Ed to remain until the investigation team arrives. Ed hears the weird chirping sound and goes outside to investigate. We only hear the confrontation -- six shots from Ed's service revolver and a scream.At police headquarters the clues from both scenes are spread out on the table in the office of Capt. Fred Edwards (Don Shelton). They are stumped to make any sense from the clues, including the strange plaster print. They do get a match on fingerprints from the trailer. The Ellinson family was on an extended vacation and the father was an FBI agent. Robert Graham (James Arness), an FBI agent from the office in Alamogordo, joins the investigation. Bob Graham is also stumped. Bob suggests sending the print to Washington for identification. The coroner, Doc. Putnam (an uncredited Joseph Forte) arrives and provides five causes of death. He tells them, ""Johnson could have died in one of five ways; His neck and back were broken, his chest was crushed, his skull was fractured...and here's one for Sherlock Holmes: There was enough formic acid in him to kill twenty men.""Bob Graham receives a telegram from the Bureau telling him to meet Doctors Medford at the airport and extend all cooperation. The FBI was unable to identify the print and sent it to the Department of Agriculture. A military transport, an old North American B-25 Mitchell, arrives and the first out is Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn). He is short, plump, and slightly distracted in his own thoughts. Next off the plane is Dr. Medford's daughter, Patricia (Joan Weldon). She is tall, brunette, and very attractive and prefers to be called Pat. Bob Graham immediately takes a shine to this scientist. The four return to police headquarters. The Medfords review the clues and read all the reports. Dr. Medford asks where exactly the first atomic bomb in 1945 was exploded. He is told in the same general area. Dr. Medford thinks out loud, ""1945. That's nine years ago. Yes, genetically its certainly possible."" Bob wants to know what they suspect, but Dr. Medford refuses to explain until he and his daughter are certain of their theory. Dr. Medford wants to stop at a drug store and visit the Ellinson girl at the hospital, then revisit the location where the print was found.At the hospital, Medford examines the girl and consults with the psychiatrist (an uncredited Ann Doran). A small glass filled with formic acid causes the girl to react. She runs and tries to hide while screaming, ""Them! Them!"" The four exit the hospital room and visit the trailer site. The wind is howling and the blowing sand and dust make it hard to see and hear each other. Pat remarks that, ""Rather slim pickings for food, Dad. They'd turn carnivorous for lack of a habitual diet."" Medford agrees, then walks away. Bob wants to know what they are talking about and gets rather insistent. Pat refuses to cooperate, but explains to Bob that her father is an expert myrmecologist, and will tell him when they are sure. Medford discovers a print, and measuring it determines the creature would be over eight feet long. Pat wanders off to find more prints. She discovers one, then she hears the weird chirping sound. It intensifies and the source reveals itself as a giant ant. She screams and backs away. Bob comes to her rescue firing his revolver at the creature, but with little effect. Medford yells they should aim for the antenne, as they are helpless without them. Ben retrieves a machine gun from the police car and fires enough bullets into the creature to kill it. They all approach to get a closer look at the insect. When asked what it is, Medford replies, ""Species appears to be Camponotus Vicinus. One of the family Formicidae. An Ant."" Medford speculates that radiation caused this mutation.General O'Brien (Onslow Stevens), Ben and Medford are aboard a helicopter searching the desert for the nest of the giant ants. Aboard a second helicopter is Bob, Pat, and Major Kibbee (Sean McClory). They are also searching for the nest in another sector. Pat admits she is worried about her father. Pat finds what she is looking for -- a cone shaped mound with a large opening on top. They circle the mound and see an ant remove a human rib cage and throw it into a pile. Human skulls, a police belt with bullets and other bones are littered at the base of the mound. Pat proclaims, ""You've just found your missing persons.""In an FBI office, General O'Brien confronts Dr. Medford about his inconsistency. Medford insists secrecy is paramount and that time is the most important thing. O'Brien is anxious to bomb the nest and be done with the affair. Medford explains that the ants won't be in the nest at night. He proposes to attack them during the day with poison gas, then examine the nest to verify all are dead. During the hottest part of the next day, O'Brien and Ben fire a bazooka with phosphorus shells onto the mound to keep the area hot and the ants below. Bob Graham and Maj. Kibbee also lace the mound with incendiary shells. The Medfords watch and wait. Bob and Ben approach the opening with cyanide gas grenades. A worker ant is seen trying to escape the nest and is held off with a machine gun. The two men bombard the nest with the gas grenades.Bob and Ben prepare to enter the nest. Pat approaches dressed for a subterranean exploration. She tells the men she will accompany them. Bob objects, but Pat explains, ""Someone with scientific knowledge has to go. My father is physically unable to do it. That leaves me."" Bob reluctantly agrees and the three descend into the nest. At first, all they find are dead ants. Further along and down, they are surprised when a wall begins to collapse and they are confronted by some live ants. They are quickly dispatched with Ben's flamethrower. In the queen's chamber, Pat is disappointed to discover they are too late. Without explaining, she takes a few photographs then orders the contents burned. Ben torches all the eggs and dead adult worker ants.Dr. Medford explains that the empty egg cases contained queen ants, which will set up new nests. The team goes to Washington, D.C. to brief a panel of military and government personnel. Medford shows them a film about ants to give them some idea of what they face in combating the insects. Medford punctuates his presentation with a warning if they cannot be stopped, ""Man, as the dominant species of life on Earth will probably be extinct within a year."" A collection center for information is established and all reports of strange phenomena are funneled through same. An Air Force Sergeant (an uncredited Leonard Nimoy) pulls a dispatch off a teletype machine and hands it to a woman to classify. The note refers to a pilot, Alan Crotty, crashing his airplane after witnessing UFOs shaped like ants. He confirms that everything in the building is top secret. Bob and Pat review the dispatch and fly to Brownsville, Texas with Maj. Kibbee to investigate the Crotty report.Alan Crotty (Fess Parker) reluctantly tells his story to what he perceives as an unbelieving audience. Bob, Pat and Kibbee listen and ask a few questions. The three exit Crotty's room and speak with the doctor. Bob tells the doctor to keep Crotty confined. Back in Washington, the Medfords and Bob Graham review what they know so far. Medford takes a call and rushes to the communications room. O'Brien is there and directs Medford to an incoming message. The U.S.S. Viking reports a nest of ants hatched aboard their ship at sea. Only two survivors are rescued by the Navy. The Viking was ordered sunk by Naval gunfire. The Medfords conclude a queen flew aboard and hatched a nest while the ship was anchored in Acapulco, Mexico for the three days and four nights it was there. An official at the meeting (an uncredited Willis Bouchey) is convinced the public should be notified of the danger, but the consensus is to keep things secret to avoid panic. Pat reports that Kibbee, Ben and Bob are in Los Angeles investigating a lead -- the theft of forty tons of sugar.It is Sunday morning and Ben and Bob talk to the rail yard detective (an uncredited Dick Wessel). He reports that the rail car was broken into on Friday night and the yard watchman is being held as a suspect. At police headquarters Bob questions the yard watchman (an uncredited Dub Taylor). Ben was questioning Mrs. Lodge (Mary Alan Hokanson) about the death of her husband. Bob and Ben go to the morgue to see the body and talk to the coroner (an uncredited Russell Gaige). The coroner explains, ""I don't think this happened in a machine."" The missing arm and laceration on the chest are curious. He attributes death to shock and loss of blood. Lodge was with his two children, but he was found alone in his car without any trace of the arm. Bob questions Mrs. Lodge but she tells him she has no clue where her husband took the children that morning. Ben interrupts the interrogation to question patrolmen Ryan (an uncredited John Beradino) and Sutton (an uncredited Robert Berger). They found Thomas Lodge. They show Bob and Ben on the map of the city where they found the body. Bob and Ben interview the four people cited by the officers three drunks and a speeding ticket. A blonde floozy (an uncredited Mary Lou Holloway) is questioned and released. Two of the three drunks are returned to the tank to sleep it off. Ryan explains that the third drunk is at the hospital in the alcoholic ward.The ward doctor (an uncredited Grandon Rhodes) escorts Kibbee, Bob and Ben to see Jensen (Olin Howlin). Jensen tells them that he saw a little airplane and large ants down in the open storm drain channel. Bob comments that the openings look like they may be worth investigating. Jensen's loud outburst disturbs the alcoholic in the next bed (an uncredited Harry Wilson) who pleads, ""Please, my nerves!"" Ryan drives Bob, Ben and Kibbee down onto the river bed. They search the area and find a model airplane. Kibbee finds an ant print, which confirms the drunk's story.A news conference is called on Sunday evening. General O'Brien makes the announcement, ""By direction of the President of the United States, in full agreement with the Governor of the State of California, and the Mayor of Los Angeles. The city of Los Angeles is, in the interest of public safety, hereby proclaimed to be under martial law. Curfew is at 1800 hours. Any persons on the street or outside their quarters after 6:00 p.m. tonight will be subject to arrest by the military police."" O'Brien explains what prompted such drastic action. He explains that giant ants were discovered in New Mexico and a nest has been established in the storm drains under the city of Los Angeles. The military begins to stage for the attack. A field headquarters is established outside the storm drain opening where the model airplane and print was discovered. Search units in Jeeps proceed into the storm drains. About a mile in, Ben hears something and requests all engines be stopped. He investigates a pipe that leads to a section still under construction. He finds Mike Lodge (an uncredited Richard Bellis) and his brother Jerry Lodge (an uncredited Robert Scott Correll) trapped and about to be attacked by the ants. Ben kills the ants with his flamethrower. He rescues the boys and sends them down a pipe back to the safety of his waiting driver, Smitty (an uncredited Joel Smith). Unfortunately his own escape is thwarted. An ant grabs Ben with its mandibles and crushes him to death. All units are sent to Drain 267 to engage the enemy. O'Brien and Dr. Medford drive to the location. Bob, and a unit of soldiers fight their way to the nest area, killing many ants with gunfire. O'Brien and Medford arrive and order a cease fire. A section of tunnel collapses trapping Bob inside with the ants. Soldiers dig away the rubble and reach Bob before he is killed by the ants guarding the nest of newly hatched queens. All the worker ants protecting the nest are killed. Medford is called and examines the nest. He says, ""This is the egg chamber. I'm certain no new queens have escaped from this nest. The job will be done when these are destroyed."" O'Brien orders, ""Okay, burn them out."" Flamethrowers destroy the winged queen and consort ants. Dr. Medford waxes philosophical, ""When man entered the atomic age, he opened a door into a new world. What we'll eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict."" We close with a slow zoom in shot of the ants on fire, some still moving.","

They also find that kindly old Gramps Johnson who ran the local store was also killed in a mysterious way. A lone print fround in front of the little girl's trailer is sent to the FBI in Washington for identification. Dr. Medford and his daughter Dr. Pat Medford come to New Mexico after identifying the print as belonging to a species of ant that had mutated after the first atomic bombing 9 years before in 1945. They find and destroy the New Mexico nest but not in time to prevent two young queen ants from escaping. One of the ants starts a nest on a military ship at sea. After the ants kill the entire crew the ship is sunk and the invading ants are killed. Another ant makes her way to the drain system of Los Angeles. A father and his two young boys accidently come upon one off the ants. The father is killed and then a hunt is on to see if they are in time to save the two young boys and also destroy the nest before any other ant can escape and destroy the world as we know it. Top notch entertainment!=================================================================In the desert of New Mexico, a young girl wandering along a road in shock is found by two state troopers. When she's brought to the police station, she's identified and the police officers decide to investigate the home where she lives with her parents and brother. One side of the house has been smashed down and the place is nearly destroyed. One of the troopers hears a bizarre ringing noise outside and walks around the back of the house to find the source. The man screams, fires a few shots and is silent, attacked and killed by an unseen enemy.At the police station the young girl meets a scientist who has her smell a pungent substance. She becomes instantly terrified, backing into a corner and screaming the word ""THEM!!!""=================================================================Title (Note: the movie is black and white but the title is in color - red and blue) and credits run over a desert vista with a large desert tree in the foreground. We see a spotter aircraft fly over the desert. Johnny (an uncredited John Close) calls the car below to report something. A little girl is seen wandering in the desert. Johnny circles until the police car arrives. The girl (Sandy Descher) is dressed in a bathrobe and carrying a doll. Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) exits the car to retrieve the child. She is in shock and unresponsive to commands. Trooper Ed Blackburn (Chris Drake) takes a call from the airplane pilot. Johnny has spotted a trailer about three miles down the road. Ben and Ed take the girl and drive down the road to investigate the trailer. They discover the trailer has sustained structural damage but there is no evidence of fire or an explosion. No money has been taken and blood stains are estimated to be less than twelve hours old. Ben finds a piece of cloth and plastic. Ed finds some sugar cubes. A mysterious print in the sand piques their curiosity. Ben matches the cloth from the little girl's bathrobe and the plastic piece fits the missing piece of her doll's head. An ambulance is called and a police team goes over the crime scene. The ambulance attendant (an uncredited William Schallert) assures Ben he'll take good care of the child. They hear a weird chirping noise like crickets, but do not notice the Ellinson girl respond to the sound. They attribute the sound to the wind. Ben asks Cliff (an uncredited Cliff Ferre), who is finishing the plaster moulage on the strange print, what he thinks it might be. The ambulance departs, so Ben and Ed decide to visit the local store run by Gramps Johnson (an uncredited Mathew McCue). They want to know if he knows anything.It is early evening when Ben and Ed arrive at the store. The wind is howling and the store is a shambles. They investigate and discover there is no sign of robbery, but a twisted shotgun indicates Gramps fought off his attackers. They find his dead body in a storage area below the store. Outside the two officers hear a noise. They notice the wall has been pulled away, just like at the trailer. A large barrel of sugar has been turned over. Ben exits the store and leaves Ed to remain until the investigation team arrives. Ed hears the weird chirping sound and goes outside to investigate. We only hear the confrontation -- six shots from Ed's service revolver and a scream.At police headquarters the clues from both scenes are spread out on the table in the office of Capt. Fred Edwards (Don Shelton). They are stumped to make any sense from the clues, including the strange plaster print. They do get a match on fingerprints from the trailer. The Ellinson family was on an extended vacation and the father was an FBI agent. Robert Graham (James Arness), an FBI agent from the office in Alamogordo, joins the investigation. Bob Graham is also stumped. Bob suggests sending the print to Washington for identification. The coroner, Doc. Putnam (an uncredited Joseph Forte) arrives and provides five causes of death. He tells them, ""Johnson could have died in one of five ways; His neck and back were broken, his chest was crushed, his skull was fractured...and here's one for Sherlock Holmes: There was enough formic acid in him to kill twenty men.""Bob Graham receives a telegram from the Bureau telling him to meet Doctors Medford at the airport and extend all cooperation. The FBI was unable to identify the print and sent it to the Department of Agriculture. A military transport, an old North American B-25 Mitchell, arrives and the first out is Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn). He is short, plump, and slightly distracted in his own thoughts. Next off the plane is Dr. Medford's daughter, Patricia (Joan Weldon). She is tall, brunette, and very attractive and prefers to be called Pat. Bob Graham immediately takes a shine to this scientist. The four return to police headquarters. The Medfords review the clues and read all the reports. Dr. Medford asks where exactly the first atomic bomb in 1945 was exploded. He is told in the same general area. Dr. Medford thinks out loud, ""1945. That's nine years ago. Yes, genetically its certainly possible."" Bob wants to know what they suspect, but Dr. Medford refuses to explain until he and his daughter are certain of their theory. Dr. Medford wants to stop at a drug store and visit the Ellinson girl at the hospital, then revisit the location where the print was found.At the hospital, Medford examines the girl and consults with the psychiatrist (an uncredited Ann Doran). A small glass filled with formic acid causes the girl to react. She runs and tries to hide while screaming, ""Them! Them!"" The four exit the hospital room and visit the trailer site. The wind is howling and the blowing sand and dust make it hard to see and hear each other. Pat remarks that, ""Rather slim pickings for food, Dad. They'd turn carnivorous for lack of a habitual diet."" Medford agrees, then walks away. Bob wants to know what they are talking about and gets rather insistent. Pat refuses to cooperate, but explains to Bob that her father is an expert myrmecologist, and will tell him when they are sure. Medford discovers a print, and measuring it determines the creature would be over eight feet long. Pat wanders off to find more prints. She discovers one, then she hears the weird chirping sound. It intensifies and the source reveals itself as a giant ant. She screams and backs away. Bob comes to her rescue firing his revolver at the creature, but with little effect. Medford yells they should aim for the antenne, as they are helpless without them. Ben retrieves a machine gun from the police car and fires enough bullets into the creature to kill it. They all approach to get a closer look at the insect. When asked what it is, Medford replies, ""Species appears to be Camponotus Vicinus. One of the family Formicidae. An Ant."" Medford speculates that radiation caused this mutation.General O'Brien (Onslow Stevens), Ben and Medford are aboard a helicopter searching the desert for the nest of the giant ants. Aboard a second helicopter is Bob, Pat, and Major Kibbee (Sean McClory). They are also searching for the nest in another sector. Pat admits she is worried about her father. Pat finds what she is looking for -- a cone shaped mound with a large opening on top. They circle the mound and see an ant remove a human rib cage and throw it into a pile. Human skulls, a police belt with bullets and other bones are littered at the base of the mound. Pat proclaims, ""You've just found your missing persons.""In an FBI office, General O'Brien confronts Dr. Medford about his inconsistency. Medford insists secrecy is paramount and that time is the most important thing. O'Brien is anxious to bomb the nest and be done with the affair. Medford explains that the ants won't be in the nest at night. He proposes to attack them during the day with poison gas, then examine the nest to verify all are dead. During the hottest part of the next day, O'Brien and Ben fire a bazooka with phosphorus shells onto the mound to keep the area hot and the ants below. Bob Graham and Maj. Kibbee also lace the mound with incendiary shells. The Medfords watch and wait. Bob and Ben approach the opening with cyanide gas grenades. A worker ant is seen trying to escape the nest and is held off with a machine gun. The two men bombard the nest with the gas grenades.Bob and Ben prepare to enter the nest. Pat approaches dressed for a subterranean exploration. She tells the men she will accompany them. Bob objects, but Pat explains, ""Someone with scientific knowledge has to go. My father is physically unable to do it. That leaves me."" Bob reluctantly agrees and the three descend into the nest. At first, all they find are dead ants. Further along and down, they are surprised when a wall begins to collapse and they are confronted by some live ants. They are quickly dispatched with Ben's flamethrower. In the queen's chamber, Pat is disappointed to discover they are too late. Without explaining, she takes a few photographs then orders the contents burned. Ben torches all the eggs and dead adult worker ants.Dr. Medford explains that the empty egg cases contained queen ants, which will set up new nests. The team goes to Washington, D.C. to brief a panel of military and government personnel. Medford shows them a film about ants to give them some idea of what they face in combating the insects. Medford punctuates his presentation with a warning if they cannot be stopped, ""Man, as the dominant species of life on Earth will probably be extinct within a year."" A collection center for information is established and all reports of strange phenomena are funneled through same. An Air Force Sergeant (an uncredited Leonard Nimoy) pulls a dispatch off a teletype machine and hands it to a woman to classify. The note refers to a pilot, Alan Crotty, crashing his airplane after witnessing UFOs shaped like ants. He confirms that everything in the building is top secret. Bob and Pat review the dispatch and fly to Brownsville, Texas with Maj. Kibbee to investigate the Crotty report.Alan Crotty (Fess Parker) reluctantly tells his story to what he perceives as an unbelieving audience. Bob, Pat and Kibbee listen and ask a few questions. The three exit Crotty's room and speak with the doctor. Bob tells the doctor to keep Crotty confined. Back in Washington, the Medfords and Bob Graham review what they know so far. Medford takes a call and rushes to the communications room. O'Brien is there and directs Medford to an incoming message. The U.S.S. Viking reports a nest of ants hatched aboard their ship at sea. Only two survivors are rescued by the Navy. The Viking was ordered sunk by Naval gunfire. The Medfords conclude a queen flew aboard and hatched a nest while the ship was anchored in Acapulco, Mexico for the three days and four nights it was there. An official at the meeting (an uncredited Willis Bouchey) is convinced the public should be notified of the danger, but the consensus is to keep things secret to avoid panic. Pat reports that Kibbee, Ben and Bob are in Los Angeles investigating a lead -- the theft of forty tons of sugar.It is Sunday morning and Ben and Bob talk to the rail yard detective (an uncredited Dick Wessel). He reports that the rail car was broken into on Friday night and the yard watchman is being held as a suspect. At police headquarters Bob questions the yard watchman (an uncredited Dub Taylor). Ben was questioning Mrs. Lodge (Mary Alan Hokanson) about the death of her husband. Bob and Ben go to the morgue to see the body and talk to the coroner (an uncredited Russell Gaige). The coroner explains, ""I don't think this happened in a machine."" The missing arm and laceration on the chest are curious. He attributes death to shock and loss of blood. Lodge was with his two children, but he was found alone in his car without any trace of the arm. Bob questions Mrs. Lodge but she tells him she has no clue where her husband took the children that morning. Ben interrupts the interrogation to question patrolmen Ryan (an uncredited John Beradino) and Sutton (an uncredited Robert Berger). They found Thomas Lodge. They show Bob and Ben on the map of the city where they found the body. Bob and Ben interview the four people cited by the officers three drunks and a speeding ticket. A blonde floozy (an uncredited Mary Lou Holloway) is questioned and released. Two of the three drunks are returned to the tank to sleep it off. Ryan explains that the third drunk is at the hospital in the alcoholic ward.The ward doctor (an uncredited Grandon Rhodes) escorts Kibbee, Bob and Ben to see Jensen (Olin Howlin). Jensen tells them that he saw a little airplane and large ants down in the open storm drain channel. Bob comments that the openings look like they may be worth investigating. Jensen's loud outburst disturbs the alcoholic in the next bed (an uncredited Harry Wilson) who pleads, ""Please, my nerves!"" Ryan drives Bob, Ben and Kibbee down onto the river bed. They search the area and find a model airplane. Kibbee finds an ant print, which confirms the drunk's story.A news conference is called on Sunday evening. General O'Brien makes the announcement, ""By direction of the President of the United States, in full agreement with the Governor of the State of California, and the Mayor of Los Angeles. The city of Los Angeles is, in the interest of public safety, hereby proclaimed to be under martial law. Curfew is at 1800 hours. Any persons on the street or outside their quarters after 6:00 p.m. tonight will be subject to arrest by the military police."" O'Brien explains what prompted such drastic action. He explains that giant ants were discovered in New Mexico and a nest has been established in the storm drains under the city of Los Angeles. The military begins to stage for the attack. A field headquarters is established outside the storm drain opening where the model airplane and print was discovered. Search units in Jeeps proceed into the storm drains. About a mile in, Ben hears something and requests all engines be stopped. He investigates a pipe that leads to a section still under construction. He finds Mike Lodge (an uncredited Richard Bellis) and his brother Jerry Lodge (an uncredited Robert Scott Correll) trapped and about to be attacked by the ants. Ben kills the ants with his flamethrower. He rescues the boys and sends them down a pipe back to the safety of his waiting driver, Smitty (an uncredited Joel Smith). Unfortunately his own escape is thwarted. An ant grabs Ben with its mandibles and crushes him to death. All units are sent to Drain 267 to engage the enemy. O'Brien and Dr. Medford drive to the location. Bob, and a unit of soldiers fight their way to the nest area, killing many ants with gunfire. O'Brien and Medford arrive and order a cease fire. A section of tunnel collapses trapping Bob inside with the ants. Soldiers dig away the rubble and reach Bob before he is killed by the ants guarding the nest of newly hatched queens. All the worker ants protecting the nest are killed. Medford is called and examines the nest. He says, ""This is the egg chamber. I'm certain no new queens have escaped from this nest. The job will be done when these are destroyed."" O'Brien orders, ""Okay, burn them out."" Flamethrowers destroy the winged queen and consort ants. Dr. Medford waxes philosophical, ""When man entered the atomic age, he opened a door into a new world. What we'll eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict."" We close with a slow zoom in shot of the ants on fire, some still moving.

"16","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047834/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Manor Farm is a former prosperous farm that has fallen on hard times, and suffers under the now ineffective leadership of its drunken and aggressive owner, Mr. Jones. One night, Old Major, the prize boar and the second-oldest on the farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to parasites and encourages them to break free from their tyrant's influence, while reminding them that they must hold true to their convictions after they have gained freedom. With that, he teaches the animals a revolutionary song, ""Beasts of England"", before collapsing dead mid-song to the animals' horror.The next morning, Jones neglects to feed the animals for breakfast, and they decide to break into the storehouse to help themselves. When Jones wakes up and attempts to intimidate them with his whip, the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible Mr. Jones from the farm, renaming it ""Animal Farm"". They set to work destroying every trace of Jones' influence, mainly the weapons used against them. An investigation of the farmhouse leads them to concede against living there, though one of the head pigs, a boar named Napoleon, who is the film's antagonist, takes interest in the abandoned house, and even more so in a litter of puppies left motherless.The Seven Commandments of Animalism are written on the wall of a barn to illustrate their community's laws. The most important is the seventh, ""All animals are equal."" All the animals work, but the workhorse, Boxer, and his friend Benjamin, the young donkey and the film's protoganist, put in extra work. A young pig named Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon takes the pups and trains them privately.When Snowball announces his idea for a windmill, Napoleon opposes it. Snowball makes a speech in favor of the windmill, whereupon Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away. In Snowball's absence, Napoleon declares himself leader and makes changes. Meetings will no longer be held and instead a committee of pigs will run the farm. Using a young pig named Squealer as a mouthpiece, Napoleon spurs the animals into setting forth his regime. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill.Napoleon abuses his powers, making life harder for the animals; the pigs impose more control while reserving privileges for themselves. During this time, the pigs also decide to start altering their own laws. ""No animal shall sleep in beds"" is changed to ""No animal shall sleep in beds with sheets"" when the pigs are discovered to have been sleeping in the old farmhouse. ""No animal shall drink alcohol"" is changed to ""No animal shall drink alcohol to excess"" when the pigs discover the farmer's whisky. Despite this, most animals keep believing that the pigs are acting in the best interest of all animals.Before long, Napoleon's greed drives him to negotiate with a local trader named Mr. Whymper for a supply of jellies and jams. The price is all the hens' eggs. When the hens discover this, they attempt to revolt by throwing their eggs at the pigs during an attempted seize by force. To instill fear, Napoleon not only puts the hens at the hands of the pig committee, but also selects a duck and sheep to be false accused of treachery. They are taken outside and murdered by the dogs, with their blood used to edit a commandment regarding killing to being legal ""with cause"". ""Beasts of England"" is banned as inappropriate, as according to Napoleon, the dream of Animal Farm has been realized.Growing jealous of Whymper's financial success due to his trading with Animal Farm, a hostile group of farmers attacks the farm, and Jones, who was denied the chance to rejoin them, uses blasting powder to blow up the windmill with himself inside. Though the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer, are wounded. Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses one night while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to a vetinarian. Benjamin notices that the van belongs to Mr. Whymper's glue factory, and attempts to mount a rescue. However, his attempts are futile and Boxer is taken away, presumably to his death. Squealer delivers a phony speech, claiming to have been at Boxer's side at his deathbed, and his last words being to glorify Napoleon. He also dismisses any claim that Boxer was sold in exchange for money.

                    Britain's second animated feature, which, despite the title and Disney-esque animal animation, is in fact a no-holds-barred adaptation of George Orwell's classic satire on Stalinism, with the animals taking over their farm by means of a revolutionary coup, but then discovering that although all animals are supposed to be equal, some are more equal than others...

The animals are tired of being under the cruel hand of Farmer Jones (Czar Nicholas II), so Old Major (Karl Marx), a pig, leads a meeting declaring that man is their enemy. But when Major dies, the animals lead a successful revolt against Farmer Jones, and the animals rename Manor Farm ""Animal Farm"" and have their own laws. Snowball (Leon Trotsky) becomes the first president, but Napoleon (Joseph Stalin) oust him, and Napoleon and his accomplice, Squealer (propagandist) break countless rules, use TV as propaganda to warp the animals' minds, and even side with the humans! And the rules are changed, showing that all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others. Will the animals stop Napoleon, or will his downfall be soon

    Synopsis
    Manor Farm is a former prosperous farm that has fallen on hard times, and suffers under the now ineffective leadership of its drunken and aggressive owner, Mr. Jones. One night, Old Major, the prize boar and the second-oldest on the farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to parasites and encourages them to break free from their tyrant's influence, while reminding them that they must hold true to their convictions after they have gained freedom. With that, he teaches the animals a revolutionary song, ""Beasts of England"", before collapsing dead mid-song to the animals' horror.The next morning, Jones neglects to feed the animals for breakfast, and they decide to break into the storehouse to help themselves. When Jones wakes up and attempts to intimidate them with his whip, the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible Mr. Jones from the farm, renaming it ""Animal Farm"". They set to work destroying every trace of Jones' influence, mainly the weapons used against them. An investigation of the farmhouse leads them to concede against living there, though one of the head pigs, a boar named Napoleon, who is the film's antagonist, takes interest in the abandoned house, and even more so in a litter of puppies left motherless.The Seven Commandments of Animalism are written on the wall of a barn to illustrate their community's laws. The most important is the seventh, ""All animals are equal."" All the animals work, but the workhorse, Boxer, and his friend Benjamin, the young donkey and the film's protoganist, put in extra work. A young pig named Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon takes the pups and trains them privately.When Snowball announces his idea for a windmill, Napoleon opposes it. Snowball makes a speech in favor of the windmill, whereupon Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away. In Snowball's absence, Napoleon declares himself leader and makes changes. Meetings will no longer be held and instead a committee of pigs will run the farm. Using a young pig named Squealer as a mouthpiece, Napoleon spurs the animals into setting forth his regime. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill.Napoleon abuses his powers, making life harder for the animals; the pigs impose more control while reserving privileges for themselves. During this time, the pigs also decide to start altering their own laws. ""No animal shall sleep in beds"" is changed to ""No animal shall sleep in beds with sheets"" when the pigs are discovered to have been sleeping in the old farmhouse. ""No animal shall drink alcohol"" is changed to ""No animal shall drink alcohol to excess"" when the pigs discover the farmer's whisky. Despite this, most animals keep believing that the pigs are acting in the best interest of all animals.Before long, Napoleon's greed drives him to negotiate with a local trader named Mr. Whymper for a supply of jellies and jams. The price is all the hens' eggs. When the hens discover this, they attempt to revolt by throwing their eggs at the pigs during an attempted seize by force. To instill fear, Napoleon not only puts the hens at the hands of the pig committee, but also selects a duck and sheep to be false accused of treachery. They are taken outside and murdered by the dogs, with their blood used to edit a commandment regarding killing to being legal ""with cause"". ""Beasts of England"" is banned as inappropriate, as according to Napoleon, the dream of Animal Farm has been realized.Growing jealous of Whymper's financial success due to his trading with Animal Farm, a hostile group of farmers attacks the farm, and Jones, who was denied the chance to rejoin them, uses blasting powder to blow up the windmill with himself inside. Though the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer, are wounded. Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses one night while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to a vetinarian. Benjamin notices that the van belongs to Mr. Whymper's glue factory, and attempts to mount a rescue. However, his attempts are futile and Boxer is taken away, presumably to his death. Squealer delivers a phony speech, claiming to have been at Boxer's side at his deathbed, and his last words being to glorify Napoleon. He also dismisses any claim that Boxer was sold in exchange for money. The hurt animals fully realize that Boxer's death was planned simply to promote further loyalty to Napoleon's dictatorship, but are sent away by the snarling dogs.Years pass, and the pigs now have learned to walk upright and wear clothes. Napoleon now dresses in a suit with medals (a reference to Nikita Khrushchev). The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single phrase: ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."" Napoleon holds a dinner party for a delegation of outside pigs, who congratulate Napoleon on having the hardest-working animals in the country on the least feed. Napoleon gives a toast to when pigs own and operate farms everywhere.Benjamin, overhearing the conversation, imagines the faces of the pigs changing into the face of Mr. Jones. Realizing that things have become ""worse then ever for ordinary creature"", all of the animals unite together to overthrow Napoleon. The film closes with a smashed portrait of Napoleon as he is being overwhelmed by the animals and beaten to death.

Further, it is the wedding day of her younger sister and they are invited to stay to the party. Meanwhile Tommy and Fiona fall in love with each other. Later Tommy and the skeptical Jeff discover that a local preacher had prayed to God in the Eighteenth Century asking for a miracle to protect Brigadoon from witches that lived in Scotland. From that day on, when the locals go to sleep in the night, they wake up 100 years later. However, if a dweller leaves Brigadoon, the town and the citizens would all disappear forever.

                    Three American women, rooming together while working abroad in Rome, Italy, hope for romance and marriage. Frances, oldest of the three, has been fifteen years a secretary to novelist John Frederick Shadwell, a man whom she loves but whose reclusive nature prompts most people to believe him long since dead. Anita, one week away from returning to America (under the claim of getting married), finally bucks company rules (and gets caught) by finally accepting an invitation from an Italian co-worker to visit his family's farm for his sister's wedding. Newly arrived Maria soon sets her generally innocent eyes on Dino di Cessi, an actual prince with a reputation for womanizing, and makes a play for him by making herself his perfect match.

He meets French-Canadian gamine Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet) at the jail, when she brings supper to his cell mate. Renee immediately takes a liking to Webster and flirts with him. Webster doesn't have to wait long for trial, and he's escorted to the saloon to meet with the judge. Renee goes along and Webster calls her ""Freckle Face,"" which irritates her. Judge Gannon asks him who he shot. Webster explains it was two men who took it upon themselves to combine his herd with theirs. The judge agrees that was justified, so he dismisses the case, but he also tells Webster his cows are being confiscated for disturbance of the peace, among other things. Webster wants to take issue with that, but he realizes he's badly outnumbered, and justice usually goes to the strongest at the time.The owner of the saloon, a woman named Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman), asks the judge why he confiscated Webster's cattle. ""Because I wanted them,"" he says. Webster and Tatum decide to make for the Klondike, even though they lost their cattle, and begin making preparations. Ronda just happens to be heading up a party bound for Alaska with the cows and she offers Webster a job as her trail boss. Since Webster and Tatum are down to their last $50, and it requires a minimum $100 in food and supplies to receive permission from Judge Gannon to head up the trail, Webster agrees to the job. Plus, he's obviously attracted to Ms. Castle and her to him.Not long into their trip, Webster, Tatum and Ben Rube (Jay C. Flippen), slip off during the night, and take off with the cattle. Gannon and his men pursue. After crossing the border into Canada, Webster uses a few well-placed warning shots to persuade Gannon's gang to give up the chase, but the judge promises a hot reception when Webster returns to Skagway, as he must, for it's the only way to get back.Ronda and her men re-join Webster to complete the journey to Dawson City. She still considers Webster to be her employee, obliged to see them all safely through. As they approach 2-Mile Pass, Webster announces that they will take a trail through the valley and not attempt to go over the pass. Ronda tells him that she won't accept him taking an additional six days to go through the valley, but he won't be persuaded, or ordered, to do differently. So, Ronda and her group head for 2 Mile Pass while Webster and his men, with the cattle, head for the valley.What Webster didn't explain to Ronda was that he was concerned about a possible avalanche in the pass. When Tatum asked Webster why he didn't tell her that, Webster just says, ""she wouldn't listen."" It's not long before there's a loud rumbling noise and Webster and the others look up towards the pass to see a large avalanche taking place. Renee, who's along for the trip, quickly calls for the men to head up there and see if the others needed help. Webster refuses at first, but Renee and Tatum appeal to his sense of morality and he begrudgingly agrees to go with them.Three members of Ronda's group were killed and other injured. The survivors rejoin Webster's group and they all continue on to Dawson City. Ronda tricks Webster into reaching for her coffee cup, and she kisses him. Renee witnesses that and gets very upset.When the group get to Dawson, they find widespread (though relatively peaceful) lawlessness. Webster ignores it as none of his business. There's interest in his cattle and Tatum ends up conducting an impromptu auction, where Ronda outbids the co-owners of the local hash house, Hominy (Connie Gilchrist), Grits (Kathleen Freeman) and Molasses (Connie Van). The people of Dawson City have visions of using their hoped for mining wealth to create a regular town where they can live and raise families. However, Gannon and his gunmen show up in Dawson City and begin cheating the miners out of their claims. One man who takes issue with that is shot to death. The others in town are advised to leave Dawson City and never come back. Dawson has suddenly become a very dangerous place to be.Webster chooses to stay out of the fray, figuring it's better to stay alive and be able to take another direction in life, if need be, or at least wait until the odds are more favorable. He secretly plans to sneak out and make his way back south, while Gannon is otherwise occupied. He and Tatum get down to the river, where Webster has stashed a raft. However, Gannon had been tipped off when Tatum bought some extra coffee for a long trip, and he and his men ride up on them, shooting and killing Ben and wounding Webster.Webster manages to load Tatum's body onto a horse, and then gets on his own horse and rides back to Dawson City. No one makes a move to help until Renee sees them and she goes to Webster's cabin and tends to his wounds. She also makes arrangements for Tatum's burial.Webster is itching to strap on his gun and go after Gannon as soon as he wakes up to find Renee tending to him, but realizes his right hand is wounded too bad. Ronda comes to the cabin to check on Webster. Renee wants Webster to make her leave, but he allows her to stay, so Renee leaves, angry. Ronda wants Webster to leave things be, as far as Gannon is concerned. She believes if Webster tries to do anything, he'll be killed, but Webster isn't about to let Gannon get away with having murdered Tatum.Even though his hand is still not healed, Webster decides to strap on his gun and carry his rifle and go face down Gannon. First, he scares off two of Gannon's men who were in the process of placing a notice on his gold claim, identifying it as now belonging to Gannon.Webster sends his horse down the street, to walk in front of the saloon, where Gannon and his men waited. They were expecting him, so it was very quiet, and they could hear the sound of the small bell attached to the saddle horn (Tatum had been carrying that bell around, intending to put it somewhere in the ranch house they planned to establish in Utah). Two of Gannon's gunmen, Madden (Robert J. Wilke) and Newberry (Jack Elam), were standing in the dark in front of the saloon, ready to shoot down Webster as he rode up. After they are surprised to see that it's a rider-less horse, they start looking around. Webster steps out of the shadows across the street and yells at them. They all start shooting. Webster is hit by a fragment in his cheek, but he shoots and kills Madden and Newberry. Webster then calls Gannon to come out and settle the dispute man-to-man. Gannon confirms that his men know when to come outside, then he slips out the back door and sneaks around the side. Before Gannon can complete his ambush, Ronda rushes out the front door to warn Jeff. Gannon shoots her in the back, killing her. Jeff rushes forward and falls down near Ronda, asking her why she couldn't have just gone away. Gannon and Webster continue their gunfight, shooting at each other from opposite ends of the porch, until Webster shoots and kills Gannon. Gannon's men in the saloon failed to appear in time to help, or save, Gannon. When they did finally step out onto the porch of the saloon, they found themselves facing the rest of the townspeople who were all pointing guns at them. They decide it's time they left town, and they go. Renee rushes up to Webster, ready to help him with his newest wounds.","

    In 1896, Jeff Webster (James Stewart) sees the start of the Klondike gold rush as a golden opportunity to make a fortune in beef.

He tells Dodd that she has to come with them when they go to Boston to fine tune the show. He describes his wife as the drinker and suicidal at times and simply can't be left alone. Dodd takes up his cause, blaming Georgie for Frank's lack of self-confidence and a clash of wills ensues. He soon realizes he may have incorrectly assumed who was supporting who in their relationship.

                    1880s Salford, England. Widowed Henry Hobson, owner/operator of Hobson's Boots, lives with his three adult daughters, Maggie, Alice and Vicky, in a flat attached to the shop. Henry is miserly, dipsomaniacal and tyrannical, not allowing his daughters to date as their sole purpose in life is in service to him and to the shop, they who receive no wages in that professional service. He changes his mind about Alice and Vicky, for who he will choose husbands, despite they, the romantic ones, already having chosen the men they would marry if given the opportunity. He will, however, not provide them with a dowry, which may prove to be a challenge in finding them who he would consider suitable husbands. Concerning Maggie, he believes she is far too useful to him as the overly efficient and organized one to let go, and too old at age thirty for any man to want her anyway. Incensed by her father's attitude about her, Maggie decides that she has to show him how wrong he is about her being an unmarriable spinster. As such, she makes a proposal to timid Willy Mossop, the shop's poor, uneducated and illiterate boot hand but best boot maker - apparently better than any boot maker in nearby Manchester - he who has known no other professional life than the shop: they enter into a marriage of convenience. Despite the differences in their social classes, Maggie believes she can show her father that she can find a husband, while forcing him to treat Willy better, and by association her, by paying him decent wages or else she will use her wifely influence to convince Willy to take his and her valuable services elsewhere. If their hands are forced, Maggie believes their best weapon is wealthy and particular Mrs. Hepworth, who said she will have no one else but Willy make her boots. Maggie has even taken into consideration what effect her actions will have on her sisters' nuptials, she who vows to them that all will be all right in that regard. Although she truly has no idea how her father will react, she also may not have considered Willy, who may already have a life of his own outside the shop, and if he does agree what effect her plan will have on him and his entire being.

The film shows how the strong females come to the fore in shaping their own world at a time when it was frowned on. Behind the boots and clogs are individuals who must also be determined and strong in a society that gives them little credence. Keeping the humour it also shows without fantasy the life of the Salford folk and the social connections and customs that gave their life order, untill they were challenged and eventually changed.

He is sentenced to a gladiator school, where he draws the lustful attention of sensuous Messalina (Susan Hayward), the unsatisfied wife of Caligula's elderly uncle. Demetrius initially refuses to fight out of devotion to his Christian beliefs. But when he spurns the advances of Messalina, she is enraged and wants revenge. He is returned to the arena where he is forced to defend himself against several tigers, killing all of them. He becomes a hero to the crowds. Lucia goes to the gladiator school to see Demetrius, but Messalina allows her to fall into the hands of the gladiators. As one of the gladiators hungrily paws at her, a helpless Demetrius prays for her deliverance. She fights wildly before falling into a catatonic state resembling death. An embittered Demetrius renounces his faith and accepts a post as a centurion. Caligula sends Demetrius to the Christian enclave to personally find the robe, where he finds unconscious Lucia clutching the sacred robe. The emotional encounter sets him on the path to redemption.

He has passed on his love of music to his three early adult daughters - Amy, Fran and Laurie - who live with him and his spinster sister, the girls' Aunt Jessie. Gregory and his daughters often rehearse together as a musical quartet. The girls support each other however they can, but each is an individual with her own distinct personality and wants, including the type of man each wants as a husband. After only seven dates, Fran becomes engaged to developer Bob Neary, a man with prospects and wealth aspirations, which match Fran's own aspirations. After Fran and Bob's announcement, Laurie and Amy vow to be spinster sisters together, despite practical but deep in her heart romantic Amy long having been courted by unassuming plumber, Ernest Nichols, who dotes on her. Only fun loving Laurie truly believes she will not get married. Their collective lives change with the entry into their lives of two men. The first is Gregory's old friend's son, composer Alex Burke, who is in the process of writing the songs and incidental music for a Broadway musical. He easily gets a job at the foundation using his natural and sincere charm which he applies to all equally, those charms which he also uses to get temporary lodging at the Tuttle home while he spends most of his time writing. Many women misconstrue that charm for romantic interest. The second is Alex's orchestrator and arranger, Barney Sloan. Barney has a chip on his shoulders about what life has dealt him, which he uses in turn as a reason for living a reckless life. The two men make each of the three daughters reexamine what she thinks she wants in life, or more precisely who she wants, which for all may be the same person, and affects what all three end up doing in their romantic life.

                    In the old West, a small frontier town is being controlled by ruthless mob boss Decker and his cronies. After the local sheriff dies under mysterious circumstances, Decker arranges to have the town drunk appointed sheriff, thinking he will be ineffectual. But the new sheriff sends for Tom Destry, son of a famous two-fisted lawman, to be his deputy. When Tom arrives, he isn't exactly the swaggering he-man the sheriff had in mind. In fact, Destry doesn't even carry a gun. But the new deputy's mild exterior masks a fierce determination to see justice done, as Decker and the other locals soon discover.

                    Young Prince Valiant, son of the exiled King of Scandia, journeys to Camelot to become a knight at King Arthur's Round Table. He hopes to help his father reclaim his throne from the pagan Viking usurper Sligon and restore the Christian faith to their homeland. On his journey he stumbles upon a mysterious Black Knight plotting with Sligon's representatives to overthrow Arthur. Barely escaping with his life, Valiant encounters Sir Gawain, one of the most illustrious knights of the Round Table, and an old friend of his father's, who tutors the young Viking in the skills needed to be a knight. Valiant and Gawain's pupil-mentor relationship is complicated by their romantic involvement with Princess Aleta and her sister Ilene, daughters of the King of Ord. If Valiant is to restore his father's throne and prevent the coup d'etat against Arthur, he must uncover the true identity of the Black Knight.

                    On 30 September 1659, the aristocratic British Robinson Crusoe's ship sinks and he miraculously survives on a deserted island somewhere in South America. He retrieves a dog, Rex, and cat, Sam, from the shipwreck together with some supplies, weapons, clothes and tools and builds a shelter. He soon learns how to survive by cooking, farming, harvesting the crops. Then the loneliness begins to haunt him, especially after the loss of Rex. When he sees a group of cannibals in the island, tension and fear become part of his life. Later he saves the life of a savage that was going to be eaten by the cannibals; he names him Friday and they become friends. When Robinson Crusoe sees Caucasians on the island, he finds that Captain Oberzo was the victim of a mutiny and he helps him to retrieve his ship.

Hitting a storm along the way, he gets shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island somewhere in the Atlantic. The only known survivors are himself and the ship's two mascots, a cat named Sam and a dog named Rex. Crusoe manages to bring on shore some supplies from the wrecked ship before it sinks for good. Despite being from the privileged class, Crusoe is determined to eke out a life for himself on the island while he waits for a passing ship to rescue him, that is if he doesn't die from the sheer torture of isolation first. As he waits and waits and waits, he learns that not all passersby may be friendly, but that some can be rehabilitated to the proper English way.

Though they still haven't taken sides, Trane and Erin agree to escort the aristocratic Countess Marie Duvarre through hostile territory to Vera Cruz. It soon develops that the Countess is transporting a gold shipment to the Emperor's armies. Hardly the most patriotic of souls, she offers to split the gold with Trane and Erin, but they steal it for themselves instead.

Since the Emperor got the most cash, our hired guns agree to serve the Emperor by escorting a certain Countess to the city of Vera Cruz by passing through territory under rebel control. On the way to Vera Cruz, both fighters discover 3 million dollars in gold coins (intended to buy guns for the Emperor from France) hidden at the bottom of the stagecoach carrying the Countess and she is not totally unaware of the fact either. She has her own plans too. All three plot against the other two to scoop the treasure away. Betrayal is not an issue. It's not even personal. It's just business. After a few gunfight and ambush scenes between the Maxmillian's escorting army and the peasant rebels, justice reigns and Ben Trane emerges as the noble soul who triumphs over crass materialism despite the ""soft spot"" in his heart that Joe Erin took it for weakness.

The story, told in flashback, begins with an abandoned infant found in a reed basket on the Nile who is taken into the home of a talented physician, Senmut (Carl Benton Reid). Named Sinuhe, he grows into an idealistic young man. First he wants to become a soldier, but then his father talks him out of it, and Sinuhe undertakes studies to become a physician, just like his foster father.Sinuhe (Edmund Purdom) becomes best friends with the energetic and extroverted Horemheb (Victor Mature), who is training for the army at the same school run by the priests. Very different in character, the two friends go on an excursion hunting lions in the desert. They save the life of a strange lone man who they find worshiping a carved image of the sun. Unbeknownst to them, he is actually the new young Pharaoh Akhnaton (Michael Wilding), who is introducing a far less war-like type of rule into Egypt based on the worship of one god, the Aten.Akhnaton makes Sinuhe personal physician to the royal family and Horemheb a commander in his army. Enjoying the good life, Horemheb one night takes Sinuhe to the home of an infamous Babylonian courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi), with whom Sinuhe becomes instantly infatuated. Nefer, however, only plays with men, and before too long, Sinuhe has sacrificed everything for her, only to be then cruelly rejected when she is tired of playing with him. Kaptah (Peter Ustinov) used to be a slave of Sinuhe's foster family, but he insisted in remaining with him, instead of going with Nefer. Kaptah and Sinuhe will remain in contact throughout the years, although they have a strange relationship based on equality; Kaptah will become a free man, a bar patron, and later, quite a rich merchant, with the help of Sinuhe, his initial investment, and his connections.Having neglected his duties, Sinuhe is a marked man and flees Egypt, spending many years in foreign countries practicing his medical genius. When he returns home, however, Egypt has slipped into serious trouble, as Akhnaton has lost the respect of the military, and his new religion is dividing the country. The fact that Queen Nefertiti (Anitra Stevens) has only been able to give birth to daughters is not helping either, but there may be other wives or a concubine who will finally succeed in having the heir the country needs so badly.Sinuhe finds Horemheb is plotting against the Pharaoh with the ambitious Princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney). In the rebellion that follows, Merit (Jean Simmons), who had always been a good friend of Sinuhe--and who may even be falling in love with him (and him with her)--is killed when Akhnaton's temple is sacked, and Sinuhe loses his young son Thoth (Tommy Rettig). When it is revealed he is actually the Pharoah's half brother, Sinuhe finally realizes how he has compromised all of his principles, and leaves to start a lonely existence on his own in the desert, bereft of family or love.","
    
                    In eighteenth-dynasty Egypt, Sinuhe, a poor orphan, becomes a brilliant physician and with his friend Horemheb is appointed to the service of the new Pharoah. Sinuhe's personal triumphs and tragedies are played against the larger canvas of the turbulent events of the 18th dynasty. As Sinuhe is drawn into court intrigues, and bizarre secrets are revealed to him, he learns the answers to the questions he has sought since his birth. Short on historical accuracy but strong on plot and characterization.

Kaptah and Sinuhe will remain in contact throughout the years, although they have a strange relationship based on equality; Kaptah will become a free man, a bar patron, and later, quite a rich merchant, with the help of Sinuhe, his initial investment, and his connections.Having neglected his duties, Sinuhe is a marked man and flees Egypt, spending many years in foreign countries practicing his medical genius. When he returns home, however, Egypt has slipped into serious trouble, as Akhnaton has lost the respect of the military, and his new religion is dividing the country. The fact that Queen Nefertiti (Anitra Stevens) has only been able to give birth to daughters is not helping either, but there may be other wives or a concubine who will finally succeed in having the heir the country needs so badly.Sinuhe finds Horemheb is plotting against the Pharaoh with the ambitious Princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney). In the rebellion that follows, Merit (Jean Simmons), who had always been a good friend of Sinuhe--and who may even be falling in love with him (and him with her)--is killed when Akhnaton's temple is sacked, and Sinuhe loses his young son Thoth (Tommy Rettig). When it is revealed he is actually the Pharoah's half brother, Sinuhe finally realizes how he has compromised all of his principles, and leaves to start a lonely existence on his own in the desert, bereft of family or love.

He is wired up for an experiment in freezing and thawing. Through the window we see Dr. Hubertus (Michael Fox), the department head. The chamber is reduced in temperature to minus 85 degrees and Pepe is frozen solid in less than two minutes. The process is reversed and Pepe is revived. The test is deemed a success. Pepe is sent to the lab for a blood count, and Dr. Hubertus sends Dr. Kirby to the supply room for a more sensitive thermostat. After Dr. Kirby leaves, the cold chamber door closes, trapping Hubertus. He struggles to get out as the automated equipment begins its deep cold cycle. Hubertus is frozen solid. Dr. Kirby finds the thermostat and returns to the cryo lab. She enters the chamber to discover the dead and shattered remains of Dr. Hubertus. The door closes on her and the cryo cycle repeats, killing her.A helicopter crosses the desert sky. On board is the pilot Al (an uncredited Al Bayer) and his passenger, Dr. David Sheppard (Richard Egan). They are headed for the satellite project, a top secret facility built underground. The helicopter is suddenly tossed around, much to Sheppards concern, but the pilot explains that the ""brain"" has taken over the controls and will do the flying. It keeps the exact location of the facility secret. The pair are being monitored by central control. Just before they land the sun mirror shines on them.After landing, Dr. Sheppard is met by two security guards, Andy (an uncredited Andy Andrews) and Julie (an uncredited Julian Ludwig). They ask for and verify Dr. Sheppards credentials. Cleared for entry, Julie escorts Sheppard in the elevator to Dr. Van Ness' office. Dr. Van Ness (Herbert Marshall) greets Sheppard and unlocks the brief case he has manacled to his wrist. Sheppard presents his orders and is told he was specifically requested because the project is in jeopardy, and Van Ness has ""positive proof of a saboteur on my staff."" He calls his assistant, Joanna Merritt (Constance Dowling), to bring in the devices--miniature RADAR beacons. Sheppard recognizes them and comments on their fine craftsmanship. Van Ness gives Sheppard a briefing on the underground facility, but admits an H-bomb would wipe out the project. Sheppard suggests he become familiar with the project and staff. Van Ness agrees and assigns Miss Merritt as his guide. Van Ness contacts his security officer, Major Howard, and issues new security orders. Major Howard informs him that another code transmitter device has been found.In the locker room, Sheppard changes into a brown jumpsuit with a gold arm band. Joanna informs him that gold gives him access to all the laboratories. She also provides him with a radiation badge. While their first meeting, in front of Van Ness, is formal and business-like, when they are alone it is revealed they've known each other for some time and had been more intimate. She has been assigned to the project by the security services that employ Sheppard. So secret is her mission, even her boss, Van Ness is unaware of her affiliation. She provides Sheppard a list of suspects: Dr. and Mrs. Elzevir, Dr. Zeitman, and Dr. Engel. Sheppard burns the list. They exit the locker room and head for the Chemistry lab on the second level.Marna Roberts (Jeanne Dean), surrounded by lab equipment and glassware, is performing an experiment in the dark. When Joanna and Sheppard arrive, she turns on the lights and greets the duo. Sheppard wants a sample analyzed--some dust he found in one of the code transmitters. Marna hands him a slide. She tells him to come back in 30 minutes, and Joanna and Sheppard exit, their next destination is the Helio-Engineering lab.Van Ness is already meeting with Dr. Pierre Elzevir (Phillip Van Zandt) and his wife Mrs. Elzevir (Valerie Vernon). Sheppard and Joanna arrive. Van Ness, excited and proud, shows Sheppard a scale model of the space station at the heart of the project. The Elzevir's are working on the solar mirror which will provide the station all its power. They also demonstrate the destructive power it has at its disposal. Sheppard is also told that the mirror is controlled by NOVAC by code transmitters.Van Ness, Sheppard and Joanna walk next door to visit Dr. Carter (Byron Kane) in the Human Factors lab. Elzevir tags along. Carter explains his weightlessness chamber and we are introduced to his male, Vince (an uncredited Alex Jackson) and female test subjects. Van Ness gets a phone call from Major Howard, and he, Sheppard, and Joanna race to security. Mrs. Elzevir comes to collect her husband, who shows way too much interest in the female subject in the chamber.Major Howard (Stephen Roberts) and his assistant are busy tracking an unknown object. The three arrive and are told an unknown and unauthorized jet plane is in the area flying faster than the speed of sound. Van Ness informs Sheppard that another code transmitter was discovered in Dr. Zeitman's room.Joanna and Sheppard, on the third level, stand outside Zeitman's lab. They must wait until an experiment is completed before they can enter. Zeitman (John Wengraf) pulls a component from NOVAC (Nuclear Operative Variable Automatic Computer) and makes a few notes and adjustments to the electronic brain. Dr. Engle (William Shallert) assists. Joanna explains that NOVAC was built in Switzerland and took five years to complete, and Zeitman was the designer. Joanna introduces Sheppard to the two robots--Gog and Magog. Zeitman and Engle demonstrate how they operate. Via punched tape, Gog is directed to make an adjustment on a machine, and Magog is directed to hand Dr. Sheppard a screwdriver. The atomic pile on the fourth level is next on the tour, but before they leave, Zeitman, a brilliant but arrogant man, gets a lecture on security regulations.Sheppard and Joanna examine some of the automated nuclear processes before she introduces Sheppard to Dr. Peter Burden (David Alpert), the chief atomic engineer. He shows Sheppard the monitoring panel, which suddenly shows a strong detection of alpha particles on the second level. They rush off with a Geiger counter and discover the source to be the Chemistry Lab, where Sheppard left a sample to be analyzed. Burden enters in his protective suit, followed by Sheppard and Joanna. They discover Marna collapsed on the floor. Burden pronounces her dead, a victim of excess radiation. He takes the body away, while Joanna calls security and orders a decontamination team be sent to the Chemistry Lab. Sheppard discovers the source of the radiation, an isotope, buried in a potted plant. Burden recovers it and shields it inside a lead vault. Sheppard believes someone is on to his mission, the sample he gave Marna is missing, the equipment destroyed and Marna is dead.Because Vince, the human factors subject, and Marna were involved romantically, Sheppard goes to the Human Facotor Lab to talk to him. Dr. Carter had already started a centrifuge experiment to test new pressure suits with Vince and the female subject. When a call is made to stop all experiments and department heads to report to Dr. Van Ness, Carter aborts his experiment, but the equipment malfunctions, killing both test subjects.In Van Ness office, the department heads are briefed and told that sabotage and murder has endangered all the scientists and the project. He orders security tightened even further. Meanwhile, Mrs. Elzevir, back in the Helio-Lab, is the next target. She manages to disable the equipment before she is the next victim. At the same time, Major Howard's assistant triggers the alarm of an unauthorized jet plane in the area. Howard orders everyone out of the room and tries to disconnect the sound detector, but he is overcome by the high decibel sound. Sheppard, Joanna and Howard's assistant must break into the room. After order is restored, Joanna and Sheppard go down to see Zeitman.Zeitman questions Engle about the missing robot, Magog. Engle explains that it is not possible as he had the power off on NOVAC, and that he never experiments with the robots without Zeitman's express permission. When Sheppard and Joanna arrive, he tells Zeitman that he has concluded that the person controlling NOVAC has to be the killer and saboteur. But with the power off, then who controls the equipment and robots? Before they can answer that question, Gog is activated and attacks and kills Engle and Zeitman. Before he dies, Zeitman instructs Sheppard to use a flame thrower to disable the robot. Magog has gone down to the atomic pile to pull out the safety rod--an action that will result in an explosion and destruction of the underground facility. Sheppard calls Van Ness and tells him the jet flying over the project is responsible for the sabotage and murders and must be destroyed. Jets are scrambled from a nearby Air Force Base. Sheppard and Joanna arrive in the atomic pile room. He pushes the safety rod back and disables Magog with the flame thrower. No sooner has he disabled Magog, but Gog arrives with the intent of completing Magog's directive to destroy the facility. Van Ness arrives armed with a flame thrower, but his malfunctions. The Air Force destroys the rocket plane flying over the project, and Gog shuts itself off. Joanna collapses and Van Ness notices her and Sheppard's badge indicates an exposure to excess radiation.Some days or weeks later Van Ness, in his office, meets with a Senator (Tom Daly). He briefs the Senator on what happened at the facility. He also informs him that a practical model has been completed and will be launched the next morning.

Troubling her, however, is the fact that John's father Tom deliberately built the mansion across the path long taken by elephants on their way to the river and constructed a wall to keep them at bay. John's violent hatred of one particular bull elephant surprises Ruth, and she is also startled to learn that Tom is buried in a lavish marble grave behind the house, while John's mother is buried in England, because, according to Appuhamy, she hated Ceylon.Soon after his return, John's friends, fellow English planters and his American overseer, Dick Carver, drop by the house to meet Ruth. The men welcome Ruth, the only white woman in the area, then proceed to get drunk while toasting the greatness of John's father. Dick, who is leaving for Paris the next day, assures Ruth that Tom was more vain than heroic and counsels her not to take his legacy too seriously.Later, Ruth is awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of John and his friends playing polo on bicycles across the mansion's spacious floors. When Ruth tells John she was frightened by the noise, he coldly dismisses her fears as childish. Ruth runs crying back to her bedroom, and suddenly shamed, John follows and apologizes.The next day, Ruth notices Appuhamy praying at the foot of Tom's grave and tours the enormous kitchen with him. Appuhamy shows Ruth the items that were special favorites of ""the old master,"" which are still being purchased, and balks when she offers to plan the menu so as to reduce the amount of waste generated by the plantation. Appuhamy also refuses to give Ruth the key to Tom's old study, piquing Ruth's curiosity.That night, Dick stops by to say farewell and, before going, encourages Ruth to contact him if she needs help. Later, John fractures his leg while drunkenly playing bicycle polo and is confined to his bed. During his convalescence, Ruth tries to sneak into Tom's study but hides when Appuhamy appears. After overhearing Appuhamy declare to a portrait of Tom that Ruth ""does not belong"" at Elephant Walk, Ruth learns from John's doctor that John's belligerent attitudes are impeding his recovery. Ruth writes to Dick for help, and he quickly returns and resumes his work as overseer.John's mood does not improve, however, as the expected monsoons have not started and the elephants have become agitated over the lack of water. When John yells at her for changing his lunch menu without permission, Ruth rushes to Dick, and while out riding with him, confesses that John is still ruled by his dead father. Dick kisses Ruth, who, despite her attraction, pulls away, protesting that she still loves John. Back at the plantation, John apologizes to Ruth and tries to appease her by announcing a special upcoming celebration.The celebration turns out to be an elaborate birthday party for Tom, and Ruth finally explodes with frustration, ordering John's drunken friends out of the house. The next morning, John condemns Ruth for driving his friends away and, when she insists that he hates Tom as much as she does, slaps her. Stunned, Ruth runs to Dick's quarters and begs him to take her to Paris. At the same time, however, one of John's servants collapses with cholera and the plantation is placed under quarantine.Trapped at Elephant Walk, Ruth and Dick toil long hours to help John curb the epidemic and soothe the terrified workers. When John, who is aware of Ruth's plans to leave him, insists on burying the dead himself, Ruth is impressed by his selfless dedication. Later, after the quarantine is lifted, Ruth tells Dick that she cannot leave John before the rains come, despite Dick's protests that John has not changed.As a final precaution, the workers' huts are set ablaze, and the elephants, agitated by the fire, start to stampede. With no workers available to beat them back, the elephants crash through the plantation wall and storm the house. Appuhamy, who has finally recognized Ruth's true worth, rushes to alert her and is killed by an angry elephant. While crashing through the house, the elephants cause a fire to erupt, and John barely arrives in time to rescue Ruth. Just then, the rain starts, and as Elephant Walk burns to the ground, John and Ruth embrace and pledge to start a new life together.","
    
                    Colonial tea planter John Wiley, visiting England at the end of World War II, wins and weds lovely English rose Ruth and takes her home to Elephant Walk, Ceylon, where the local elephants have a grudge against the plantation. Ruth's delight with the tropical wealth and luxury of her new home is tempered by isolation as the only white woman in the district; by her husband's occasional imperious arrogance; by a mutual physical attraction with plantation manager Dick Carver; and by the hovering, ominous menace of the hostile elephants...

She arrives to find a huge house full of servants and learns that she's the only European woman in the area with the other tea planters being bachelors. Most annoying however is the veneration of her husband's late father who is still adored by Europeans and locals alike. He is the man who built Elephant Walk, their plantation house, so named by the fact that it was built in the direct path used by elephants to get to water. Dick Carver is one of the few who has never bought to the myth of the great founder and Ruth and he hit it off from the start. With her husband frequently away working, Ruth and Dick develop feelings for one another. A drought and the ensuing cholera epidemic will decide everyone's future.

Appuhamy also refuses to give Ruth the key to Tom's old study, piquing Ruth's curiosity.That night, Dick stops by to say farewell and, before going, encourages Ruth to contact him if she needs help. Later, John fractures his leg while drunkenly playing bicycle polo and is confined to his bed. During his convalescence, Ruth tries to sneak into Tom's study but hides when Appuhamy appears. After overhearing Appuhamy declare to a portrait of Tom that Ruth ""does not belong"" at Elephant Walk, Ruth learns from John's doctor that John's belligerent attitudes are impeding his recovery. Ruth writes to Dick for help, and he quickly returns and resumes his work as overseer.John's mood does not improve, however, as the expected monsoons have not started and the elephants have become agitated over the lack of water. When John yells at her for changing his lunch menu without permission, Ruth rushes to Dick, and while out riding with him, confesses that John is still ruled by his dead father. Dick kisses Ruth, who, despite her attraction, pulls away, protesting that she still loves John. Back at the plantation, John apologizes to Ruth and tries to appease her by announcing a special upcoming celebration.The celebration turns out to be an elaborate birthday party for Tom, and Ruth finally explodes with frustration, ordering John's drunken friends out of the house. The next morning, John condemns Ruth for driving his friends away and, when she insists that he hates Tom as much as she does, slaps her. Stunned, Ruth runs to Dick's quarters and begs him to take her to Paris. At the same time, however, one of John's servants collapses with cholera and the plantation is placed under quarantine.Trapped at Elephant Walk, Ruth and Dick toil long hours to help John curb the epidemic and soothe the terrified workers. When John, who is aware of Ruth's plans to leave him, insists on burying the dead himself, Ruth is impressed by his selfless dedication. Later, after the quarantine is lifted, Ruth tells Dick that she cannot leave John before the rains come, despite Dick's protests that John has not changed.As a final precaution, the workers' huts are set ablaze, and the elephants, agitated by the fire, start to stampede. With no workers available to beat them back, the elephants crash through the plantation wall and storm the house. Appuhamy, who has finally recognized Ruth's true worth, rushes to alert her and is killed by an angry elephant. While crashing through the house, the elephants cause a fire to erupt, and John barely arrives in time to rescue Ruth. Just then, the rain starts, and as Elephant Walk burns to the ground, John and Ruth embrace and pledge to start a new life together.

                    Based on an actual strike against the Empire Zinc Mine in New Mexico, the film deals with the prejudice against the Mexican-American workers, who struck to attain wage parity with Anglo workers in other mines and to be treated with dignity by the bosses. In the end, the greatest victory for the workers and their families is the realization that prejudice and poor treatment are conditions that are not always imposed by outside forces.

They are at the stage of hating the other so much that despite the divorce being uncontested on both sides, each is irked that the break-up isn't causing the other any grief. Each also feels that the downfall of their marriage is in large part due to the advice and support of their primary confidantes, Robert's being his womanizing best friend, plagiarizing playwright and old army buddy Charlie Nelson, and Nina's being her mother, interior designer Edith Chapman who is further advised by who Robert considers Edith's quack of a therapist, Dr. Van Kessel. During the post-divorce period, Robert and Nina can't seem to help but constantly run into each other. Their individual lives also seem somewhat to parallel each other, including the satisfaction of their respective dates with others, which are encouraged by Charlie and Edith. That parallel also includes an eventual realization about their true feeling for the other. The question becomes if their pre-divorce behavior of not stating what they're feeling will kibosh what each really wants in life.

                    Gladys Glover has just lost her modelling job when she meets filmmaker Pete Sheppard shooting a documentary in Central Park. For Pete it's love at first sight, but Gladys has her mind on other things -- like making a name for herself. Through a fluke of advertising she winds up with her name plastered over 10 billboards throughout city. Suddenly all of New York is clamoring for Gladys Glover without knowing why and playboy Evan Adams III is making a play for Gladys that even Pete knows will be hard to beat.

                    Gladys Glover, a naive and starry eyed young woman, came to New York City less than two years ago from upstate to make a name for herself. Not only has that not happened, but she just got fired from her latest job as a girdle model. Documentary filmmaker Pete Sheppard, who she meets by chance and who falls in love with her at first sight, predicts that if an opportunity presents itself, she will be able to seize it. Based on that idea, Gladys, seeing that it is available and using her life savings, decides to rent out a giant billboard in busy Columbus Circle for three months, the signage to be only her name in large lettering. While Gladys loves the billboard and takes any opportunity to stare at it, Pete believes it is a wacky idea since it means nothing, and if it does attract attention, it will only be of the kind that will brand Gladys as a nut. It does attract some attention, most specifically of wealthy playboy Evan Adams III of Adams Soap, the company which wants to use the billboard for their regular summer advertising campaign. Despite Gladys and Evan's antagonistic first meeting, Evan sees in Gladys his next romantic conquest. In Gladys and Evan's negotiations for that billboard space, Evan may be able to parlay Gladys' want for notoriety into his own amorous gains. Gladys has to weigh if this wanted fame is worth it any any cost, even at the expense of losing Pete, for who she also seems to be falling.

When the prince pays his compliments, Brummell responds with suggestions for improving the design of the regiment's uniforms, and George, who designed the uniforms himself, is offended. Brummell, a man of exacting sartorial and Epicurean tastes, is unfazed by the prince's disapproval, and makes an appearance that evening, wearing daring stove pipe pants, at a regimental dinner. There he meets the beautiful Lady Patricia Belham, the intended of George's political advisor, Lord Edwin Mercer. When Brummell refuses to retract his criticism of the uniforms, the prince discharges him from the service.Late that night, as Brummell watches his regiment embark on an overseas assignment, Patricia approaches him and asks why he is willing to sacrifice his military career. The proud Brummell explains that he is unwilling to compromise his dignity and self-respect, and impulsively kisses her. Brummell is left with no clear course for the future, however, as he has neither family name nor fortune. While strolling through town one day with his loyal valet Mortimer, Brummell sees politician Sir Ralph Sidley addressing a crowd. Brummell interrupts Sidley's speech with some sharply worded comments about the prince, and a newspaper reporter invites him to repeat his opinions the following evening at a civic meeting. Brummell accepts, and quickly makes a name for himself with his stinging indictment of the prince's excesses.Later, George is urged by Mercer and his prime minister, William Pitt, to end his relationship with his widowed, Catholic lover, Mrs. Maria Anne Fitzherbert, and make an advantageous marriage. Brummell is summoned by the prince, and as he urges George to stand up to Pitt, a bond begins to grow between the two men. One evening, when Brummell returns from the prince's birthday party, Mortimer warns him that his numerous creditors are growing impatient and suggests they go abroad. Brummell, who has become George's close friend and confidant, refuses, insisting that the prince needs him.

Brummell tells the prince that Pitt has been concealing the fact that King George III has gone mad. He urges the prince to have his father certified insane and declare himself regent, which would empower him to marry whomever he pleases.With Brummell and several doctors at his side, the prince goes to court and calls on George III, who is declared mad after he fails to recognize his son and tries to strangle him.

Banks tells Mrs. Martin that wreckage was discovered, and the body of the pilot, but not of her husband. Dr. Kurt Kruger (Frank Gerstle) enters the office and comforts the widow. Sometime later, Dr. Martin wanders back to the base guard gate, still wearing his flight suit. He is brought to the base hospital and examined by Dr./Maj. Clift (Shepard Menken). Clift pronounces Martin fit and asks him to recount his movements after the crash. Martin, now sporting an ""L"" shaped scar on his chest that measures about four inches by four inches, remembers nothing between the crash and his arrival at the base gate. The doctor asks about the scar, and Martin explains he must have gotten it in the crash. Dr. Clift refutes that story by explaining, ""No this was surgery. Very skillful incision.""Mr. Briggs (Steve Pendleton) is from the FBI. He joins Col. Banks and Maj. Clift to discuss Dr. Martin. Banks just finished questioning Dr. Martin. Briggs is concerned about security and wants all the missing time to be accounted, and adds, ""Did you ever stop to think that perhaps this Dr. Martin isn't really THE Dr. Martin?"" Sometime later Briggs was able to confirm that Dr. Martin was the same and informed Col. Banks. Banks and Cliff called Ellen in to brief her on her husband, and why he was still being held in the base hospital.

Doug gets up and phones the duty desk at the base. He speaks to Sgt. Bandero (Burt Wenland). He asks about the next planned test and is upset when he is told, ""Sorry sir, regulations.

He goes out to get the newspaper and is shocked to read the headline, ""Another Atom Bomb Exploded: 6 a.m. Blast Visible for 300 Miles."" Doug confronts Col. Banks and Dr. Kruger. He demands to know why he wasn't briefed and is told he is still sick and a security risk. He is given a choice; Go home or be confined to the base hospital. He storms out of the room and enters his office where he is greeted by his secretary, Miss Vincent (Ruth Bennett). He gives her the rest of the day off and waits until after 6:00 p.m. He fills his pipe, but when the phone rings he ignores it. Dr. Kruger locks up his office vault and departs. He checks Dr. Martin's office, and finds it empty. Doug heard his colleague and hid behind the door. Doug steals into Kruger's office, unlocks the vault and enters. He reviews some files, then exits Kruger's office, leaving the vault door wide open. A guard (Robert Roark) on rounds discovers the security breach and contacts the main gate. Sgt. Powers (Ron Gans as Ron Kennedy) confirms Dr. Kruger checked out and had left the base about twenty minutes before the call. Dr. Martin signs out at the gate as the guard is taking the call.Briggs meets Dr. Kruger at his home. He asks that Kruger return to the base. They drive separately. Now in his office, Kruger confirms for Briggs that the papers in his vault are in order. Briggs asks about why he left the vault open, but is assured by Kruger that it was secured for the evening. Briggs asks who has the combination. The answer is only three - Kruger, Banks, and Dr. Martin. Briggs notes that Dr. Martin signed out twenty minutes after Kruger left.

He wakes in a hospital bed mumbling, ""There here. There here. They're going to destroy us."" Hovering over his bed are Dr. Clift, Briggs, Kruger, and Col. Banks. The doctor gives him an injection of truth serum. Under its influence, his interrogation is recorded. The first question they ask involves the examination of the contents of Kruger's vault. Doug explains he was gathering and delivering information to a drop location at Soledad Flats.

When he got up from the table the ""L"" shaped scar was fresh and he was escorted through a cave system to confront Denab (John Frederick as John Merrick). Denab explains that he is a scientist from a planet unknown to humans. Doug tries to run, but Denab activates a ray that immobilizes Doug. Denab goes on to explain that they are accumulating the energy released by atomic explosions, then hands Doug the information gathered on the most recent test. Denab reminds Doug that he did not survive the crash and that they revived him because, ""We had an important need of your services."" Denab explains that their sun is beginning to fail and they moved to planets closer to the dying star. Their next move will have to be to Earth, all one billion aliens. The invasion is already being staged. Doug manages to escape into the cave system, but doesn't really know how to get out. During his wandering he encounters giant spiders, lizards, and insects. He learns that they are being bred to devour all life on earth to make way for the alien invasion. Doug guesses the aliens are tapping power from a local power station to keep the energy they've already captured safe. He surmises that an overload would destroy the facility. The Tala (also John Frederick as John Merrick) hypnotizes Doug to remember nothing and to obtain information on the upcoming tests. Doug finishes his story. Of course, no one believes him.

At the hospital, Ellen comes to see her husband. Doug gets up and tries to leave, but is put back to bed. Doug asks for a pencil, paper and a slide rule. Kruger is called and soon arrives in Doug's room. Doug feverously works on formulae and calculations. Doug calculates that he only needs eight to ten seconds of power cut to accomplish his goal of stopping the aliens. Doug escapes the base hospital and drives off to the power generating station.

"100","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047559/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Titles and credits are shown over a view of the Earth from space, zooming in until we see the city below. We open in a room, the time is 1:30 p.m. and a woman lies asleep on a bed. Her name is Nora King (Kathleen Crowley) and despite what she thought was going to be a fatal overdose of sleeping pills, she wakes to an empty city. She soon discovers there is no water or electricity in her boarding house, and no people either. She exits the building and is confused as she wanders the deserted streets. She runs from street to street and finally finds a woman. She is dead and Nora recoils in horror. She backs away from the body and straight into a man smoking a cigarette with his jacket slung over his shoulder. Frank Brooks (Richard Denning) looks at Nora as she flees. He yells, ""Hey, wait a minute."" He chases her down an alley. He has her trapped so she picks up a brick and warns Frank, ""Don't come any closer."" He disarms, then slaps her. He explains that he won't hurt her and that he had nothing to do with the dead woman. They try to guess what has happened. They deduce that an evacuation was called, but are at a loss as to why.They walk through the empty streets. Frank breaks into an appliance store. He wants a portable radio to hear any news reports. They find one, but there are no batteries. They exit the store and hear a piano playing. They follow the sound and enter a bar/restaurant. Inside they find a woman in a cocktail dress at the piano drinking champagne. Vicki Harris (Virginia Grey) lights a cigarette and playfully calls to her long-time boyfriend, Jim Wilson (Richard Reeves) for more champagne. Slightly drunk he pops up from behind the bar with two bottles of Bollinger. Nora and Frank join the celebrating couple and ask, ""What are you two doing here?"" Vicki goes to the kitchen and prepares a turkey dinner. The four eat and drink. Nora suggests another club to visit five miles away.Out on the street, they find a car with the hood slightly ajar. When the men open the door for the ladies, a body of a dead man slumps towards the opening door. Frank and Jim remove the body while the ladies try to collect themselves. The men try to start the car with no success. Jim discovers the distributor cap loose and the rotor missing. Vicki and Nora return to the car. When Vicki asks what a missing rotor means, a man, Charles Otis (Mort Marshall) informs her, ""It means you can't get the engine started."" He explains to the four that he's been trying to get out of town, but all the cars he's found have the same problem. Otis explains he came from the north and the whole town is a wreck, windows are smashed, and houses and stores are wrecked. Everyone he has seen was dead. On the wall they see the shadow of some unidentifiable thing. They run to the safety of a nearby hotel.Safely inside they discover a newspaper. The headline reads, ""INVASION by Mystery Army."" An army invaded the day before and the city was ordered evacuated. Otis panics and runs for the door. Outside he spots a member of that army, a mechanical creature with a triangular body, flexible tube legs, metal boots, pincers on a pair of solid tube arms, and a trapezoidal head. The thing spots Otis and dispatches the man with a solid white beam of light. The beam emanates from an oval screen on its head. The two couples decide to stay in the hotel and secure a key to a suite on the fourth floor. They take the stairs to the room and lock themselves in.At Army headquarters near the city a meeting is taking place. Lt. General Wood (Arthur Space) briefs the assembled on the situation.

    Synopsis
    Titles and credits are shown over a view of the Earth from space, zooming in until we see the city below. We open in a room, the time is 1:30 p.m. and a woman lies asleep on a bed. Her name is Nora King (Kathleen Crowley) and despite what she thought was going to be a fatal overdose of sleeping pills, she wakes to an empty city. She soon discovers there is no water or electricity in her boarding house, and no people either. She exits the building and is confused as she wanders the deserted streets. She runs from street to street and finally finds a woman. She is dead and Nora recoils in horror. She backs away from the body and straight into a man smoking a cigarette with his jacket slung over his shoulder. Frank Brooks (Richard Denning) looks at Nora as she flees. He yells, ""Hey, wait a minute."" He chases her down an alley. He has her trapped so she picks up a brick and warns Frank, ""Don't come any closer."" He disarms, then slaps her. He explains that he won't hurt her and that he had nothing to do with the dead woman. They try to guess what has happened. They deduce that an evacuation was called, but are at a loss as to why.They walk through the empty streets. Frank breaks into an appliance store. He wants a portable radio to hear any news reports. They find one, but there are no batteries. They exit the store and hear a piano playing. They follow the sound and enter a bar/restaurant. Inside they find a woman in a cocktail dress at the piano drinking champagne. Vicki Harris (Virginia Grey) lights a cigarette and playfully calls to her long-time boyfriend, Jim Wilson (Richard Reeves) for more champagne. Slightly drunk he pops up from behind the bar with two bottles of Bollinger. Nora and Frank join the celebrating couple and ask, ""What are you two doing here?"" Vicki goes to the kitchen and prepares a turkey dinner. The four eat and drink. Nora suggests another club to visit five miles away.Out on the street, they find a car with the hood slightly ajar. When the men open the door for the ladies, a body of a dead man slumps towards the opening door. Frank and Jim remove the body while the ladies try to collect themselves. The men try to start the car with no success. Jim discovers the distributor cap loose and the rotor missing. Vicki and Nora return to the car. When Vicki asks what a missing rotor means, a man, Charles Otis (Mort Marshall) informs her, ""It means you can't get the engine started."" He explains to the four that he's been trying to get out of town, but all the cars he's found have the same problem. Otis explains he came from the north and the whole town is a wreck, windows are smashed, and houses and stores are wrecked. Everyone he has seen was dead. On the wall they see the shadow of some unidentifiable thing. They run to the safety of a nearby hotel.Safely inside they discover a newspaper. The headline reads, ""INVASION by Mystery Army."" An army invaded the day before and the city was ordered evacuated. Otis panics and runs for the door. Outside he spots a member of that army, a mechanical creature with a triangular body, flexible tube legs, metal boots, pincers on a pair of solid tube arms, and a trapezoidal head. The thing spots Otis and dispatches the man with a solid white beam of light. The beam emanates from an oval screen on its head. The two couples decide to stay in the hotel and secure a key to a suite on the fourth floor. They take the stairs to the room and lock themselves in.At Army headquarters near the city a meeting is taking place. Lt. General Wood (Arthur Space) briefs the assembled on the situation. The Colonel (Steve Pendleton) asks about the progress the scientists are making. He asks, ""Haven't they any idea where the enemy could have originated?"" The consensus is the planet Venus.
