                    One stormy night in the comfort of their luxurious parlor, Mary Shelley, her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley and their friend Lord Byron are discussing Mary's yet to be published book, Frankenstein, and what Percy believes to be its abrupt ending. Mary tells them that the book is not the end of the story, which she begins to tell... Dr. Henry Frankenstein did not perish at the hands of his monster, and his monster did not perish in the fire as most initially believed. Recuperating at home with his new wife Elizabeth, Henry is visited by Dr. Pretorius, a disgraced former colleague. Pretorius tries to blackmail Henry by various methods to continue his work in the creation of life in partnership with him, as Pretorius has been conducting his own similar experiments. Pretorius' methods have been different, his creation of life using seeds to grow humans, with different results, some better, some worse. As such, he believes their collaboration could use the best of both projects. What Pretorius' end goal is to create a woman so that Frankenstein's monster and this woman can procreate to form a new race. Even if he is able to pressure Henry into working with him, they have a few obstacles. The first is that the monster has escaped, with the authorities and vigilantes out to destroy him. The second is that the longer the monster is out in the world, the more he will be experiencing and learning, including from those equally marginalized, giving him a mind of his own. And third, of what Pretorius and Henry may be unaware, the monster and their new female creation being human may provide them with human attributes which factor into human coupling in its natural state.

While watching a demonstration of the fabulous powers of recall of ""Mr. Memory"" (Wylie Watson) shots are fired. In the ensuing panic, a frightened Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim) holds on to Hannay and talks him into taking her back to his flat. After the bus ride there, she admits that she is a counterspy, and that she fired the shots to cause confusion because she is being chased by assassins, who are standing outside on the street. She claims to know of a plot to steal vital British military secrets, masterminded by a man with the top joint missing from his little finger. To stop the plot, she needs to go to Scotland to a large house in a small village. She mentions ""thirty-nine steps"", but does not explain their meaning.That night, Annabella is stabbed in the back with Hannay's knife, but manages to warn him to flee before dying. She is clutching in her hand a map of Scotland with a tiny village circled. To sneak out of the watched flat he borrows the uniform of a milkman and soon boards a train to Scotland. He sees police searching the train and learns from a newspaper that he is the target of a nationwide manhunt as a murder suspect. To throw police off his track, he enters a compartment and kisses the only occupant, Pamela (Madeleine Carroll), and the searchers skip the compartment. She however frees herself from his unwanted embrace and alerts the policemen. The train stops right at the Forth rail bridge from having the emergency brake triggered and Hannay jumps onto the bridge and escapes. The police mount a huge effort to find him, that include his being chased from an autogyro, a precursor of the helicopter.He stays the night with a poor crofter (farmer) (John Laurie) and his young wife (Peggy Ashcroft), who realizes Hannay is on the run, but keeps quiet. The next morning, the husband is about to turn him in to a search party but he leaves, aided the wife, wearing the farmer's Sunday coat. He arrives on foot at his target village and calls at a house Annabella had described. A large party is going on, he gives the name Annabella Smith to the maid, and the owner lies to the arriving police so he doesn't get arrested. When he tells his story to the seemingly respectable Professor Jordan (Godfrey Tearle), Jordan reveals that he is missing the top joint of a finger. Jordan shoots Hannay and leaves him for dead, but luckily, the bullet stopped in the farmer's hymnbook, left in a coat pocket.Hannay drives to the local police after stealing the professor's car, but they refuse to believe his story, since they know Jordan well. He is arrested for the London murder. Hannay breaks through a glass window and mingles with a passing parade. He opens a door, finds himself at a political meeting, and is mistaken for the introductory speaker arriving a bit late. Without knowing a thing about the candidate he is introducing he improvises a rousing speech that becomes truly moving oratory as it picks up momentum. Hannay talks about a world in which no one is unjustly accused, no one is hunted, no nation plots against nation,He is recognized by Pamela, who alerts police once again. He is handcuffed and taken away by ""policemen"" in a car. Hannay realizes they are spy agents when they drive past the police station. He proves his theory by looking for a reaction from his captors when he mentions the boss who has a missing joint from his finger. When a flock of sheep blocks the narrow road, one of the henchmen handcuffs him to Pamela, as the captors exit the car and attempt to move the sheep, but he escapes, dragging the unwilling woman along. Hannay and the attached Pamela evade the spies by hiding under a bridge covered with sheep at one point and behind a waterfall at another, in a Chaplinesque sequence.They walk across the countryside and stay the night at an inn, Pamela is still skeptical about Hannay's story. The couple hide their handcuff problem by pretending to be unable to keep their hands off each other. The innkeeper's wife believes they are an illicit couple in love, and lies to protect them when there are inquiries as to who is staying at the inn. There are awkward moments when she takes off her wet stockings and they lie on the bed handcuffed. While he sleeps, she manages to slip out of her handcuff. On her way out, she hears one of the fake policemen on the telephone downstairs and the conversation confirms Hannay's story.She returns to the room and sleeps on a sofa. Next morning, she tells him what she heard, they return to London and she goes Scotland Yard with the tale of the spy plot. No secret documents have been reported missing however, so she is not believed. Instead, they follow her to find Hannay.She goes to meet Hannay at Mr. Memory's show at the London Palladium, finds him, and sits next to him. Hannay observes Professor Jordan in a box. As the performer is introduced, Hannay recognizes his theme music - it's an annoyingly catchy tune he hasn't been able to forget for days. Hannay puts two and two together and realizes that the spies are using Mr. Memory to smuggle the secrets out: he has them memorized so there are no paper documents. As the police take Hannay into custody, he shouts out a question: ""What are the 39 Steps?"" Mr. Memory compulsively begins to answer, ""The Thirty-Nine Steps is an organization of spies, collecting information on behalf of the foreign office of ...."" Jordan shoots him and tries to flee, but is apprehended. The dying Mr. Memory recites the information stored in his brain, formulas for the design for a silent aircraft engine.","

                    Richard Hannay is on the run from the police, who suspect him of murdering the woman found stabbed to death in his London flat. This story, including his photograph, are in many of the newspapers throughout Great Britain. In reality, the woman picked Hannay up at the Mr. Memory show at which they both attended, she telling him that there were two men there who were trying to kill her in an effort to obtain information which would breach national security. Hannay is not only on the run from police but is also trying to find out the nature of the potential national security breach in an effort to clear his name. All he knows from the dead woman is that it has something to do with a man in a small town in Scotland, another man who has part of his pinky finger missing and something called the 39 steps. As Hannay is on his journey of discovery all the while trying to elude both the police and the real murderers, he is forced out of circumstances outside of his control to take along a feisty young woman named Pamela whose continued belligerence toward him is despite her precarious situation.

    Synopsis
    Canadian Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) is at a London music hall. While watching a demonstration of the fabulous powers of recall of ""Mr. Memory"" (Wylie Watson) shots are fired. In the ensuing panic, a frightened Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim) holds on to Hannay and talks him into taking her back to his flat. After the bus ride there, she admits that she is a counterspy, and that she fired the shots to cause confusion because she is being chased by assassins, who are standing outside on the street. She claims to know of a plot to steal vital British military secrets, masterminded by a man with the top joint missing from his little finger. To stop the plot, she needs to go to Scotland to a large house in a small village. She mentions ""thirty-nine steps"", but does not explain their meaning.That night, Annabella is stabbed in the back with Hannay's knife, but manages to warn him to flee before dying. She is clutching in her hand a map of Scotland with a tiny village circled. To sneak out of the watched flat he borrows the uniform of a milkman and soon boards a train to Scotland. He sees police searching the train and learns from a newspaper that he is the target of a nationwide manhunt as a murder suspect. To throw police off his track, he enters a compartment and kisses the only occupant, Pamela (Madeleine Carroll), and the searchers skip the compartment. She however frees herself from his unwanted embrace and alerts the policemen. The train stops right at the Forth rail bridge from having the emergency brake triggered and Hannay jumps onto the bridge and escapes. The police mount a huge effort to find him, that include his being chased from an autogyro, a precursor of the helicopter.He stays the night with a poor crofter (farmer) (John Laurie) and his young wife (Peggy Ashcroft), who realizes Hannay is on the run, but keeps quiet. The next morning, the husband is about to turn him in to a search party but he leaves, aided the wife, wearing the farmer's Sunday coat. He arrives on foot at his target village and calls at a house Annabella had described. A large party is going on, he gives the name Annabella Smith to the maid, and the owner lies to the arriving police so he doesn't get arrested. When he tells his story to the seemingly respectable Professor Jordan (Godfrey Tearle), Jordan reveals that he is missing the top joint of a finger. Jordan shoots Hannay and leaves him for dead, but luckily, the bullet stopped in the farmer's hymnbook, left in a coat pocket.Hannay drives to the local police after stealing the professor's car, but they refuse to believe his story, since they know Jordan well. He is arrested for the London murder. Hannay breaks through a glass window and mingles with a passing parade. He opens a door, finds himself at a political meeting, and is mistaken for the introductory speaker arriving a bit late. Without knowing a thing about the candidate he is introducing he improvises a rousing speech that becomes truly moving oratory as it picks up momentum. Hannay talks about a world in which no one is unjustly accused, no one is hunted, no nation plots against nation,He is recognized by Pamela, who alerts police once again. He is handcuffed and taken away by ""policemen"" in a car. Hannay realizes they are spy agents when they drive past the police station. He proves his theory by looking for a reaction from his captors when he mentions the boss who has a missing joint from his finger. When a flock of sheep blocks the narrow road, one of the henchmen handcuffs him to Pamela, as the captors exit the car and attempt to move the sheep, but he escapes, dragging the unwilling woman along. Hannay and the attached Pamela evade the spies by hiding under a bridge covered with sheep at one point and behind a waterfall at another, in a Chaplinesque sequence.They walk across the countryside and stay the night at an inn, Pamela is still skeptical about Hannay's story. The couple hide their handcuff problem by pretending to be unable to keep their hands off each other. The innkeeper's wife believes they are an illicit couple in love, and lies to protect them when there are inquiries as to who is staying at the inn. There are awkward moments when she takes off her wet stockings and they lie on the bed handcuffed. While he sleeps, she manages to slip out of her handcuff. On her way out, she hears one of the fake policemen on the telephone downstairs and the conversation confirms Hannay's story.She returns to the room and sleeps on a sofa. Next morning, she tells him what she heard, they return to London and she goes Scotland Yard with the tale of the spy plot. No secret documents have been reported missing however, so she is not believed. Instead, they follow her to find Hannay.She goes to meet Hannay at Mr. Memory's show at the London Palladium, finds him, and sits next to him. Hannay observes Professor Jordan in a box. As the performer is introduced, Hannay recognizes his theme music - it's an annoyingly catchy tune he hasn't been able to forget for days. Hannay puts two and two together and realizes that the spies are using Mr. Memory to smuggle the secrets out: he has them memorized so there are no paper documents. As the police take Hannay into custody, he shouts out a question: ""What are the 39 Steps?"" Mr. Memory compulsively begins to answer, ""The Thirty-Nine Steps is an organization of spies, collecting information on behalf of the foreign office of ...."" Jordan shoots him and tries to flee, but is apprehended. The dying Mr. Memory recites the information stored in his brain, formulas for the design for a silent aircraft engine.

"12","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026778/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In Milan, wealthy dowager Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) has hired sly, wisecracking business manager Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) to help her enter society, but he merely helps himself to her money. At dinner in a fancy restaurant, he introduces her to opera impresario Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman). Gottlieb tries to persuade her to hire famed Italian tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King) for his New York opera company, and takes her to watch an opera performance with Lassparri as lead. Claypool is impressed and agrees to hire Lasspari for $1000 a night. Determined to cut himself a piece of the pie, Driftwood decides to sign Lassparri for the New York opera company first, and rushes backstage after the opera to find him.Back stage, Lassparri is a total jerk who beats his playful, mute assistant Tomasso (Harpo Marx). He tries to romance beautiful chorus member Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle). However, she has two problems with that - first, Lassparri is an arrogant, rude, egotistical brute, and second, she's in love with Riccardo Baroni (Allan Jones.) Riccardo sings in the chorus, hoping for his break to stardom. Riccardo meets up with his old friend Fiorello (Chico Marx), Tomasso's partner, who declares himself Riccardo's manager and decides to help him move further in the opera world. Looking to sign Lassparri before Gottlieb gets to him, Driftwood wanders backstage and runs into Fiorello, who claims to be the manager of the greatest tenor in the world. Excited, Driftwood whips out 2 questionable contracts for him and Fiorello to sign- however, due to Fiorello's stupidity and inability to read and Driftwood's sarcasm, a comical scene unfolds where they argue incessantly about clauses stating things like ""in this contract, the party of the first part shall be known as the party of the first part"" and so on. They end up ripping both contracts to shreds, though they both agree they have a contract. At this point, Gottlieb and Claypool arrive backstage and find Lassparri and sign him up - Fiorello informs a confused Driftwood that HE signed Riccardo Baroni!Gottlieb prepares to set sail for New York at once with Mrs. Claypool, Driftwood, and Lassparri. Also joining the group is Rosa, at Lassparri's request to have her as a leading lady; sadly, this means leaving Riccardo behind. As everyone boards the boat, Lassparri is begged by the papparazzi to sing for the crowd, but he feigns laryngitis: ""Why should I sing if I'm not being paid for it?"" Instead, Rosa sings ""Alone"", a popular love song. Riccardo, on the dock, joins in. While he is singing, Rosa asks Gottlieb to consider bringing Riccardo along. He tells her that Riccardo has a nice voice, but will have to wait until he has developed a reputation.On the boat, Driftwood finds Rosa crying and delivers to her a love letter from Riccardo to cheer her up. As the smartass conman rides luggage carts to his room, he finds that Gottlieb's set him up in a room no bigger than a storage closet, in which his suitcase takes up half the room. An angry Driftwood opens his luggage to find his clothes gone, and that Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo have stowed away inside: after all, Driftwood DID sign Riccardo to the company. Not wanting to get caught with the illegal stowaways, Driftwood demands the 3 leave: Fiorello will only leave after they've been fed. Driftwood then orders multiple plates of food (with multiple hard-boiled eggs) to the room.What begins now is the ""stateroom scene"", one of the most famous comedy scenes of all time. Already crowded in the closet-sized room are Driftwood, Fiorello, Tomasso, Riccardo, and the giant suitcase. Slowly, more people begin crowding in the room: two maids come in to make the bed, the engineer and his large assistant come in to fix the heat, and a manicurist shows up to do Driftwood's nails. The already too-small room becomes too crowded as all this action takes place at the same time, and Driftwood continues to let more people in: a cleaning woman comes in to clean up, a young woman looking for her Aunt Minnie tries to use the phone, and finally, the servers with all the food. All these people try to fit in the room with their seperate duties as a smirking Driftwood remarks, ""Say, is it my imagination or is it getting crowded in here?"" Finally, Mrs. Claypool comes by and opens the door, and all 15 people come crashing out of the room into the hallway.That night, there are festivities going up on the ship's main deck, including a big dinner where Lassparri tries hitting on Rosa, who rejects him yet again, and a dance. An honor is given to three famous aviators with large beards, who are traveling to New York City for a large ceremony. Mrs. Claypool tells Driftwood she doesn't want him associating with Fiorello and Tomasso, as they are riff-raff, far below her social class. Meanwhile, bored inside their stateroom, Fiorello, Tomasso and Riccardo sneak up to the main deck and help themselves to dinner. Afterwards, Fiorello starts to play the piano and Tomasso plays the harp, much to the enjoyment of the children on board. However, Lassparri spots the three stowaways and informs the crewmembers: they chase the stowaways and throw them into the detention cabin.Locked up in the brig the next day, Tomasso plays the harmonica much to Fiorello's annoyance, who throws the harmonica out the window into the ocean. Tomasso jumps out the window and into the ocean to get his harmonica. Driftwood, spotting Tomasso from an open window, tosses him the rope to the anchor. Tomasso grabs on to the rope and is lifted back up on to the ship, landing in the stateroom of the three bearded aviators, who lay in bed asleep. Seeing as how the stowaways are illegally entering the country, Tomasso gets an idea to get them safely into New York City, takes out a pair of scissors, and goes to work...The boat docks in New York City. When the papparazzi try to get the 3 aviators from their room, Driftwood impersonates as their manager, and takes the bearded ""aviators"" - Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo wearing the shaved-beards as disguises- off the boat. The 3 real aviators are left tied up and gagged to their bed. The ""aviators"" and Driftwood are taken to a large ceremony at City Hall, where thousands upon thousands of people stand audience in the city, watching. The Mayor presents the 3 aviators with awards and asks them to talk about their accomplishments. Fiorello gives a fake, messed up speech to the crowds, while Tomasso drinks multiple glasses of water to stall time, leading Police Sgt. Henderson (Robert Emmett O'Connor) to suspect that the trio are imposters. The trio pretend to be offended by the sergeant's accusations and storm off, leading him to apologize to the Mayor and Tomasso. Tomasso hugs him- but when he does, his fake beard comes off, exposing their ruse. Everyone goes mad trying to catch the illegal frauds as they escape.Word is out all over New York City and on the front page of the next day's newspapers as police look for Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo. Driftwood, hiding the trio in his hotel room as to avoid arrest and deportation, shows the news to them and demands they leave before he gets arrested. Before they can, Sgt. Henderson comes knocking at the door to investigate Driftwood's room. As Driftwood tries to slyly deal with Henderson and make him leave, Fiorello Tomasso and Riccardo hide on the fire escape between the kitchen area and the bedroom. As Henderson moves back and forth between the two rooms, the three stowaways use the fire escape to move furniture from the bedroom into the kitchen, leading Henderson to believe he's losing his mind and gone crazy until Driftwood finally gets him to leave.The day of the big opera finally arrives: Il Trovatore starring Lassparri and Rosa. As Rosa prepares in her room, Riccardo visits and they reunite. However, Lassparri enters and becomes disappointed when he sees the two together, and angry when Riccardo kicks him out of the room. Meanwhile, Driftwood arrives at the theater and gets a happy reception from the chorus: only for Gottlieb to tell Driftwood that Mrs. Claypool has officially dispensed with his services for associating with the riffraff (Fiorello and Tomasso), and he is fired. Driftwood is kicked down the staircase and thrown out of the theater, now unemployed.Out of a job, out of money, and kicked out of his hotel, Driftwood is left with nothing else but a bench in Central Park, with Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo still with him. Incredibly resentful of how his life is pretty much ruined, he wishes he never met any of them and to be back in Milan. Rosa shows up heartbroken and in tears: she informs the group that, because she doesn't love Lassparri, Lassparri persuaded Gottlieb to fire her from the opera, and she has been replaced with another diva. Fed up with how far Gottlieb and Lassparri have gone, Driftwood decides enough is enough: he begins to plot revenge, the way only the Marx Brothers can...That night, crowds have filled the big theater to see the opera. Gottlieb arrives in a fancy suit and enters his office: only to find Driftwood, Tomasso, and Fiorello smoking his cigars and eating his dinner. As he tries to call the police, the three of them knock him out and strip him of his clothes, which Driftwood puts on. Their plan has begun: destroy the opera. Driftwood takes Gottlieb's spot in the box seat next to Mrs. Claypool, and delivers a smart-mouthed speech to the audience as the orchestra gets ready. However, sitting in the orchestra causing trouble are Fiorello and Tomasso, who distract the maestro by tapping on instruments. Gottlieb, having woken up and put on Driftwood's too-small clothes, gets to the orchestra box to catch Driftwood, he jumps out and runs for it. Gottlieb sends his men after him and calls the police.What happens next is 7 minutes of the most amazing operatic mayhem ever to visit the movie screen.Fiorello and Tomasso have inserted ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" into the musicians' sheet music. When they reach that point and start playing it, the two begin playing baseball in the orchestra, as Driftwood walks around the audience selling peanuts. Gottlieb chases Fiorello and Tomasso into the storage area under the stage, where they knock him out yet again. Driftwood remains running around the opera house, making snarky comments towards everything as Gottlieb's men chase him.The curtain rises and the opera begins... with Fiorello and Tomasso in costume on the stage with the chorus. They begin to run amok, ripping off singers' clothing and generally causing havoc in the scene. Sgt. Henderson and his police guards arrive backstage, ready to catch and arrest Driftwood and his illegal friends. They find Gottlieb and wake him up, and inform him that the 3 are still out there, sabotaging the opera. Dressing up in costume, the 2 men sneak on to the stage in the middle of the scene to catch Tomasso. However, he escapes by climbing up the backdrop of the stage and disappearing into the rafters of the opera house. He then begins swinging, Tarzan-style, on the ropes and pulleys backstage. This causes various inappropriate backdrops--vendor pushcarts, trolleybuses, and a battleship--to move up and down on the stage while Lassparri is singing. In one case a backdrop is actually in front of Lassparri. Tomasso then swings directly over the stage, making a daring flying snatch of Lassparri's wig.The police are chasing him all over the backstage area, also swinging on ropes. When Tomasso is cornered, he jumps directly down a backdrop, tearing it in two. The police corner him on the ground, and he runs/climbs back UP the backdrop, then swings on a rope over to the electrical control panel.He turns off all the lights. Lassparri, still singing solo despite the chaos, suddenly starts to scream but is silenced. When the power is restored, Lassparri is missing! While it was dark, Fiorello and Driftwood have kidnapped, bound, and gagged him, and put him in a box hanging up in the rafters. The box is held up by the ropes controlled by Tomasso. The 4 are completely out of sight of anyone below.Gottlieb is in a panic. He needs a tenor for the next song. Suddenly, Riccardo and Rosa walk in. Gottlieb begs Riccardo to sing lead in the opera. Riccardo points out that he ""has no reputation,"" (as Gottlieb had pointed out at the start of the voyage.) He demands that his counterpart in the duet be Rosa, since they have practiced it. Gottlieb has no choice but to put both of them in costume and send them out on stage.Riccardo and Rosa put on an amazing performance of the sad duet ""Miserere"". In contrast to the preceding raucous goings-on, the audience now pays rapt and appreciative attention to the new singers. Even Gottlieb is impressed. (Ms. Carlisle and Mr. Jones were classically trained; they did their own singing.) At the end of the song, there is thunderous applause. After Riccardo and Rosa go off stage, Lassparri is released. He angrily demands to go out on stage, saying ""I'll sing them an encore that they will never forget."" But the audience will have nothing of this. They boo him off the stage. He storms out of the opera house.Gottlieb's course of action is clear. Riccardo and Rosa will be the new stars of the opera company. After quickly consenting to a few demands--all criminal charges will be dropped, and Driftwood will get his job back--he sends the two back on stage for an encore before the enthusiastic audience. All ends happily, or will end happily as soon as Driftwood, Fiorello, and Gottlieb can agree on a contract. Which requires agreement about the role of the ""party of the tenth part.""","

    Synopsis
    In Milan, wealthy dowager Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) has hired sly, wisecracking business manager Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) to help her enter society, but he merely helps himself to her money. At dinner in a fancy restaurant, he introduces her to opera impresario Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman). Gottlieb tries to persuade her to hire famed Italian tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King) for his New York opera company, and takes her to watch an opera performance with Lassparri as lead. Claypool is impressed and agrees to hire Lasspari for $1000 a night. Determined to cut himself a piece of the pie, Driftwood decides to sign Lassparri for the New York opera company first, and rushes backstage after the opera to find him.Back stage, Lassparri is a total jerk who beats his playful, mute assistant Tomasso (Harpo Marx).

Her father, Judge Thatcher (Samuel S. Hinds) takes the phone and begs Vollin to save his daughters life. He refuses and hangs up. Finding out where the doctor lives, he goes to Vollins home and continues begging in person. Vollin appears to have no compassion or sympathy for her and refuses. Thatcher appeals to him as a doctor who has taken an oath, to which Vollin replies, I make no such oath. I am a law unto myself. Death hasnt the same significance for me as it has for you, Vollin concludes. Insisting that Vollin save her life, Thatcher is told by Vollin that the other doctors are competent. It is only when told that everyone says that Dr. Vollin is the only one who can save her that he rises, puffed up, saying, So, they DO say that I'm the only one? Very well, I will go.The operation proceeds, with Vollin being shown as having an unusual interest in the patients beauty.One month later, Jean is being entertained by Vollin in his home. Having listened to him play Bachs Toccata and Fugue in D Minor  on organ, she gushes that Vollin is not only a brilliant surgeon but a great musician. She intimates that maybe he is more than an extraordinary man, to which he eagerly answers a god? With the taint of human emotions. She tells him she wishes she could repay him for saving her life. Clutching her and staring into her eyes he tells her the restraint we put upon ourselves can drive us mad. Uncomfortable, she makes an excuse to leave, reminding him of her performance the following night. Nothing can keep me away, he promises. She tells him she will have a surprise for him that night and leaves.The next evening a show marquee sign tells of her performance in a dance interpretation of Poes  The Raven . She dances while a man dressed as Poe (Raine Bennett) recites the poem. In one of the balcony box seats, Thatcher observes Vollin madly obsessing over his daughters performance.Afterwards backstage, Jerry reassures Jean that the audience liked her performance, saying that twelve encores was enough. Entering the dressing room to congratulate her include Pinkey (Ian Wolfe) and Mary Burns (Inez Courtney), her father and Dr. Vollin, who kisses her hand, gushing about her surprise Poe interpretation. Again, Thatcher observes Vollin taking more than a casual interest in Jean.The next day Thatcher arrives at Vollins to tell him to leave Jean alone. She is in danger of becoming infatuated with you. We cant let her get any ideas about you, can we?  the judge intones, She is engaged to young Jerry Holden, he tells Vollin. Speaking of his interest in Jean, Vollin crushes a test tube in his hand. This convinces Thatcher that Vollin is seriously involved in a similar infatuation. Told to leave her alone, Vollin insists that the judge bring his daughter to him. I find you stark staring mad, Thatcher tells him and leaves.Edmond Bateman (Boris Karloff), an escaped convict trying to disguise himself is given the address of Dr. Vollin in a local tavern. He arrives that evening and is invited into Vollins office. When Vollin addresses him by name, Bateman wants to know who told him. It is explained that Batemans violent prison break and photo were in the newspapers. Vollin seems very interested that Batemans bank robbery and mutilation of a bank cashier's face with an acetylene torch was especially torturous. Come to ask Vollin to change his face so he will not be recognized, Bateman is promised help but only if he agrees to commit murder and torture. Desperate, he agrees and is told the alteration will be done now. Bateman is led into a room and made to lie on a table for surgery.Later, a bandaged Bateman is checked on by the doctor. When the patient awakens, Vollin raises him up vertically and begins slowly removing the bandages. As his face is revealed, half of it is shown to be horribly disfigured and one eye dislocated. Bateman speaks in a raspy voice, asking if he looks different. Yes, Vollin replies with noted glee. Feeling something is not right with his face, Bateman feels with his fingers and demands to see his reflection. Dr. Vollin agrees and leaves the room, telling him to wait. As Bateman gets up and looks around, several curtains are opened, revealing a series of large mirrors, each one reflecting the ugliness of Bateman one by one. Horrified, he begins shooting, breaking each mirror. From a grate near the ceiling, Vollin appears, laughing hysterically at Batemans misery. Having run out of bullets, Bateman frustratingly throws the gun at Vollin's face.Moments later Vollin asks Bateman if he is ready to do the murder job, telling him he must answer yes or no. Bateman insists that his face be fixed but Vollin says he must do this job for him first. He agrees. Vollin returns to the room a moment later, giving Bateman some clothes to put on and then report for further instructions.Having invited Jean, Jerry, Pinkey, Mary and Col. Bertram Grant (Spencer Charters) and his wife Harriet (Maidel Turner) to a party, they make bets on a horserace game which is mechanically run in Dr. Vollins home. At one point Jean announces she will have to go upstairs to fix her hair and does so, which is noted by Vollin and Bateman, who now serves as the butler. Meanwhile, Judge Thatcher arrives home to find Vollins written invitation to the party, to which also a note added that Jean and Jerry decided to go and for her father to join them.When Thatcher arrives, Vollin immediately apologizes for what he said the other day, asking him to forgive him. The judge seems reluctant but is quickly reassured by Vollin, who joyfully leads him into the party. Bateman is told to go upstairs and tell Jean her father has arrived. When he opens the door and Jean sees Bateman in the mirror behind her, she screams and runs downstairs into her fathers arms. Everyone crowds around as she tells of this awful man who came into her room. Vollin interrupts and tells everyone to come and sit while he tells the story of his servants unfortunate disfigurement. His guests are told with some relish how he served with Vollin in his regiment and was tortured by the enemy, who mutilated his face. Describing his interest in death and torture, he makes a reference to Poe. Jean asks what is Vollins interpretation of  The Raven  and is told that Poe was a great genius who was denied his love, Lenore. Getting tired, it is suggested that they all retire to their rooms for the night and they begin going upstairs. When Jean passes Bateman, she apologizes, saying she was suddenly surprised and would not have screamed if she had known. Bateman sees this sympathetic gesture and acts as if he wants to tell his secret. Vollin notices Bateman talking to Jean and is concerned.Outside a windy thunderstorm is beating down trees.Upstairs, Judge Thatcher is shown to his room by Vollin, who is called over by Col. Grant and asked about drafts in the house. Assured they will be comfortable, the Colonel and his wife go upstairs to the third floor where their room is. Thatcher comes into Jeans room with Jerry and begins ranting again about Vollin being mad and dangerous. He tells the couple to come home with him now. His fears are laughed at by Jerry, who says Vollin is just being amusing and is too reputable and distinguished a surgeon to be considered dangerous. Against his better judgment Thatcher resigns himself to stay the night, but not before Jerry announces that he will switch rooms with Jean for her protection.Knocking on the door and entering, Bateman comes in to try to tell Judge Thatcher what is going on. Vollins voice is heard calling Bateman. Coming to the door, he chastises Bateman into going downstairs. Trying to reassure his guests, Vollin apologizes and says his servant probably just wanted to see if he could help them. Jean says they are now comfortable and Vollin bids them goodnight.Going down into a dungeon below, Vollin shows Bateman his instruments of torture, telling him many are described by Poe in his writings. He says they are very old but warns ready for use.He shows Bateman a slab with manacles for feet and arms to hold a man still for the Pit and Pendulum device. Getting up on the slab to demonstrate, Vollin shows how a man may be held captive by throwing a lever. Bateman quickly throws the lever, which traps Vollin. Gotcha! Bateman says grimly. As the pendulum swings slowly back and forth over him, Vollin tells Bateman to release him, reminding him that should anything happen to me, you remain the horrible monster you are. Bateman reluctantly releases him. Vollin tells him the blade descends upon the victim in fifteen minutes time which can be seen on a clock built into the stone wall.Later Bateman comes up through a trap door into Jeans room, but suddenly the wind causes a tree to crash through the window, awakening Jean. Looking around, she sees Bateman, who retreats and closes the trap door. She screams and runs to Jerrys room, telling him she is frightened. They go into her room and Jerry tells her its only a tree which the storm blew into the window. She says she saw a man coming up through the floor, which he amusingly thinks is her imagination. He tells her to sleep in his room, and he will stay in hers.In Vollins office, he tells Bateman at gunpoint to leave the girl alone and strikes him with a small whip. Just then a knock at the door interrupts them. The Colonel wants a sleeping powder for his wife. Dr. Vollin comes back with two powders, telling him there is one for each of them. Vollin tells Bateman that now the job will begin.Sneaking into Thatchers room, Bateman strong-arms him out of bed and downstairs to the torture chamber. Along the way Thatchers cries are heard by Jerry, who attempts to locate him. They enter Vollins study through the bookcase panel entrance into a passageway down below. Bateman punches Jerry and prevents him from entering, closing the door. Below, Thatcher is brought before a waiting Vollin, who apologizes to the judge for the savagery of his servant. Bateman is told to put Thatcher on the slab. The blade is turned on and Thatcher asks about it. Vollin tells him it will reach him in fifteen minutes. He explains that he is the sanest man of all because he removes torture from his life by torturing others. Judge Thatcher nervously watches the swinging pendulum as Vollin laughs maniacally. Meanwhile, Jerry comes to and tries to find how to open the bookcase entrance.Vollin goes to a master control and throws a switch which lowers Jeans bedroom down to the dungeon. He watches Jean screaming as the large elevator reaches the bottom where he is laughing at her. Closing the door, he seems amused by her cries. Unable to open the panel, Jerry runs upstairs to Jeans room and opens the door as he hears her cries. Holding onto the doorknob, he swings in midair where the room has been lowered. He is barely able to recover and go out the door again. He calls for the others to help him and they follow. He explains that Jean and her father have been taken and to wake the Grants. A few minutes later Jerry is told that the Grants seem to have been drugged and cannot be awakened. They try to find the opening to the bookcase panel. Jerry picks up the phone to call, but this is anticipated by Vollin, who switches off the phones from his control. At the same time another switch lowers steel shutters on all the windows, sealing them in.Vollin tells Bateman to quiet the girl. As he goes to do this, Vollin tells Thatcher that he has  a most delightful plan for her. Bateman opens the door and tells Jean he said to stop. She stares at his face. He tells her he knows he is ugly and that Vollin did it. Saying Vollin is mad, she asks Bateman to help her get out. He says no, because the doctor will fix his face. She tells Bateman that Vollin wont help him but that she will. He is called back by Vollin and told to attend to Thatcher.Vollin now opens the bookcase door and Jerry says he will go in. The others follow. Finding a passageway leading downstairs to the dungeon, Jerry sees Bateman standing by Thatcher and a fight ensues. Vollin holds a gun on Jean. Jerry runs to where Jean is standing with Vollin. Bateman approaches and holds Jerry. Meanwhile, Thatcher tells the others to release him from the slab. When told the lever is locked, Thatcher tells them the servant must have the key. They rush in and see Jean and Jerry held at gunpoint by Vollin. He tells them they are in time for a wedding. He tells Bateman to open the room door, and then tells Jean and Jerry to go in. The switch is thrown to close the steel door. They are told they will remain in this room forever and that their love will make it beautiful. Bateman comes over and asks Vollin what happens in that room. He is told that it is another of Poes stories: the room where the walls come together. Dr. Vollin now loudly proclaims that his torture is complete and that Poe is avenged. Bateman asks if they will be crushed. Vollin says yes, telling Bateman that he will fix his face now. Again Bateman asks if the girl will be crushed to death and is told yes. He tells Vollin no and goes to throw the switch. Vollin threatens him and when the switch is thrown Bateman is shot and staggers. Getting the key, Pinkey goes and frees Thatcher.There is a struggle between Bateman and Vollin, who is knocked out and dragged into the room by Bateman as the couple emerges. Bateman rushes to close the door. Vollin cries out to Bateman as the door closes and the walls close in to crush him. When Bateman and Vollin are dead, Mary screams and says we forgot the Grants! They are shown snoring in their beds.Jean and Jerry are seen driving home and she says she was almost crushed. He jokes that he will finish the process, only softer. She tells him that he is now the big bad raven.","

Vollin restores her completely, but also envisions her as his ""Lenore,"" and cooks up a scheme to kidnap the woman and torture and kill her fiance' and father in his Poe-inspired dungeon. To do his dirty work, Vollin recruits a wanted criminal (Karloff), and turns him into a hideous monster to guarantee his subservience.

                    This is by far the best version of Les Misérables ever made in my opinion and the critics. Charles Laughton makes this movie, but literally every scene and every character add to this amazing film. If you have never seen a Charles Laughton movie this one will get you hooked. His portrayal of Inspector Javert is 2nd to none. He tracks the wanted man Jean Valjean throughout the movie and the twists and turns are so well done even you movie buffs will not see what's coming. The movie takes you through Valjeans life and many crossroads that shape his life. My words don't do this movie justice. This is a must see Drama. The scene with the priest always gets to me, be sure to catch all the dialog. This movie will make you laugh though it is not a comedy. It will make you mad. It will move your heart in a good way. You will become many of the characters as you watch the film. The less you know about the film the better in my opinion which is why my summary is so vague on details. You can only see a movie for the first time once so enjoy it. I know I did. And this is one of those you can see over and over through the years and it always gives you something more.

                    It's the early days of the F.B.I. - federal agents working for the Department of Justice. Though they've got limited powers - they don't carry weapons and have to get local police approval for arrests - that doesn't stop fresh Law School grad Eddie Buchanan from joining up, and he encourages his former roommate James ""Brick"" Davis (James Cagney) to do so as well. But Davis wants to be an honest lawyer, not a shyster, despite his ties to mobster boss McKay, and he's intent on doing so, until Buchanan is gunned down trying to arrest career criminal Danny Leggett. Davis soon joins the ""G-Men"" as they hunt down Leggett (soon-to-be Public Enemy Number One) and his cronies Collins and Durfee, who are engaged in a crime and murder spree from New York to the midwest.

Davis' schooling was actually paid by a friend, Mac McKay, a benevolent mobster who wanted to make sure that Brick didn't end up on the wrong side of the law. He hasn't been very successful as a lawyer so law enforcement seems to be the next best thing. When mobsters go on a spree of bank robberies in the US mid-west, Davis is assigned to the Chicago field office. As they arrest the mobsters one by one, Davis learns that the rest of the gang is hiding out at a hotel run by his onetime friend and mentor McKay. Things come to a head when the last remaining gunman kidnaps a fellow G-Man's sister.

To avoid arrest, he decides to travel to England smuggling a few pieces of lace with which he can start life anew. Although he initially decides not to take his daughter Sylvia with him, she convinces him to go along as she will disguise herself as a boy named Sylvester, the disguise as the authorities would not be looking for a man and his son. Along the way, they meet a con artist named Jimmy Monkley. Although their initial encounter does include a con, they ultimately decide to go into the grifting business together. When that doesn't pan out, they instead decide to use one of their fronts, as a traveling performance troupe of pierrots, for real, which will include one of Jimmy's friends, a simpleminded Cockney maid named Maudie Tilt. Complications ensue when Henry falls for Maudie, and Sylvia falls for an artist named Michael Fane, who they meet during one of their performances. Sylvia has to decide whether to come out as a girl not only to Michael, but to Jimmy and Maudie as well. The course to true love may be difficult for both Henry and Sylvia, the latter who has the further obstacle of a refined Russian woman named Lily Levetsky who seems to be the object of Michael's affections.

                    In the small town of South Renford, Alice Adams comes from a working class background, although she aspires to be among the upper class. Alice's mother blames her husband for their low social standing, despite his working hard and Alice not blaming him for anything. Regardless, Alice tries to do whatever necessary to put on appearances of wealth and social standing, despite everyone in that class in town knowing who she is, and thus largely ignoring her because of her false airs. First meeting at a society ball, Alice surprisingly catches the eye of Arthur Russell, surprisingly as he purportedly is engaged to débutante Mildred Palmer. As Alice continues to hide her true social standing from Arthur as he courts her, Mrs. Adams pressures Mr. Adams into doing something he doesn't want to do in an effort truly to become part of the business class, that measure which entails sinking all his money into a business venture. Beyond the time when Arthur finds out the true nature behind Alice's facade, other issues may bring the fragile Adams society house of cards tumbling down around them, and thus the happiness Alice is seeking with Arthur.

Later Professor Arnold, head of the expedition, vanishes mysteriously on a trip to the Upper Nile. When pieces of the excavated treasure begin to turn up on the antiquities black market, Charlie Chan is brought in by the expedition's underwriters, the French Archeaological Society, to investigate. While examining the inventory, Chan discovers that the mummy wrappings of the ancient priest contain the murdered body of the missing archaeologist. Among the suspects are Professor Thurston, who admits to surreptitiously selling the artifacts to pay for the expeditions continued support, Dr. Racine, who believes his financial contribution to the enterprise entitles him to a share of the treasure, Tom Evans, an archaeologist fired by Arnold, Snowshoes, a servant claiming to be descended from Ameti, and Edfu Ahmed, who still believes in the ancient deities and objects to the plunder of the tomb. Another murder and other attempted murders will occur before Chan reveals the identity and motive of the real killer.

Becky and Amelia are girls at school together, but Becky is from a ""show biz"" family, or in other words, very low class. Becky manages to insinuate herself in Amelia's family and gets to know all their friends. From this possibly auspicious- beginning, she manages to ruin her own life, becoming sick, broke, and lonely, and also ruins the lives of many other ""loved ones"".

"45","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026144/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film opens with a radio broadcast where Harry Stockwell (himself) sings an excerpt of ""Broadway Melody,"" which had been introduced in the first film of the Broadway Melody series, followed by Frances Langford (herself) crooning ""You Are My Lucky Star,"" one of this film's most famous songs. When her vocal concludes, Bert Keeler (Jack Benny), an obnoxious gossip columnist from the World Tribune, presents his column radio-style, but all he talks about is who is having a baby. Back at the newspaper office, his editor forbids any more writing about babies and tells him to dig up some dirt or else. In his office, Keelers assistant, Snoop (Sid Silvers), sees theatrical producer, Bob Gordon (Robert Taylor), dancing with the wealthy widow, Lillian Brent (June Knight), on a rooftop across the street. She offers to finance Gordons new show and appeals to him to not forget about her while he works on his show. That leads into the song ""I've Got a Feeling You're Fooling"" sung by Bob and Lillian (later at an audition for Bobs show, Frances Langford sings a short reprise of the song). During their rendition, flowers, furniture, a piano, and a table complete with a meal, magically pop out of the floor. A girls chorus sings and watches Basil (Nick Long, Jr.), Bobs assistant, tap. He magically makes the white clad girls disappear and replaces them with the same group of girls dressed in black. Basil performs a very acrobatic dance before he dances with Lillian. The girls chorus sings again as the number ends with Lillian and Bob at the bar. After watching all of this, Bert Keeler quickly surmises that ""any time a wealthy Park Avenue widow gets chummy with a Broadway guy, one of them's got something the other wants."" In the next scene, Irene Foster (Eleanor Powell) arrives at Bobs office. She explains to his secretary, Kitty Corbett (Una Merkel), that she and Bob had been high school sweethearts five years ago in their hometown of Albany. Keeler comes to Bob's office after a scoop, but instead encounters a man whose talent was snoring (Robert Wildhack), which he gladly demonstrates. For some unknown reason, this snoring man is a recurring annoyance several times during the film. When Bob breezes into his office, he doesnt recognize Irene. As Irene is unpacking in her newly rented tenement apartment, she hears tap dancing on the roof and goes to investigate. She finds Ted (Buddy Ebsen) and Sally (Vilma Ebsen), a brother and sister act, preparing to eat breakfast at noon. Ted tells her it's cheaper to eat that way. While waiting for their coffee to brew, the duo performs an exuberant song and tap dance routine to ""Sing Before Breakfast."" When it ends, Irene applauds and is invited to join them. After introductions, Ted says he doesnt believe in bad luck taboos like walking under a ladder and singing before breakfast. After some more singing, the long-legged Irene performs a solo. All three join in the fun again and sing and dance their exit. When Bob's secretary helps him remember Irene, he orders Kitty to find her, so she convinces Snoop to ask Keeler to print in his column that Bob is looking for Irene. The wealthy widow, Lillian, burst into Bob's office furious about Keeler's less-than-flattering column about their relationship. Bob dashes down to the columnists office to punch him (similar to the recurrence of the snoring man, Bob punching Keeler occurs several times during the film). Ted and Sally show Keeler's next column about Bob looking for her to Irene, but she stubbornly refuses to see him again, however, she eventually relents and shows up at the audition for the show. Bob takes her aside and discourages her from getting mixed up in the sordid show business world. When he is called to his office, Irene is left sitting alone in the audience. She imagines what it would be like to sing and dance in the theater (""You Are My Lucky Star,"" Miss Powell's vocals were dubbed by Marjorie Lane). During the number, Irene dances in a ballet in toe shoes. Back in Bob's office, Lillian, his wealthy backer, now wants to be the show's leading lady. To be a success, he thinks the show needs a star, but promises if he can't find one in two weeks he'll allow Lillian to star. Bob leaves for the West Coast to search for his star.Keeler suggests to Kitty that Bob get LaBelle Arlette, a French actress he invented, as his star. Keeler continues the charade by building his invention up in his columns and on his radio show; he even rents a room for her at the Hotel Carlton. When Bob returns empty handed from his Hollywood venture, Kitty tells him about LaBelle Arlette and asks why he doesn't hire her. Bob gives Ted and Sally parts in his production and sends Irene back to Albany by train, but she gets off the train to meet Kitty; they have something cooked up.In the next scene, Ted and Sally perform a dress rehearsal of their number in Bob's show, ""On a Sunday Afternoon,"" a Gay Nineties-type number. Just as Gordon gives in to Lillian's demands to star, Irene shows up at his office as LaBelle Arlette; Bob doesn't recognize her again. He quickly signs her for his show.

    Synopsis
    The film opens with a radio broadcast where Harry Stockwell (himself) sings an excerpt of ""Broadway Melody,"" which had been introduced in the first film of the Broadway Melody series, followed by Frances Langford (herself) crooning ""You Are My Lucky Star,"" one of this film's most famous songs. When her vocal concludes, Bert Keeler (Jack Benny), an obnoxious gossip columnist from the World Tribune, presents his column radio-style, but all he talks about is who is having a baby. Back at the newspaper office, his editor forbids any more writing about babies and tells him to dig up some dirt or else. In his office, Keelers assistant, Snoop (Sid Silvers), sees theatrical producer, Bob Gordon (Robert Taylor), dancing with the wealthy widow, Lillian Brent (June Knight), on a rooftop across the street. She offers to finance Gordons new show and appeals to him to not forget about her while he works on his show. That leads into the song ""I've Got a Feeling You're Fooling"" sung by Bob and Lillian (later at an audition for Bobs show, Frances Langford sings a short reprise of the song). During their rendition, flowers, furniture, a piano, and a table complete with a meal, magically pop out of the floor. A girls chorus sings and watches Basil (Nick Long, Jr.), Bobs assistant, tap. He magically makes the white clad girls disappear and replaces them with the same group of girls dressed in black. Basil performs a very acrobatic dance before he dances with Lillian. The girls chorus sings again as the number ends with Lillian and Bob at the bar. After watching all of this, Bert Keeler quickly surmises that ""any time a wealthy Park Avenue widow gets chummy with a Broadway guy, one of them's got something the other wants."" In the next scene, Irene Foster (Eleanor Powell) arrives at Bobs office. She explains to his secretary, Kitty Corbett (Una Merkel), that she and Bob had been high school sweethearts five years ago in their hometown of Albany. Keeler comes to Bob's office after a scoop, but instead encounters a man whose talent was snoring (Robert Wildhack), which he gladly demonstrates. For some unknown reason, this snoring man is a recurring annoyance several times during the film. When Bob breezes into his office, he doesnt recognize Irene. As Irene is unpacking in her newly rented tenement apartment, she hears tap dancing on the roof and goes to investigate. She finds Ted (Buddy Ebsen) and Sally (Vilma Ebsen), a brother and sister act, preparing to eat breakfast at noon. Ted tells her it's cheaper to eat that way. While waiting for their coffee to brew, the duo performs an exuberant song and tap dance routine to ""Sing Before Breakfast."" When it ends, Irene applauds and is invited to join them. After introductions, Ted says he doesnt believe in bad luck taboos like walking under a ladder and singing before breakfast. After some more singing, the long-legged Irene performs a solo. All three join in the fun again and sing and dance their exit. When Bob's secretary helps him remember Irene, he orders Kitty to find her, so she convinces Snoop to ask Keeler to print in his column that Bob is looking for Irene. The wealthy widow, Lillian, burst into Bob's office furious about Keeler's less-than-flattering column about their relationship. Bob dashes down to the columnists office to punch him (similar to the recurrence of the snoring man, Bob punching Keeler occurs several times during the film). Ted and Sally show Keeler's next column about Bob looking for her to Irene, but she stubbornly refuses to see him again, however, she eventually relents and shows up at the audition for the show. Bob takes her aside and discourages her from getting mixed up in the sordid show business world. When he is called to his office, Irene is left sitting alone in the audience. She imagines what it would be like to sing and dance in the theater (""You Are My Lucky Star,"" Miss Powell's vocals were dubbed by Marjorie Lane). During the number, Irene dances in a ballet in toe shoes. Back in Bob's office, Lillian, his wealthy backer, now wants to be the show's leading lady. To be a success, he thinks the show needs a star, but promises if he can't find one in two weeks he'll allow Lillian to star. Bob leaves for the West Coast to search for his star.
Keeler suggests to Kitty that Bob get LaBelle Arlette, a French actress he invented, as his star. Keeler continues the charade by building his invention up in his columns and on his radio show; he even rents a room for her at the Hotel Carlton. When Bob returns empty handed from his Hollywood venture, Kitty tells him about LaBelle Arlette and asks why he doesn't hire her. Bob gives Ted and Sally parts in his production and sends Irene back to Albany by train, but she gets off the train to meet Kitty; they have something cooked up.
In the next scene, Ted and Sally perform a dress rehearsal of their number in Bob's show, ""On a Sunday Afternoon,"" a Gay Nineties-type number. Just as Gordon gives in to Lillian's demands to star, Irene shows up at his office as LaBelle Arlette; Bob doesn't recognize her again. He quickly signs her for his show. When that news makes the newspapers, Keeler wonders how it could possibly be true since there is no real Arlette. Next during a rehearsal for Bob's show, LaBelle/Irene dances to a jazzy piano rendition of ""You Are My Lucky Star,"" but, when that doesnt work out well, she taps exquisitely without any accompaniment. A complication arises when the real Arlette wires the World Tribune threatening to sue if they continue writing about her, which causes Keeler to call a meeting with the fake Arlette in his office. By the end of the meeting they have a plan. Bob is throwing a banquet for Arlette that evening. Irene, not Arlette, shows up with Keeler. During the evening's floor show, Frances Langford, in a glittery tux outfit, sings ""Broadway Rhythm."" Once Miss Langford's solo ends, Ted and Sally dance, then, lots of black or white clad dancers flood the stage. Basil, Bob's assistant, and Lillian ballroom dance until Irene, in silver tails and sequined top hat, enters to tap to a duo piano accompaniment. It turns into a big, impressive number with a flashy ending. As the film ends, Keeler calls his story into the newspaper; the snoring man appears one last time, and Bob and Irene kiss.

He then kills Anton to assume his identity and the Baronship again. He is free to pursue Thea with Col.Hassel's blessing. When Col.Hassel discovers Gregor's impersonation, he also meets death. With Thea's true love, Lt. Lussan, wrongfully convicted of Hassel's murder, it appears nothing can stop evil Gregor from ambushing her into marriage.

                    When Baron Frederick de Berghman learns that his wife has given birth to twin boys, he refuses to drink a toast to them. He tells his courtiers that there is a prophecy that the younger of the twins - in this case born one minute after the elder - will kill his older brother in the Black Room. As a protective measure, he seals off the room in the hope that the prophecy may not happen. Many years later, Baron Gregor de Berghman pleads with his twin brother Anton to return to the family castle. Anton arrives to find the populace in revolt and there is even an attempt on his life when they mistake him for the Baron. There is no doubt that the Baron is evil and eventually kills Anton in the Black Room and takes his identity. That does no mean the prophecy cannot, or will not, come true.

                    This film is a remake of 1931's ""Galloping Thru"" which was directed by Lloyd Nolser and supervised by Paul Malvern from an original by Wellyn Totman. ""The Dawn Trail"", produced by Malvern,now gives the original film's director, Nosler, the story credit instead of Totman and rightly giving Nosler a more-correct screenplay credit.And, in 1938, Malvern makes the film again---""Western Trails"" with Bob Baker--- and this time Norton S. Parker is given the story credit. Bottom line is Trem Carr and Paul Malvern bought it from Totman in 1931 and gave the Story credit to whoever wrote the screenplay on the two remakes, and writer Wellyn Totman loses two credits rightfully belonging to him. The 1938 remake subs the name ""Bob Mason"" for ""John Mason""(in ""The Dawn Trail"") and all of the other main character names in ""Western Trails"" stayed the same. Check it out. The story has John Mason, after several seasons of punching cattle in Texas, coming back home to see his father,agent for the local freight line. He is not, as some summaries show, coming to town to avenge his father's death...his father ain't dead when he hits the city limits. On his way over to see his father, John bumps into Ben McClure, they have a fight, and Ben, a good-hearted fellow, decides the drinks are on him and he and John become fast friends in no time at all. John then decides to amble over to the freight office and call on his father, Dan Mason, and arrives in the midst of a hold-up and the elder Mason is killed. John pursues the robbers and is shot from his horse. Badly wounded, he is taken to his new best-friend's cabin, and is nursed back to health by Ben's sweetheart (although she doesn't know this), Alice Gordon and, as Totman's original story and Nosler's swipe would have it, John and Alice fall in love, especially after she saves his life from a gang headed by her brother, Rudd, who held up the freight station and killed Mason's father. None of which John knows. Recovered, he suspects Ben, who is already miffed because John has stolen his sweetheart, even if neither John nor Alice are aware of Ben's claim. Rudd challenges John to a duel in the street and Ben, plied with liquor supplied by Rudd and the gang member saloon owner, goes off and removes the cartridges from John's gun. John picks up his gun and heads for town. John is out in the street, with an empty gun, about to face Rudd, whose gun isn't empty. All three versions of Totman's original story---no matter who was given the remake credit---are among the best (a relative term) of the B-Western genre. Well, in the case of ""The Dawn Rider"", the reference is to the original B&W Lone Star version, and not to the awful colorized video version that, for some unknown reason, has dubbed voices and a completely unneeded---not to mention bad---musical track added. Make sure and get the original B&W Lone Star version.

                    Roderick Raskolnikov, a brilliant criminology student and writer, becomes embittered by poverty and his inability to support his family. When he sees a desperate prostitute, Sonya, degraded by a vicious pawnbroker, Raskolnikov, a proponent of the idea that some people are imbued with such intelligence that the law cannot be applied to them as to other people, decides to rid the world of the pawnbroker and thus save his family and Sonya as well from the fate poverty forces on them. When Porphiry, the police detective investigating the murder, encounters Raskolnikov, he finds a man nearly crippled by the guilt and paranoia his deed has burdened him with. But Raskolnikov clings with as much coldness and calculation as he can muster to his guiding idea, that some crimes ought not to be punished.

                    1908. Married couple Egbert and Effie Floud are among the nouveau riche in the small but booming town of Red Gap, Washington. Egbert is a self-made millionaire in local resources and ranching, while Effie comes about her money through her mother, 'Ma' Pettingill, who struck oil. Egbert is a good old boy who likes to hang out and drink with his equally down home friends - rich or poor - which is much like Ma, while Effie, who wears the pants in the family, wants to be seen as socially and financially important, with all the trappings. The Flouds live in Ma's mansion, with Effie's equally snobbish sister and brother-in-law, Mr. & Mrs. Charles Bellknap-Jackson, who flaunt their wealth and self-importance. While vacationing in Paris, the Flouds meet British Lord, the Earl of Burnstead, and his manservant, Ruggles, who comes from a long line of gentlemen's gentlemen. In a drunken stupor, the Flouds ""win"" Ruggles in a poker game against the Earl. By the sober light of the next day, Egbert has no intention of collecting on the bet, while Effie has every intention of doing so, seeing the addition of Ruggles to their Red Gap lives, specifically as Egbert's manservant, as elevating their social standing. Egbert sees the addition of Ruggles to their lives solely as another drinking buddy with who to hang out. Beyond Ruggles being a fish out of water in Red Gap, he faces the struggle of whether Egbert or Effie is his ultimate master. Complications ensue when before Effie can make the official social announcement of Ruggles being Egbert's new manservant, the newspaper reports that he is actually the Floud's important house guest, British Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles, this misunderstanding based partly on Egbert referring to him in public colloquially and in friendship as colonel. Regardless, Ruggles may get a different perspective on life residing in the frontier of the proverbial land of the free.

Ruggles accompanies his new employers to the tiny, wild town of Red Gap, Washington. Rich, rowdy Egbert Floud introduces Ruggles as ""Colonel"" Ruggles, and the town ladies are quite taken by the sophisticated servant in disguise as he enamors them with fictitious stories of battles gone by. Ruggles proves his newfound patriotism in one of the best scenes of the film, his recitation of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in the Silver Dollar Saloon. The dream of freedom leads him to open his own restaurant, where one of his first customers is the nobleman who has come to reclaim his former servant.

The many suspects include Roger Classon and his wife, Jerry, who are looking for Alice to testify and save Roger's friend from the electric chair for a murder he didn't commit; Abe Ohlman, the producer of Mary's show; and gangster Jimmy Kinland who seems to know more than he's telling. It's up to Clay, with the help of Donna, to trap the murderer and find Alice.

                    Small town girl Jane Bradford falls for Nick, a guy from the big city who offers her the opportunity to get away from her small town life. He also offers her ""headache powder"", she not knowing that it's cocaine and that Nick is a drug pusher. By the time they get to the city, she's hooked on her new medicine. Jane's brother, Eddie, goes to the city to look for his sister, who has not kept in touch with her family. Eddie gets a job as a carhop at a drive-in and is befriended by a drive-in's waitress named Fanny. Fanny is one of Nick's customers, and Fanny soon gets Eddie hooked on the headache powder. Due to this vice, Eddie and Fanny's life soon goes downhill. They're both fired from their jobs and are unable to find other work in their drugged out state. On the periphery of both Eddie and Jane's life is Dorothy Farley, a customer at the drive-in. Dorothy, dating Dan, comes from a wealthy family and she throws her money around easily. She's willing to assist financially those in need. She becomes the one in need when she's kidnapped by one of Nick's associates, who wants her to become another of Nick's steady customers. Jane, now known as Lil (she doesn't want her new life to sully her family's name), comes to Eddie's aid, trying to get him away from the city and back home. Jane also comes to Dorothy's aid, for a price, not before Dorothy learns the truth of Dan's identity and from where her family money comes.

Jane, a good girl, is smitten by the handsome and debonair Nick, who gives her a ""headache powder"" to snort to take her pounding headache away. Nick convinces her to go with him to the city, where they will be married. Jane leaves her mother and goes off to the city with Nick, where she discovers that he is really a drug dealer and that the ""medicine"" she has been taking is really cocaine. Jane becomes Nick's moll, but Nick becomes interested in a pretty blonde they see at a drive-in. The blonde has a crush on a guy who works at the drive-in, Eddie Bradford, Jane's brother, who has come to the city to look for her. Eddie's co-worker, Fanny, introduces him to cocaine; again under the pre-text that it is a ""headache medicine."" Eddie is hooked. The boss fires both of them, and they end up sharing a filthy skid-row apartment. Eddie can't get a job, he's too messed up on smack, so Fanny goes out and sells her virtues in order to get money for drugs. One night, she is passing a sleazy dive, the Dead Rat, when she is spotted by one of the customers, the blonde. She gives Fanny some money. Fanny returns to the apartment and gives him the money. He rushes off to an opium den, leaving her alone in the apartment. Meanwhile, Nick and his henchmen plot to kidnap the blond girl, who is the daughter of Mr. Farley, the district attorney. After an interminable floorshow, a ruckus is created and Nick's goons snatch the girl, taking her to Nick's apartment. Jane meets up with Eddie at the opium den, telling him that, while it's too late for her, he can still get rehabilitated, since he's only in the beginning stages of the addiction. Eddie goes back to the apartment he shares with Fanny, only to find that she has asphyxiated herself. He runs away. Jane goes to her apartment to find the girl prisoner there. The girl offers her a thousand dollars if she will help her escape. Jane calls the police. Nick returns home, and Jane shoots him. The police arrive and the girl's father is revealed to be the head of the narcotic racket.

Her life changes when she is chosen from among all the orphans to act as an usherette at a movie theater. At the theater, she meets Detlaff, a hotel waiter, who, seeing a naive young woman who would be easily led astray, decides to be Luisa's protector. Detlaff invites Luisa to the hotel to attend an upscale party at which he is working. There, Luisa attracts the attention of wealthy Konrad, who is instantly attracted to the naive Luisa despite Detlaff doing whatever he can to get Luisa away from who he sees as an unscrupulous man. Konrad wants to shower her with gifts and marry her. As she is apt to do when she is trying to dissuade a potential unwanted suitor, Luisa tells Konrad that she is already married. Seeing this as merely a slight obstacle, Konrad decides instead to employ Luisa's husband to make him rich so that he in turn can shower Luisa with gifts. Luisa sees this as an opportunity, not for herself, but some poor man in need. She sees herself as this yet unknown man's good fairy. Randomly from the telephone book, she chooses Dr. Max Sporum, a poor lawyer, to be her husband. Before Luisa can meet Sporum herself, Konrad meets with and eventually employs Sporum, who has no idea why he has been chosen as the lucky one to reap the benefits of this new lucrative contract. The only thing left is for Luisa to meet her imaginary husband and see how her good fairy act has changed his life.

Charlie's undercover agent, an Apache dancer, is murdered before she can disclose what she's learned.

Bill Gordon, a newspaperman in his civilian life, is dismayed to learn that at the last minute, instead of being shipped to fight in Europe as he wants, he is reassigned to a desk job doing decoding work under Major William Brennan. He eventually finds out this reassignment was orchestrated by a young woman he just met and is attracted to named Joel Carter - she who used information learned directly from him that he is a coding and decoding expert, and who is the niece of John Carter, the Assistant Secretary of War - so that they can spend time together. Bill negotiates with Carter and Brennan that once he completes his assigned task - to break a code that the Germans are currently using - that he will get his wish to fight in France. He is eventually able to break the code, but in the process learns that the Germans have in turn broken the code developed by Brennan to communicate with their battleships sailing in the North Atlantic to Europe, most specifically to relay rendezvous points. This causes a problem as they are damned if they do and damned if they don't send the coded rendezvous point message to a ship already in the North Atlantic. They have three days to uncover the German spy ring and get a rendezvous point message to their first ship making the crossing. They are quick to discover that Brennan's mistress, Olivia Karloff, is part of that spy ring. As such, Bill and Olivia enter into a game of cat and mouse, it never too clear who is the cat and who is the mouse. This game is made all the more complicated by a jealous Joel, who only sees in Olivia a beautiful woman with who Bill is spending much time.

Elderly and wealthy Mr. Lloyd is able to convince his fellow captains of industry to finance the proposal of engineer Richard ""Mac"" McAllan: a transatlantic tunnel between England and the United States. Mac not only has the technological expertise to accomplish the project in his vision, but believes the tunnel would benefit the world in so many different ways, including ensuring world peace. Standing by Mac in what is anticipated as a several decades long project is his best friend and fellow engineer, Frederick ""Robbie"" Robbins. Mac needs to spend as much time in the tunnel on the construction and engineering aspects as he does above ground placating the investors and assuring the public that things below ground are going smoothly. They run into a few issues underground, some so severe that could destroy the entire project and the lives of the construction crew. But there are also some above ground who are working for their own self-interest, often at the expense of the project as a whole. In addition, Mac's time away negatively affects his marriage to Ruth, who doesn't feel that Mac is there for her and for their infant son Geoffrey. Their marriage may not survive not only this issue, but an issue faced solely by Ruth, and some manoeuvrings by someone who has a vested interested in not seeing Mac and Ruth together.

                    Young idealist Richard Miller is selected as valedictorian for his New England high school commencement class of 1906 and intends to inject modern anti-capitalistic ideas into his speech. His father, Nat Miller, accidentally learns of it and interrupts Richard's speech before he can make a fool of himself. The small town later celebrates the Fourth of July with customary fireworks, picnics and the like, with Richard spending time with his girl, Muriel McComber, who promises she will allow him to kiss her one day. When Richard sends poems of love to Muriel, quoting the likes of Omar Khayyám and Swinburne, her father prevents her from ever seeing him again and forces her to write a letter denouncing him. Heartbroken, Richard drowns his sorrow in a local bar, drinking and smoking with a vamp called Belle, and comes home drunk. Alcoholic uncle Sid, who is used to the effects of liquor, nurses Richard back to sobriety, but Richard still must face the uncertain punishment of his father as he worries about his future with Muriel.

                    It's the summer of 1906 in New England. The Miller family consists of father Nat, the practical owner of the local newspaper, loving but always worried mother Essie, and their four children, Yale student Arthur who is home for the summer, just graduated from high school and class valedictorian Richard who is also heading to Yale in the fall, and precocious teenagers Tommy and Mildred. They lead a generally trouble-free life. The largest problem they have concerns Essie's brother, Sid, who lives with them. His constant drinking has caused many problems in him being able to lead a productive life, and to marry the woman he has always loved, Nat's sister Lily, who also lives with them and who won't marry him unless he stops imbibing. He has just taken a job in Waterbury to prove himself capable without this family support, as he has always worked for Nat as a reporter. One area of growing concern is idealistic Richard, who has of late started espousing the beliefs of many who are considered anarchists. He believes he can fix all the problems of the world through such ideas. He loves Muriel, the daughter of the Miller's narrow minded next door neighbor, Mr. McComber. In Richard's eyes, Muriel is always afraid of rocking the boat, which is why Mr. McComber disapproves of Richard, who he sees as trying to corrupt his impressionable daughter. What happens to Sid and Richard independently at the July 4th celebrations ultimately affects Sid's personal future with Lily, and Richard's view of the world and his life as he becomes a man.

Ricardi is thrust into high society and must do everything he once nagged Dan to do in order to bring the unruly brats under control. This is even more difficult than it seems as Carol defies him at every turn, and his old gang is trying to get him back in the business.

                    In World War I, British-officer Michael Andrews is captured by a band of Kurdish raiders on the Eastern Front, and is rescued by a man calling himself John Stevenson, although he refuses to tell his name to Andrews. The two men form a strange friendship, and help save an entire Kurdish village from a massacre and also avert a surprise attack on the British army-unit stationed there. Andrews suffers a wounded leg and is sent to the British military-hospital in Cairo. He falls in love with a nurse, Rosemary Haydon, and she with him, but she is married although she has not seen nor heard from her husband in over three years. It is at this point that the man who saved Andrews' life turns up to claim his wife, who is Rosemary. The latter bids adieu to Andrews who does not know that the man he considers his best friend is also the husband of the woman he loves. But, by pure coincidence and chance, both Andrews and Rosemary's husband come face-to-face again in a remote garrison that is under an attack that appears to have the possibility of no survivors among the fort defenders.

                    James Houghland, inventor of a new method by which television signals can be instantaneously sent anywhere in the world, refuses to sell the process to television companies, who then send agents to acquire the invention any way they can. On the night of his initial broadcast Houghland is mysteriously murdered in the middle of his demonstration and it falls to Police Chief Nelson to determine who the murderer is from the many suspects present.

                    Professor James Houghland, after years of research, has perfected revolutionary improvements in television, but he refuses all offers from companies that want to buy his inventions, and several unscrupulous promoters plan to get them by other means. On the night of the first public demonstration of his inventions, several well-known television experts are at Houghland's home. The first broadcast is an unqualified success. As the second broadcast is about to begin Houghland falls dead, and the police headed by Chief Nelson arrive, and no one is permitted to leave the house. Several of the guests are suspected: Arthur Perry, Hougland's assistant, because he was out of the room when the lights were turned on after the murder; Donald Jordan, because he tried to bribe Perry to steal the secret; Richard Grayson, an ambitious, young television engineer, because he had promised to secure the secret for his company, and Dr. Henry Scofield, because he refuses to explain a mysterious telephone call that he made shortly before the murder.
