In between, the film depicts the early adulthood of Moses as a beloved foster son of Pharaoh Seti I (brother of Bithiah) and general of his armies, his romance with Throne Princess Nefertari (or Nefretiri, as she is called in the film) and rivalry with the Pharaoh's own son, Prince Rameses II.Shortly after Moses' birth, Rameses I had ordered the slaying of all firstborn male Hebrews to prevent the prophecy of the Deliverer from coming true. Moses' mother (called ""Yoshebel"" in the film) had set him adrift on the Nile to escape, with his sister Miriam watching from a hidden spot. Bithiah discovers the Ark while playing with other young women in the banks of the Nile. She orders them to leave, then shows her servant Memnet the baby. Memnet warned Bithiah that the swaddling cloth was Levite, so the baby was placed there to escape Bithiah's father's edict. But Bithiah declared that this baby would be her son, and remembered when the pyramids were dust, and named ""Moses"" because she had drawn him from the Nile (the Hebrew name ""Moshe"" derived from the Hebrew word ""Mashu"", meaning ""to draw""). Despite Memnet's protests about serving a son of Hebrew slaves, Bithiah ordered her to serve him and to swear to secrecy on pain of death. But Memnet hides the cloth under her clothes.As a young general, Moses is victorious in a war with the Nubian people of ancient Ethiopia, loosing captured ibises to combat the serpents (as recorded by Josephus) and further impresses Seti I by being wily enough to enter into an alliance with the conquered Ethiopians rather than subjugate them. Moses then is charged with building a treasure city for Seti's Jubilee, that Rameses failed to complete (probably the Biblical treasure cities of Pithom and Ramases (Avaris)).Meanwhile, Moses and Nefretiri are deeply in love; she is the ""throne princess"", who must marry the next Pharaoh. Rameses wants her for himself, not because of any liking for her but for the throne, but Nefretiri hates him.When Moses assumes control of the project, he rescued an old grease-woman from being left to be crushed; unknown to him it was his birthmother Yoshebel. Moses tells the Egyptian Master Builder Baka, ""blood makes poor mortar"" and asks ""are you a master builder or a master butcher?"" And he frees Joshua the stonecutter who had struck an Egyptian, punishable by death, to try to save Yoshebel whom Joshua didn't know. Moses was impressed with Joshua's bravery and words, and institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slave workers such as one day in seven to rest and even going so far as to raid temple granaries for necessary food supplies. Moses questions Joshua about his God, and Joshua declares his strong faith but says that God's name is unknown.Rameses uses these changes as proof that Moses is planning an insurrection by currying the slaves' favor, and points out that the slaves are calling Moses the ""Deliverer"" of prophecy. However, when Seti confronts Moses, Moses argues he is simply making his workers more productive by making them stronger and happier. He proves his point with such impressive progress on the project that Seti becomes convinced that Rameses falsely accused his foster brother. Seti promises that Moses will get credit for the new city. Rameses, meanwhile, has been charged by his father with the task of finding out if there really is a Hebrew fitting the description of the Deliverer, and is having no luck.As Nefretiri is joyously preparing for marriage, Memnet informs her that Prince Moses is not a prince at all, but the son of Hebrew slaves. Nefretiri is furious at the accusation, whereupon Memnet produces the Levite cloth and tells Nefretiri to wrap their firstborn in it. Memnet also tells her that a little girl had led her to Yochebel to breastfeed Moses, which she realized must be the real mother. Nefretiri kills Memnet by pushing her over the balcony.Moses learns of this, so asks Bithiah, who dissembles and reminds him of how he never doubted her when he held his hand as he took his first step. When Moses leaves, promising that no matter what he found, he would always love her. She rushes in a chariot to Yoshebel. Bithiah pleads with her not to reveal anything, since she has put the throne of Egypt within his grasp, and also declares how much she loved and cared for him, and promised to free them and make sure they were well cared for. But Moses had followed from a distance, and Yoshebel could not look him in the eyes and deny that she was his mother. And her robe matched the pattern of the much more faded Levite cloth Memnet kept. Then Yoshebel's adult children introduce themselves to Moses as, ""I am your brother, Aaron,"" and ""I am Miriam, your sister."" Bithiah sadly departs.Declaring he is not ashamed (""Egyptian or Hebrew, I'm still Moses""), but curious, he spends time working among the slaves to learn of their hardship, only to be rescued from the mudpits by Nefretiri. Moses then saves Joshua, a Hebrew stonecutter, from being whipped death at the hands of Baka; he kills Baka who was about to whip Joshua to death. Dathan, the devious and ambitious Hebrew overseer who's been charged by Rameses to help him find the Deliverer, watches from hiding. Moses confesses to Joshua that he himself is Hebrew; Joshua excitedly proclaims Moses the Deliverer, and although Moses denies it, Dathan has all the proof he needs. Revealing what he knows to Rameses, Dathan bargains for Baka's house, a post as Governor of Goshen and the ownership of Joshua's betrothed Lilia.Moses is arrested and brought in chains before Seti, who begs him to say he is not the Deliverer. Moses does so, but avows that he would free the slaves if he could. Bithiah confesses to her brother Seti that she took Moses from the Nile knowing by the design on his blankets that he was Hebrew. In a short, impassioned speech, Moses says that it is evil to enslave or oppress people, ""to be stripped of spirit, and hope and faith, all because they are of another race, another creed. If there is a God, He did not mean this to be so!"" Seti is grievously hurt, since he said that he had always loved him as a son, more than his own real son Rameses. So Seti imprisons him and orders his name stricken from all records and monuments, to be unspoken in Egypt forever thereafter. Rameses banishes Moses to the desert, fearing to execute him lest he create a martyr. Meanwhile, Seti proclaims Rameses to be the next Pharoah. Nefretiri as the Throne Princess is required to marry the arrogant prince, to her great distress.Moses makes his way across the desert, nearly dying of hunger and thirst. He comes to a well in the land of Midian. After drinking and eating dates from a nearby palm tree he passes out, to be awakened by the sound of seven sisters watering their flocks. Bullying Amalekites appear, pushing the girls aside, whereupon Moses wakes. Seemingly appearing out of nowhere he thrashes the Amalekites soundly with his staff, forcing them to wait their turn at the well. Moses finds a home in Midian with the girls' father Jethro, a Bedouin sheik, who reveals that he is a follower of ""He who has no name"", which Moses recognized as the God of Abraham. Jethro explains that they are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's first-born. Moses later impresses Jethro and the other shieks with his wise and just trading, so Jethro offers Moses one of his daughters as a wife. Moses chooses the eldest daughter, called Sephora in the film (the Greek form of her name), the least flamboyant but wisest, who was previously the one who had stood up to the Amalekites.Back in Egypt, Seti dies heartbroken, with Moses' name on his lips, and Rameses succeeds him as Pharaoh (becoming Rameses II), taking Nefretiri as his Queen. Herding sheep in the desert, Moses finds Joshua, who has escaped from hard labour in the copper mines. Moses sees the Burning Bush on the summit of Mount Sinai; climbing up to investigate, he hears the voice of God. Naming himself ""I Am That I Am"", God charges Moses to return to Egypt and free His chosen people.At Pharaoh's court, Moses comes before Rameses to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a snake to show Rameses the power of God. Jannes and another magician do the same, but Moses's snake eats the others (not shown; the small son of Rameses and Nefretiri tells his mother with alarm). But the Pharaoh decrees that the Hebrews be given no straw to make their bricks, but to make the same tally as before on pain of death. As the Hebrews prepare to stone Moses in anger, Nefretiri's retinue rescues him; but when she attempts to resume their relationship, he spurns her, reminding her that not only is he on a mission, having been touched by God, but that he is also married.As Moses continues to challenge Pharaoh's hold over his people, Egypt is beset by divine plagues. We see the water turned into blood, and hear of others. But Rameses hears of a naturalistic explanation of a mountain beyond the Nile cataract spewing red mud, although this would not have explained what the film showed: the red colour starting from where Aaron's stick touched the river and moving away, or the water in pitchers turning red as it was poured. but given this explanation, Rameses declared it not surprising that fish would die and frogs leave the water, and flies would bloat upon their carcasses and spread disease. So Moses predicts hot hail and three days of darkness; the hot hail comes shortly after and bursts into flame on the ground. Moses warns that the next plague would come from his own lips.Enraged at the plagues and Moses' continuous demands, and at his generals and advisers telling him to give in. Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but just as Moses had foretold, this intention backfires. Although Nefretiri warns Sephora to escape with Gershom on a passing caravan to Midian, Moses tells her sadly that it is her own son who will die, and he cannot save him. In an eerily quiet scene, the Angel of Death creeps into Egyptian streets in a glowing green cloud, killing all the firstborn of Egypt, including the adult son of Pharaoh's top general, and Pharaoh's own child. Meanwhile, Bithiah is released to Moses.Broken and despondent, Pharaoh orders Moses to take ""your people, your cattle, your God and your pestilence"" and go. Dathan is also ordered out when the Egyptian guards sees the sacrifice lamb's blood on the sides of his door frame, his position as an overseer counting for nothing with the Egyptians, the Hebrews resentful of him and refusing him the privileges he expects. The Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt begins. Behold His mighty hand!Goaded into rage by Nefretiri in her grief and anger at Moses, the Pharaoh arms himself and gathers his armies to chase the former slaves to the shore of the Red Sea. Held back by a pillar of fire, the Egyptian forces can only watch as Moses parts the waters (""Behold His mighty hand!"") to provide his people an escape route. As the Hebrews race over the seabed, the pillar of fire dies down and the army rides in hot pursuit. The Hebrews make it to the far shore just in time to witness God's closing of the waters on the Egyptian army, drowning every man and horse. Rameses looks on in despair. All he can do is return to Nefretiri, confessing to her, ""His god is God.""The former slaves camp at the foot of Sinai and wait as Moses again ascends the mountain. When Moses delays coming down from Sinai, the Hebrews lose faith and, urged on by the evil Dathan, build a golden calf as an idol to bear before them back to Egypt, hoping to win Rameses' forgiveness. Aaron is forced to help fashion the gold plating. He also orders Lilia to be sacrificed. The people proceed to indulge their most wanton desires in an orgy of sinfulness. Sephora, now re-united with Moses, tells the people that he has gone to receive God's Law, and Bithiah asks, ""Would the God who's shown you such wonders let Moses die before his work his done?"" But their defences are mostly disregarded after Dathan's demagoguery.Meanwhile, high atop the mountain, Moses witnesses God's creation of the stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments. When he finally climbs down, Moses beholds his people's iniquity and hurls the tablets at the idol in a rage. The idol explodes, and Dathan and his followers (such as Korah) are killed, a burning crevasse swallows all who do not join Moses at his side. After God forces them to endure forty years' exile in the desert wandering lost to prove their loyalty, the Hebrews finally are on the eve of arriving in the land of Israel. An elderly Moses then appoints Joshua to succeed him as leader (with Lilia by Joshua's side), says a final good bye to his devoted wife Sephora, and goes forth out of Israel to his destiny.","

United Planet cruiser C57D is a year out from Earth base on the way to Altair for a special mission. Commander J.J Adams (Leslie Neilsen) orders the crew to the deceleration booths as the ship drops from light speed to normal space.Adams orders pilot Jerry Farman (Jack Kelly) to lay in a course for the fourth planet. The captain then briefs the crew that they are at their destination, and that they are to look for survivors from the Bellerophon expedition 20 years earlier.As they orbit the planet looking for signs of life, the ship is scanned by a radar facility some 20 square miles in area. Morbius (Walter Pigeon) contacts the ship from the planet asking why the ship is here. Morbius goes on to explain he requires nothing, no rescue is required and he can't guarantee the safety of the ship or its crew.Adams confirms that Morbius was a member of the original crew, but is puzzled at the cryptic warning Morbius realizes the ship is going to land regardless, and gives the pilot coordinates in a desert region of the planet. The ship lands and security details deploy. Within minutes a high speed dust cloud approaches the ship. Adams realizes it is a vehicle, and as it arrives the driver is discovered to be a robot (Robby). Robby welcomes the crew to Altair 4 and invites members of the crew to Morbius' residence.Adams, Farman and Doc Ostrow (Warren Stevens) arrive at the residence and are greeted by Morbius. They sit down to a meal prepared by Robby's food synthesizer and Morbius shows the visitors Robby's other abilities, including his unwavering obedience. Morbius then gives Robby a blaster with orders to shoot Adams. Robby refuses and goes into a mechanical mind lock, disabling him until the order is changed.Morbius then shows the men the defense system of the house (A series of steel shutters). When questioned, Morbius admits that the Belleraphon crew is dead, Morbius and his wife being the only original survivors. Morbius's wife has also died, but months after the others and from natural causes. Morbius goes on to explain many of the crew were torn limb from limb by a strange creature or force living on the planet. The Belleraphon herself was destroyed when the final three surviving members tried to take off for Earth.Adams wonders why this force has remained dormant all these years and never attacked Morbius. As discussions continue, a young woman Altaira (Anne Francis) introduces herself as Morbius daughter. Farman takes an immediate interest in Altaira, and begins to flirt with her.Altaira then shows the men her ability to control wild animals by petting a wild tiger. During this display the ship checks in on the safety of the away party. Adams explains he will need to check in with Earth for further orders and begins preparations for sending a signal. Because of the power needed the ship will be disabled for up to 10 days. Morbius is mortified by this extended period and offers Robby's services in building the communication facilityThe next day Robby arrives at ship as the crew unloads the engine to power the transmitter. To lighten the tense moment the commander instructs the crane driver to pick up Cookie (Earl Holliman) and move him out of the way. Quinn interrupts the practical joke to report that the assembly is complete and they can transmit in the morning.Meanwhile Cookie goes looking for Robby and organizes for the robot to synthesize some bourbon. Robby takes a sample and tells Cookie he can have 60 gallons ready the next morning for him.Farman continues to court Altair by teaching her how to kiss, and the health benefits of kissing. Adams interrupts the exercise, and is clearly annoyed with a mix of jealous. He then explains to Altair that the clothes she wears are inappropriate around his crew. Altair tries to argue till Adams looses patience and order Altair to leave the area.That night, Altair, still furious, explains to her father what occurred. Altair takes Adams advice to heart and orders Robby to run up a less revealing dress. Meanwhile back at the ship two security guards think they hear breathing in the darkness but see nothing.Inside the ship, one of the crew half asleep sees the inner hatch opened and some material moved around. Next morning the Captain holds court on the events of the night before. Quinn advises the captain that most of the missing and damaged equipment can be replaced except for the Clystron monitor. Angry, the Capt. and Doc go back to Morbius to confront him about what has occurred.Morbius is unavailable, so the two men settle in to wait. Outside Adams sees Altair swimming and goes to speak to her. Thinking she is naked, Adams becomes flustered and unsettled till he realizes she wants him to see her new dress. Altair asks why Adams wont kiss her like everyone else has. He gives in and plants one on her. Behind them a tiger emerges from the forest and attacks Altair, Adams reacts by shooting it. Altair is badly troubled by the incident; the tiger had been her friend, but she can't understand why it acted as if she was an enemy.Returning to the house, Doc and Adams accidentally open Morbius' office. They find a series of strange drawings but no sign of Morbius. He appears through a secret door and is outraged at the intrusion. Adams explains the damage done to the ship the previous night and his concern that Morbius was behind the attack.Morbius admits it is time for explanations. He goes on to tell them about a race of creatures that lived on the planet called the Krell. In the past they had visited Earth, which explains why there are Earth animals on the planet. Morbius believes the Krell civilization collapsed in a single night, right on the verge of their greatest discovery. Today 2000 centuries later, nothing of their cities exists above ground.Morbius then takes them on a tour of the Krell underground installation. Morbius first shows them a device for projecting their knowledge; he explains how he began to piece together information. Then an education device that projects images formed in the mind. Finally he explains what the Krell were expected to do, and how much lower human intelligence is in comparison.Doc tries the intelligence tester but is confused when it does not register as high as Morbius. Morbius then explains it can also boost intelligence, and that the captain of the Belleraphon died using it. Morbius himself was badly injured but when he recovered his IQ had doubled.Adams questions why all the equipment looks brand new. It is explained that all the machines left on the planet are self repairing and Morbius takes them on a tour of the rest of the installation. First they inspect a giant air vent that leads to the core of the planet. There are 400 other such shafts in the area and 9200 thermal reactors spread through the facilities 8000 cubic miles.Later that night the crew has completed the security arrangements and tests the force field fence. Cookie asks permission to go outside the fence. He meets Robby, who gives him the 60 gallons of bourbon.Outside, something hits the fence and shorts it out. The security team checks the breach but finds nothing. A series of foot-like depressions begin forming leading to the ship. Something unseen enters the ship. A scream echos through the compound.Back at the Morbius residence he argues that only he should be allowed to control the flow of Krell technology back to Earth. In the middle of the discussion, Adams is paged and told that the Chief Quinn has been murdered. Adams breaks off his discussions and heads back to the ship.Later that night Doc finds the footprints and makes a cast. The foot makes no evolutionary sense. It seems to have elements of a four footed and biped creature; also it seems to be both a predator and herbivore. Adams questions Cookie, who was with the robot during the test, and decides the robot was not responsible.The next day at the funeral for Chief, Morbius again warns him of impending doom facing the ship and crew. Adams considers this a challenge and spends the day fortifying the position around the ship. After testing the weapons and satisfied all that could be done has, the radar station suddenly reports movement in the distance moving slowly towards the ship.No one sees anything despite the weapons being under radar fire control. The controller confirms a direct hit, but the object is still moving towards the ship. Suddenly something hits the force field fence, and a huge monster appears outlined in the energy flux. The crew open fire, but seem to do little good. A number of men move forward but are quickly killed.Morbius wakes hearing the screams of Altair. She's had a dream mimicking the attack that has just occurred. As Morbius is waking the creature in the force field disappears. Doc theorizes that the creature is made of some sort of energy, renewing itself second by second.Adams takes Doc in the tractor to visit Morbius, intending to evacuate him from the planet. He leaves orders for the ship to be readied for liftoff. If he and Doc dont get back, the ship is to leave without them. They also want to try and break into Morbius' office and take the brain booster test.They are met at the door by Robby, who disarms them. Altair appears and countermands the orders given to Robby by her father. Seeing a chance, Doc sneaks into the office. Altair argues with Adams about trying to make Morbius return home; she ultimately declares her love for him.Robby appears carrying the injured Doc. Struggling to speak and in heavy pain, Doc explains that the Krell succeeded in their great experiment. However they forgot about the subconscious monsters they would release. Monsters from the id.Morbius sees the dead body of Doc, and makes a series of ugly comments. His daughter reminds him that Doc is dead. Morbius' lack of care convinces Altair she is better off going with Adams. Morbius tries to talk Adams out of taking Altair.Adams demands an explanation of the id. Morbius realizes he is the source of the creature killing everyone. The machine the Krell built was able to release his inner beast, the subconscious monster dwelling deep inside his ancestral mind.Robby interrupts the debate to report something approaching the house. Morbius triggers the defensive shields of the house, which the creature begins to destroy. Morbius then orders Robby to destroy the creature; however, Robby short circuits. Adams explained that it was useless; Robby knew it was Morbius himself.Adams, Altair and Morbius retreat to the Krell lab and seal themselves in by sealing a special indestructible door. Adams convinces Morbius that he is really the monster, and that Morbius cannot actually control his subconscious desires.The group watch as the creature beings the slow process of burning through the door. Panicked, Morbius implores Altair to say it is not so. Suddenly the full realization comes, and he understands that he could endanger or even kill Altair.As the creature breaks through, Morbius rushes forward and denies its existence. Suddenly the creature disappears but Morbius is mortally wounded. With his dying breath he instructs Adams to trigger a self destruct mechanism linked to the reactors of the great machine. The ship and crew have 24 hours to get as far away from the planet as possibleThe next day we see the ship deep in space. Robby and Altair are onboard watching as the planet brightens and is destroyed. Adams assures Altair that her father's memory will shine like a beacon.","
    
                    When Adams and his crew are sent to investigate the silence from a planet inhabited by scientists, he finds all but two have died. Dr. Morbius and his daughter Altaira have somehow survived a hideous monster which roams the planet. Unknown to Adams, Morbius has made a discovery, and has no intention of sharing it (or his daughter!) with anyone.

    Synopsis
    Opening sceneIt is late in the 22nd Century. United Planet cruiser C57D is a year out from Earth base on the way to Altair for a special mission. Commander J.J Adams (Leslie Neilsen) orders the crew to the deceleration booths as the ship drops from light speed to normal space.Adams orders pilot Jerry Farman (Jack Kelly) to lay in a course for the fourth planet. The captain then briefs the crew that they are at their destination, and that they are to look for survivors from the Bellerophon expedition 20 years earlier.As they orbit the planet looking for signs of life, the ship is scanned by a radar facility some 20 square miles in area. Morbius (Walter Pigeon) contacts the ship from the planet asking why the ship is here. Morbius goes on to explain he requires nothing, no rescue is required and he can't guarantee the safety of the ship or its crew.Adams confirms that Morbius was a member of the original crew, but is puzzled at the cryptic warning Morbius realizes the ship is going to land regardless, and gives the pilot coordinates in a desert region of the planet. The ship lands and security details deploy. Within minutes a high speed dust cloud approaches the ship. Adams realizes it is a vehicle, and as it arrives the driver is discovered to be a robot (Robby). Robby welcomes the crew to Altair 4 and invites members of the crew to Morbius' residence.Adams, Farman and Doc Ostrow (Warren Stevens) arrive at the residence and are greeted by Morbius. They sit down to a meal prepared by Robby's food synthesizer and Morbius shows the visitors Robby's other abilities, including his unwavering obedience. Morbius then gives Robby a blaster with orders to shoot Adams. Robby refuses and goes into a mechanical mind lock, disabling him until the order is changed.Morbius then shows the men the defense system of the house (A series of steel shutters). When questioned, Morbius admits that the Belleraphon crew is dead, Morbius and his wife being the only original survivors. Morbius's wife has also died, but months after the others and from natural causes. Morbius goes on to explain many of the crew were torn limb from limb by a strange creature or force living on the planet. The Belleraphon herself was destroyed when the final three surviving members tried to take off for Earth.Adams wonders why this force has remained dormant all these years and never attacked Morbius. As discussions continue, a young woman Altaira (Anne Francis) introduces herself as Morbius daughter. Farman takes an immediate interest in Altaira, and begins to flirt with her
.
Altaira then shows the men her ability to control wild animals by petting a wild tiger. During this display the ship checks in on the safety of the away party. Adams explains he will need to check in with Earth for further orders and begins preparations for sending a signal. Because of the power needed the ship will be disabled for up to 10 days. Morbius is mortified by this extended period and offers Robby's services in building the communication facilityThe next day Robby arrives at ship as the crew unloads the engine to power the transmitter. To lighten the tense moment the commander instructs the crane driver to pick up Cookie (Earl Holliman) and move him out of the way. Quinn interrupts the practical joke to report that the assembly is complete and they can transmit in the morning.Meanwhile Cookie goes looking for Robby and organizes for the robot to synthesize some bourbon. Robby takes a sample and tells Cookie he can have 60 gallons ready the next morning for him.Farman continues to court Altair by teaching her how to kiss, and the health benefits of kissing. Adams interrupts the exercise, and is clearly annoyed with a mix of jealous. He then explains to Altair that the clothes she wears are inappropriate around his crew. Altair tries to argue till Adams looses patience and order Altair to leave the area.That night, Altair, still furious, explains to her father what occurred. Altair takes Adams advice to heart and orders Robby to run up a less revealing dress. Meanwhile back at the ship two security guards think they hear breathing in the darkness but see nothing.Inside the ship, one of the crew half asleep sees the inner hatch opened and some material moved around. Next morning the Captain holds court on the events of the night before. Quinn advises the captain that most of the missing and damaged equipment can be replaced except for the Clystron monitor. Angry, the Capt. and Doc go back to Morbius to confront him about what has occurred.Morbius is unavailable, so the two men settle in to wait. Outside Adams sees Altair swimming and goes to speak to her. Thinking she is naked, Adams becomes flustered and unsettled till he realizes she wants him to see her new dress. Altair asks why Adams wont kiss her like everyone else has. He gives in and plants one on her. Behind them a tiger emerges from the forest and attacks Altair, Adams reacts by shooting it. Altair is badly troubled by the incident; the tiger had been her friend, but she can't understand why it acted as if she was an enemy.Returning to the house, Doc and Adams accidentally open Morbius' office.

There he tells a psychiatrist, Dr. Hill (Whit Bissell), and the attending physician, Dr. Bassett (Richard Deacon) his fantastic story.Several days earlier, Miles had been called home to Santa Mira from a medical convention. His nurse, Sally Withers (Jean Willes) told him that several patients had come in frantically insisting that their relatives and friends were not who they seemed to be. On the way to the office, Miles and Sally nearly ran over young Jimmy Grimaldi (Bobby Clark) who was fleeing from his mother (Eileen Stevens). Mrs. Grimaldi says Jimmy simply didn't want to go to school. Miles was sad to see that the Grimaldis had shut down their vegetable stand because it was too much work.Later, at his office, Miles learned that many of the patients begging for his return claimed they no longer needed his services. A former girlfriend, Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) stopped by. She told him that her cousin, Wilma (Virginia Christine), insisted that her father, Ira (Tom Fadden), wasn't who he seemed to be. Miles agreed to visit Wilma later. Miles and Becky chatted, revealing that they both had recently divorced. After lunch, Jimmy Grimaldi was brought to Miles's office by his grandmother. He insisted that his mother was not really his mother. Suspicious, Miles gave the boy a sedative and told his grandmother to keep the boy at her house that night.Miles and Becky visited Ira and Wilma. Miles admitted his examination of Ira led him to conclude that it was indeed Ira. Wilma insisted that although nothing physically or mentally seemed different about him, his emotional connection to her was wrong. Wilma agreed to see a psychiatrist to discuss her concerns. That night, Becky and Miles went to dinner and encountered the town psychiatrist, Dan Kauffman (Larry Gates), in the parking lot. He mentioned that he too had seen many perplexing cases of people claiming that loved ones had somehow changed.Before they could eat, Miles and Becky were called to the house of Jack and Teddy Belicec (King Donovan and Carolyn Jones). They had found an inert, featureless humanoid creature in their poolroom. Teddy was disturbed by it, and the creature seemed to be taking on Jack's features. It even bled from a hand as Jack did when he cut it on a piece of glass. Miles took Becky home to her father's house. Her father (Kenneth Patterson) seemed normal but Miles was disturbed by something. Returning to the Driscoll house later that night, he broke into the basement and found another humanoid transforming itself into Becky. He snuck upstairs and rescued Becky.Miles and Jack called Dan Kauffman to see the bodies at the Belicecs' and Driscolls'. Both were missing. Dan suggested that they found a real dead human in Jack's poolroom and that its cause of death had been too small for Miles to notice in his examination. He also suggested that Miles saw Becky's double because he had been so unsettled by the mysterious body at the Belicecs'. Becky's father had called the police when he heard Dan, Jack and Miles in his basement. When Police Chief Grivett (Ralph Dumke) arrived, he informed them that a burning body matching the description of what the Belicecs found had been discovered burning outside of town.In town the next day, Miles encountered Wilma who told him she felt better about Ira and didn't need to see Dan. Based on Miles's demeanor she realized he knew something, and told Becky's father, who was hiding in her antique store. At his office, Miles saw Jimmy smiling next to his mother in the waiting room, apparently unconcerned about her anymore. That night, Miles, Becky and the Belicecs planned to barbeque. But Miles found enormous seed pods in his greenhouse. The pods opened up and inert bodies fell out. They quickly began to take the form of Miles and his guests. Miles tried to call the FBI in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Washington D.C. but was told by the operator that the lines are dead. Miles destroyed the creatures, then he and Becky and the Belicecs split up, hoping to get out of town. Miles and Becky stopped for gas. When Miles went to a phone booth to try to reach the FBI again, the gas station attendant placed two pods in the trunk of his car. Miles realized this and destroyed the pods later. He drove to Sally's house. Sneaking up to a window, he saw that she too had been transformed into a pod person and coolly planned to place a seed pod in the crib of her newborn. Miles was discovered by another police officer. Miles and Becky escaped, pursued by the police and other pod people.Miles and Becky hid out in Miles's office. Realizing that the pods were most effective at replacing people when they were asleep, they took amphetamines to stay awake. The next morning, they saw police officers detain people just arriving to town, and watched as transformed citizens accepted pods to take to their relatives in nearby cities. Jack, Dan and Chief Grivett arrived. Miles and Becky were horrified to learn they'd all been transformed. Jack and Dan explained that the pods had arrived from outer space and that the transformation was painless. Soon everyone would be reborn into a better way of life, evolved beyond human emotions like hate and love. Jack and Dan brought pods into Miles's waiting room and locked Miles and Becky in the office. Miles filled three syringes with a sedative, then created a diversion that brought Dan and Jack back into the office. Miles struggled with them but drugged them, with Becky taking care of Grivett.Hoping to pretend to have been transformed by appearing emotionless, Becky and Miles made their way out of the office and into the street. But Becky saw a truck nearly hit a dog and called out in fear. Alerted, the pod people chased Becky and Miles into the hills around Santa Mira. They hid in an abandoned mine. Miles left Becky to try to find help. When he returned, he found Becky asleep. He tried to carry her to safety but learned when he kissed her that she had been transformed too. With other pod people in pursuit, Miles ran to the highway. He pleaded with motorists to stop but they considered him crazy. He saw a truck full of pods headed to Los Angeles. Miles wandered the highway, telling people that ""They're already here! You're next!""Drs. Hill and Basset consider Miles insane and plan his treatment. Then an ambulance brings in a truck driver who had been in an accident. His truck was full of unusual pods, and had been on the road from Santa Mira. Realizing Miles is telling the truth, Dr. Hill immediately calls the police and the FBI.","
    
                    Dr. Miles Bennell returns to his small town practice to find several of his patients suffering the paranoid delusion that their friends or relatives are impostors. He is initially skeptical, especially when the alleged dopplegängers are able to answer detailed questions about their victim's lives, but he is eventually persuaded that something odd has happened and determines to find out what is causing this phenomenon. This film can be seen as a paranoid 1950s warning against those Damn Commies or, conversely, as a metaphor for the tyranny of McCarthyism (or the totalitarian system of Your Choice) and has a pro- and epilogue that was forced upon Siegel by the studio to lighten the tone.

That night, Becky and Miles went to dinner and encountered the town psychiatrist, Dan Kauffman (Larry Gates), in the parking lot. He mentioned that he too had seen many perplexing cases of people claiming that loved ones had somehow changed.Before they could eat, Miles and Becky were called to the house of Jack and Teddy Belicec (King Donovan and Carolyn Jones). They had found an inert, featureless humanoid creature in their poolroom. Teddy was disturbed by it, and the creature seemed to be taking on Jack's features. It even bled from a hand as Jack did when he cut it on a piece of glass. Miles took Becky home to her father's house. Her father (Kenneth Patterson) seemed normal but Miles was disturbed by something. Returning to the Driscoll house later that night, he broke into the basement and found another humanoid transforming itself into Becky. He snuck upstairs and rescued Becky.Miles and Jack called Dan Kauffman to see the bodies at the Belicecs' and Driscolls'. Both were missing. Dan suggested that they found a real dead human in Jack's poolroom and that its cause of death had been too small for Miles to notice in his examination. He also suggested that Miles saw Becky's double because he had been so unsettled by the mysterious body at the Belicecs'. Becky's father had called the police when he heard Dan, Jack and Miles in his basement. When Police Chief Grivett (Ralph Dumke) arrived, he informed them that a burning body matching the description of what the Belicecs found had been discovered burning outside of town.In town the next day, Miles encountered Wilma who told him she felt better about Ira and didn't need to see Dan. Based on Miles's demeanor she realized he knew something, and told Becky's father, who was hiding in her antique store. At his office, Miles saw Jimmy smiling next to his mother in the waiting room, apparently unconcerned about her anymore. That night, Miles, Becky and the Belicecs planned to barbeque. But Miles found enormous seed pods in his greenhouse. The pods opened up and inert bodies fell out. They quickly began to take the form of Miles and his guests. Miles tried to call the FBI in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Washington D.C. but was told by the operator that the lines are dead. Miles destroyed the creatures, then he and Becky and the Belicecs split up, hoping to get out of town. Miles and Becky stopped for gas. When Miles went to a phone booth to try to reach the FBI again, the gas station attendant placed two pods in the trunk of his car. Miles realized this and destroyed the pods later. He drove to Sally's house. Sneaking up to a window, he saw that she too had been transformed into a pod person and coolly planned to place a seed pod in the crib of her newborn. Miles was discovered by another police officer. Miles and Becky escaped, pursued by the police and other pod people.Miles and Becky hid out in Miles's office. Realizing that the pods were most effective at replacing people when they were asleep, they took amphetamines to stay awake. The next morning, they saw police officers detain people just arriving to town, and watched as transformed citizens accepted pods to take to their relatives in nearby cities. Jack, Dan and Chief Grivett arrived. Miles and Becky were horrified to learn they'd all been transformed. Jack and Dan explained that the pods had arrived from outer space and that the transformation was painless. Soon everyone would be reborn into a better way of life, evolved beyond human emotions like hate and love. Jack and Dan brought pods into Miles's waiting room and locked Miles and Becky in the office. Miles filled three syringes with a sedative, then created a diversion that brought Dan and Jack back into the office. Miles struggled with them but drugged them, with Becky taking care of Grivett.Hoping to pretend to have been transformed by appearing emotionless, Becky and Miles made their way out of the office and into the street. But Becky saw a truck nearly hit a dog and called out in fear. Alerted, the pod people chased Becky and Miles into the hills around Santa Mira. They hid in an abandoned mine. Miles left Becky to try to find help. When he returned, he found Becky asleep. He tried to carry her to safety but learned when he kissed her that she had been transformed too. With other pod people in pursuit, Miles ran to the highway. He pleaded with motorists to stop but they considered him crazy. He saw a truck full of pods headed to Los Angeles. Miles wandered the highway, telling people that ""They're already here! You're next!""Drs. Hill and Basset consider Miles insane and plan his treatment. Then an ambulance brings in a truck driver who had been in an accident. His truck was full of unusual pods, and had been on the road from Santa Mira. Realizing Miles is telling the truth, Dr. Hill immediately calls the police and the FBI.

Aaron is a little wary of Ethan, who has not been seen since the surrender of the Confederate Army, but his children -- Lucy, Ben and Debbie -- are all overjoyed to see him. So is Martha (Dorothy Jordan), Aaron's wife; she and Ethan clearly are in love though they cannot act on it. Aaron and Martha's adopted quarter Cherokee son Martin arrives for dinner. He greets Ethan but Ethan is very unhappy in his presence despite the fact that he is the one who found him abandoned as an infant. Martin and everybody else can see Ethan's dislike for him. As the night draws in,Martin sits outside on the porch feeling distant from the family in Ethan's presence. He goes to off to bed as do the other kids, and Aaron and Martha soon discover that Ethan is in possession of newly minted Northern money. Aaron agrees to hide the money for Ethan and tells him he is free to stay as long as he likes. Ethan knows his welcome is tenuous, however, and after everyone else goes to bed, sits alone on the porch.The next morning, the Reverend Captain Samuel Clayton (Ward Bond), the area's minister and captain of the Texas Rangers, comes with a posse to the farm. Someone has run off Lars Jorgensen's (John Qualen) cattle. Clayton deputizes Aaron and Martin to join the Rangers' posse. Ethan tells Aaron he is not to go but instead to stay close to home in case the cattle rustling was in fact a diversionary ploy by aggressive Native Americans. Clayton is glad to see his former compatriot in the Confederate Army but also mentions that Ethan matches the description of a lot of wanted criminals. Ethan agrees to go with the Rangers to search for the cattle but refuses to swear an oath to the state of Texas, believing that his oath to the Confederacy is sufficient.They ride off and follow the trail and it isn't long before Marty tries to share his concerns about what they are following with Ethan, but Ethan is dismissive because of Marty's biracial heritage. After several hours of riding, the posse finds Jorgensen's cattle slaughtered in the desert. They realize that a band of Comanche Indians have lured them away from their farms. Because Jorgensen's farm is closest, most of the posse rides there. Ethan, Marty and the slightly demented Mose Harper (Hank Worden) decide to ride for Aaron's farm. But Marty wants to ride off straight away and Ethan knows that the horses won't make it. They need resting for a while. Martin doesn't care and angrily rides off anyway. As dusk sets in,Aaron becomes suspicious at his farm as he hears noises in the distance.Fully aware of what Mose was saying about the Comanches, he and Martha try to stay calm in front of the kids while Aaron picks up a shotgun to pretend he's going to do some hens.Martha starts to close the windows and put out the lights.Lucy realises what is going on and starts to scream in terror.Martha slaps her and tries to calm her and comfort her. They get Debbie out of the window so that she can go off to safety while they prepare for the inevitable.Debbie runs off and sits by an headstone. A shadow looms over her. it is the chief of the tribe, Scar. He blows his horn to call his tribe. Early in the morning,Ethan and Mose ride along and see Martin stood wanting a ride from them. His horse has failed to make the journey but Ethan rides along passed him and Mose follows. Ethan sees that the ranch is burned down and rides down to try to find any survivors from the attack.Aaron, Martha and Ben have been slaughtered, and Lucy and Debbie are missing.As the funeral takes place and the people sing an hymn, Ethan becomes frustrated and just what's to get on with taking revenge. He tells Clayton to cut the prayer short so that they can go searching for Debbie and Lucy. They find a partially buried Indian corpse,who has died apparently from from been wounded during the attack. Ethan shoots the warrior's eyes out to further mutilate the corpse and prevent it from reaching the afterlife. Soon Ethan finds the Comanches setting up camp near a river 20 miles away from where the rest of the posse are.He returns to them and tells them they'll wait until nightfall and attack them. Clayton doesn't think it's a good idea because it could result in Lucy and Debbie been killed. Instead they slowly sneak in but find that they are gone.As they travel along the desert,the Comanches try to get the posse into a trap. They manage to make it to the other side of the river and fend them off in a gun battle,which results in one of them been wounded. As the Comnahces try to collect their dead and injured members,Ethan tries to shoot more of them but Clayton stops him.

There he meets and courts socialite Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), who ends a budding relationship with English gentleman Sir David Karfrey (Rod Taylor) and marries Bick after a whirlwind romance.They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch, Reata, which is owned and run by Luz (Mercedes McCambridge), Bick's older and grumpy sister. Leslie doesn't get along with Luz for Luz scorns Leslie's wealthy background while Leslie thinks that Luz is rude. Jett Rink (James Dean) is a local ranch hand who works for Luz and hopes to find his fortune by leaving Texas; he also has a secret love for Leslie despite the fact that she is married to his boss.One day during a cattle roundup, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs while riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds. Luz dies after War Winds bucks her off, and as part of her will, Jett is given a small plot of land within the 595,000-acre Benedict ranch. Bick tries to buy back the land, but Jett refuses. Jett keeps the fenced off waterhole as his home and names the property Little Reata.A few years later, Leslie eventually gives birth to twins, Jordan ""Jordy"" Benedict III (Dennis Hopper as a teenager and young adult) and Judy Benedict (Fran Bennett as a teen and young adult), and a younger daughter named Luz II (Carroll Baker as a teen and young adult).One day, Jett discovers oil in a footprint left by Leslie and develops an oil drilling well on his property. Bick is annoyed with Jett's prospecting and tries to deny him access to his land. Finally Jett hits his first gusher, he drives into the Benedict yard (covered in crude oil) proclaiming in front of the entire family that he will be richer than the Benedicts. After Jett makes a rude sexual remark to Leslie, Bick and Jett have a fist fight.Shortly after, in the 1930s, Jett starts an oil drilling company, named 'JetTexas' that makes him enormously wealthy. But Bick resists the lure of drilling for oil on his much larger part of the cattle ranch, preferring to remain a rancher to maintain the legacy of his family's original business.During the 1940s, tensions in the Benedict household revolve around how the parents want to bring up their grown-up children. Bick stubbornly insists that Jordy must succeed him and run the ranch, just like his father and grandfather before him, but Jordy wants to be a doctor. Leslie wants Judy to attend finishing school in Switzerland, but Judy loves the ranch and wants to stay in Texas for her education (and to her high school boyfriend).After World War II breaks out, Jett visits the Benedicts and tries to convince Bick to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Bick finally realizes there is no one to take over the ranch after him, and concedes. During this visit, Luz II, now a teen-aged girl, starts flirting with Jett. Once oil production starts, the wealthy Benedict family becomes even wealthier, depicted by the addition of a swimming pool next to the house. Jordy gets married to a young Mexican-American woman and they have a son. Judy gets married to her long-term high school boyfriend and they too have a son.The Benedict/Rink rivalry continues however, and it comes to a head when the Benedicts find out that Luz II and the much older Jett Rink have been dating. At a huge gala Jett organizes in his own honor, an irate Jordy tries to fight him, after realizing he and his Mexican American wife, Juana (Elsa Cárdenas), were invited just so Jett's employees could turn Juana away. Jett has his goons hold Jordy and punches him out in front of the crowd. Fed up, Bick then takes Jett to a kitchen room, about to fight him, but realizes that Jett is now just a drunken shell of a man, who has only his money. He tells him, ""You're not even worth hitting. ... You're all through,"" and leaves, but not before symbolically and quite noisily caving in Rink's wine cellar shelves domino style. The party ends when Jett, completely drunk, slumps down in front of everyone before his big speech. Luz II sees him afterwards, once everyone has left the ballroom, and discovers that he is a lonely, pathetic wreck who can only repeat how much he still loves Leslie.The Benedicts, all except Jordy, drive down an empty road to a diner. An altercation develops between the racist diner owner Sarge (Mickey Simpson) and Bick after he refuses to serve a non-English-speaking Mexican family that just walked in who have no dollars but pesos. Bick intervenes on behalf of the Mexican family. A fist fight ensues when Bick stands up for the immigrant family against the racist Sarge, leaving Bick the loser who collapses over a table of pies. Sarge throws all of them out of the diner saying that it is his American free right to refuse service to people he does not like, including paying customers.Later, in the final scene back at the ranch, Bick and Leslie watch their two grandchildren, one biracial (Jordy and Juana's son), play in a crib and reflect on their life. Leslie tells Bick that she considered him to be her hero for the first time in her life after the fight in the diner, something he always tried to do with his ranching heroics. Reflecting on the Benedict family's legacy, Bick views it as a failure because their lives didn't turn out the way he planned, but Leslie considers their version of the family to be a success. The final shot pans to the face of each child, one white, one Hispanic, but both Texans.","

                    Ambitious Texas-style scale epic that traces the rising and falling fortunes of two generations of Texans. Miscegenation, moral dissipation, racism, the oppression of women....a variety of topics are brought forth during the film's 201-minute running time. The core of the film is actually the relationship between Bick Benedict and his wife Leslie. It is through them that we follow the film's themes of generation, conflict and social change. However, it is Jett Rink whom audiences remember, particularly in the early scenes when he is striding out on his small piece of land or when he comes to tell Benedict that ""my well came in big."" He puts his oily hand on one of the white columns of Benedict's porch and, unemphatically crystallizes the theme of the film - the muddy thumb prints of materialism on the pillars of elegance and the coming of conflict between the aristocracy and the nouveau riche. ""You should have shot that fella a long time ago,"" a friend says to Benedict about Jett Rink. ""Now he's too rich to kill.""

    Synopsis
    In the 1920s, Jordan ""Bick"" Benedict, Jr. (Rock Hudson), head of a wealthy Texas ranching family, travels to Maryland to buy War Winds, a horse he is planning to put out to stud. There he meets and courts socialite Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), who ends a budding relationship with English gentleman Sir David Karfrey (Rod Taylor) and marries Bick after a whirlwind romance.They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch, Reata, which is owned and run by Luz (Mercedes McCambridge), Bick's older and grumpy sister. Leslie doesn't get along with Luz for Luz scorns Leslie's wealthy background while Leslie thinks that Luz is rude. Jett Rink (James Dean) is a local ranch hand who works for Luz and hopes to find his fortune by leaving Texas; he also has a secret love for Leslie despite the fact that she is married to his boss.One day during a cattle roundup, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs while riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds. Luz dies after War Winds bucks her off, and as part of her will, Jett is given a small plot of land within the 595,000-acre Benedict ranch. Bick tries to buy back the land, but Jett refuses. Jett keeps the fenced off waterhole as his home and names the property Little Reata.A few years later, Leslie eventually gives birth to twins, Jordan ""Jordy"" Benedict III (Dennis Hopper as a teenager and young adult) and Judy Benedict (Fran Bennett as a teen and young adult), and a younger daughter named Luz II (Carroll Baker as a teen and young adult).One day, Jett discovers oil in a footprint left by Leslie and develops an oil drilling well on his property. Bick is annoyed with Jett's prospecting and tries to deny him access to his land. Finally Jett hits his first gusher, he drives into the Benedict yard (covered in crude oil) proclaiming in front of the entire family that he will be richer than the Benedicts. After Jett makes a rude sexual remark to Leslie, Bick and Jett have a fist fight.Shortly after, in the 1930s, Jett starts an oil drilling company, named 'JetTexas' that makes him enormously wealthy. But Bick resists the lure of drilling for oil on his much larger part of the cattle ranch, preferring to remain a rancher to maintain the legacy of his family's original business.During the 1940s, tensions in the Benedict household revolve around how the parents want to bring up their grown-up children. Bick stubbornly insists that Jordy must succeed him and run the ranch, just like his father and grandfather before him, but Jordy wants to be a doctor. Leslie wants Judy to attend finishing school in Switzerland, but Judy loves the ranch and wants to stay in Texas for her education (and to her high school boyfriend).After World War II breaks out, Jett visits the Benedicts and tries to convince Bick to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort.

Once oil production starts, the wealthy Benedict family becomes even wealthier, depicted by the addition of a swimming pool next to the house. Jordy gets married to a young Mexican-American woman and they have a son. Judy gets married to her long-term high school boyfriend and they too have a son.The Benedict/Rink rivalry continues however, and it comes to a head when the Benedicts find out that Luz II and the much older Jett Rink have been dating.

An international incident is avoided when Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin), a Frenchman, intercedes on the McKennas' behalf. While Ben is happy to tell Louis all about his family and their planned excursions in Marrakech, his wife Jo is suspicious of the Frenchman's constant questioning.That night, Louis meets the McKennas in their hotel room for dinner, but suddenly cancels their supper plans when Rien (Reggie Nalder), a hired assassin, appears at the McKennas' door. Later, at an Arab restaurant, Ben and Jo meet a British couple, the Draytons (Bernard Miles and Brenda de Banzie), who claim to be fans of Jo, who was a well-known singer prior to her marriage to Ben.The next morning, the McKennas and Draytons meet at the local marketplace. The usual frivolity of the market crowd is broken when a man being chased by the police collapses in Ben's arms, having been fatally stabbed in the back. It is Louis, disguised as an Arab, who, with his dying breaths, tells the physician that there is a plot to assassinate an unnamed statesman in London. With his final breath, Louis tells Ben to get to London to contact the authorities to tell them to ""try Ambrose Chapel"".While the McKennas are taken to the police station for questioning, Mrs. Drayton agrees to care for Hank in their absence. A police detective reveals that Louis Bernard was a spy working for the French government. Just then, Ben receives a telephone call from a mysterious man who informs him that Hank has been kidnapped and threatens to harm him unless the McKennas say nothing to the police about Bernard's last words. After arriving back at the hotel, Ben learns that Mrs. Drayton never arrived back with Hank, and that her husband, Mr. Drayton checked out a half-hour ago.After giving the high-strung Jo a sedative, Ben informs his wife that their only son has been abducted. Aware that the Draytons left Marrakech on a private plane, Ben and Jo decide to go to London and search for Hank there. Greeted at the airport by both Jo's fans and the police, the McKennas are interviewed by Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman) of Scotland Yard, who tells them that he is well aware of the reason why their son was kidnapped. Despite his wife's pleas, Ben refuses to tell the inspector what Louis said to him, claiming that the British secret agent had spoken to him in French. Jo then receives a phone call from Mrs. Drayton, who allows the McKennas to briefly speak to Hank.Checking into a London hotel, the McKennas attempt to call Ambrose Chapel, the name Louis told Ben, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Jo's old acquaintances: Val and Helen Parnell (Alan Mowbray and Alix Talton), Jan Peterson (Hillary Brooke) and Cindy Fontaine (Carolyn Jones). While Jo stays behind with her friends, Ben sneaks out through the hotel's service entrance to meet Chapel. At the Ambrose taxidermy shop, Ben is slow to realize that neither Ambrose Sr. nor Ambrose Jr. is involved in his son's kidnapping, and is forced to make a quick escape before the police arrive.Meanwhile, at the hotel, Jo realizes that ""Ambrose Chapel"" is a place, not a person, and she is soon met there by Ben. Inside the church, Hank is being held captive by the Draytons, whom are the leaders of an international anarchist group. An assistant named Edna is assigned to watch over Hank. Also there is Rien, who is being instructed by the Draytons as to the exact moment during an Albert Hall concert that he is to commit the assassination: at a climactic cymbal crash in the performance of a cantata.The McKennas enter the chapel just as the service, administered by Mr. Drayton, is about to begin. While Ben stays inside, Jo leaves to call the police, so the Draytons cut short the service. Hearing his son's voice, Ben rushes to Hank's aid, only to be knocked unconscious by one of Draytons' henchmen. By the time the police arrive at the chapel, the Draytons have made their escape with Hank. Refusing to enter the locked church without a search warrant, the police leave, so Jo calls the police station, begging for help. She asks to speak to Buchanan, but is told that he is at an important diplomatic function at a concert at Albert Hall. When the policeman refuses to contact Buchanan, she heads off alone to Albert Hall to find him. When Rien sees her there, the assassin reminds Jo that Hank's safety depends on her silence.Meanwhile, Ben escapes the locked chapel by climbing the church bell's rope and also makes his way to the concert. Realizing that Rien is about to shoot a visiting foreign prime minister, Jo screams, causing the startled assassin to merely wound the dignitary in the arm. Ben then jumps Rien, and in his attempt to escape, the assassin falls from the balcony to his death.At the embassy, the Draytons hide out there where are informed by the ambassador (Mogens Wieth) (who hired them for the assassination job) that their assassination attempt on the prime minister has failed. Despite Mrs. Drayton's objection, the ambassador then orders her husband to kill Hank. With the police unable to go into the embassy due to diplomatic immunity, the McKennas enter alone, as the invited guest of the grateful prime minister. Jo is asked to perform for the guests, and her singing voice is soon recognized by Hank. Under Mrs. Drayton's instruction, the young boy whistles along with her singing, guiding Ben to the room in which his son is being held. Mr. Drayton then appears, but rather than killing them, he decides to use Ben and Hank as human shields during his escape from the embassy. As they make their way down the grand staircase, Ben pushes Drayton, and the spy is killed when he falls on his own gun.In the final scene, the reunited McKennas then head back to their hotel room, where Jo's friends have been waiting the entire time.","

With a knife plunged into his back, Frenchman Louis Bernard, who the family met earlier in their bus ride into Marrakesh and who is now masquerading as an Arab, approaches Ben, cryptically whispering into Ben's ears that there will be an attempted assassination in London of a statesman, this news whispered just before Bernard dies. Ben is reluctant to provide any information of this news to the authorities because concurrently Hank is kidnapped by British couple, Edward and Lucy Drayton, who also befriended the McKennas in Marrakesh and who probably have taken Hank out of the country back to England. Whoever the unknown people the Draytons are working for have threatened to kill Hank if Ben divulges any information told to him by Bernard. With what little information they have on hand, Ben and Jo head to London to try and thwart the assassination attempt and more importantly find an alive and safe Hank. Scotland Yard is aware of some pieces to the puzzle, including the fact that Bernard was a French secret service agent and that there will be an assassination attempt on someone. They and the McKennas will have to work together as they hit a diplomatic roadblock, one that may be overcome with a special Jo Conway song.

    Synopsis
    While on an extended European vacation following a medical conference in Paris, American physician Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and his family, whom make up of his wife Jo (Doris Day) and their 11-year-old son Hank (Christopher Olsen) are traveling on a bus in French Morocco when Hank accidentally pulls the veil off a Muslim woman. An international incident is avoided when Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin), a Frenchman, intercedes on the McKennas' behalf. While Ben is happy to tell Louis all about his family and their planned excursions in Marrakech, his wife Jo is suspicious of the Frenchman's constant questioning.That night, Louis meets the McKennas in their hotel room for dinner, but suddenly cancels their supper plans when Rien (Reggie Nalder), a hired assassin, appears at the McKennas' door. Later, at an Arab restaurant, Ben and Jo meet a British couple, the Draytons (Bernard Miles and Brenda de Banzie), who claim to be fans of Jo, who was a well-known singer prior to her marriage to Ben.The next morning, the McKennas and Draytons meet at the local marketplace. The usual frivolity of the market crowd is broken when a man being chased by the police collapses in Ben's arms, having been fatally stabbed in the back. It is Louis, disguised as an Arab, who, with his dying breaths, tells the physician that there is a plot to assassinate an unnamed statesman in London. With his final breath, Louis tells Ben to get to London to contact the authorities to tell them to ""try Ambrose Chapel"".While the McKennas are taken to the police station for questioning, Mrs. Drayton agrees to care for Hank in their absence. A police detective reveals that Louis Bernard was a spy working for the French government. Just then, Ben receives a telephone call from a mysterious man who informs him that Hank has been kidnapped and threatens to harm him unless the McKennas say nothing to the police about Bernard's last words. After arriving back at the hotel, Ben learns that Mrs. Drayton never arrived back with Hank, and that her husband, Mr. Drayton checked out a half-hour ago.After giving the high-strung Jo a sedative, Ben informs his wife that their only son has been abducted. Aware that the Draytons left Marrakech on a private plane, Ben and Jo decide to go to London and search for Hank there. Greeted at the airport by both Jo's fans and the police, the McKennas are interviewed by Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman) of Scotland Yard, who tells them that he is well aware of the reason why their son was kidnapped. Despite his wife's pleas, Ben refuses to tell the inspector what Louis said to him, claiming that the British secret agent had spoken to him in French. Jo then receives a phone call from Mrs. Drayton, who allows the McKennas to briefly speak to Hank.Checking into a London hotel, the McKennas attempt to call Ambrose Chapel, the name Louis told Ben, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Jo's old acquaintances: Val and Helen Parnell (Alan Mowbray and Alix Talton), Jan Peterson (Hillary Brooke) and Cindy Fontaine (Carolyn Jones). While Jo stays behind with her friends, Ben sneaks out through the hotel's service entrance to meet Chapel. At the Ambrose taxidermy shop, Ben is slow to realize that neither Ambrose Sr. nor Ambrose Jr. is involved in his son's kidnapping, and is forced to make a quick escape before the police arrive.Meanwhile, at the hotel, Jo realizes that ""Ambrose Chapel"" is a place, not a person, and she is soon met there by Ben. Inside the church, Hank is being held captive by the Draytons, whom are the leaders of an international anarchist group. An assistant named Edna is assigned to watch over Hank. Also there is Rien, who is being instructed by the Draytons as to the exact moment during an Albert Hall concert that he is to commit the assassination: at a climactic cymbal crash in the performance of a cantata.The McKennas enter the chapel just as the service, administered by Mr. Drayton, is about to begin. While Ben stays inside, Jo leaves to call the police, so the Draytons cut short the service. Hearing his son's voice, Ben rushes to Hank's aid, only to be knocked unconscious by one of Draytons' henchmen. By the time the police arrive at the chapel, the Draytons have made their escape with Hank. Refusing to enter the locked church without a search warrant, the police leave, so Jo calls the police station, begging for help. She asks to speak to Buchanan, but is told that he is at an important diplomatic function at a concert at Albert Hall. When the policeman refuses to contact Buchanan, she heads off alone to Albert Hall to find him. When Rien sees her there, the assassin reminds Jo that Hank's safety depends on her silence.Meanwhile, Ben escapes the locked chapel by climbing the church bell's rope and also makes his way to the concert. Realizing that Rien is about to shoot a visiting foreign prime minister, Jo screams, causing the startled assassin to merely wound the dignitary in the arm. Ben then jumps Rien, and in his attempt to escape, the assassin falls from the balcony to his death.At the embassy, the Draytons hide out there where are informed by the ambassador (Mogens Wieth) (who hired them for the assassination job) that their assassination attempt on the prime minister has failed. Despite Mrs. Drayton's objection, the ambassador then orders her husband to kill Hank. With the police unable to go into the embassy due to diplomatic immunity, the McKennas enter alone, as the invited guest of the grateful prime minister. Jo is asked to perform for the guests, and her singing voice is soon recognized by Hank. Under Mrs. Drayton's instruction, the young boy whistles along with her singing, guiding Ben to the room in which his son is being held. Mr. Drayton then appears, but rather than killing them, he decides to use Ben and Hank as human shields during his escape from the embassy. As they make their way down the grand staircase, Ben pushes Drayton, and the spy is killed when he falls on his own gun.In the final scene, the reunited McKennas then head back to their hotel room, where Jo's friends have been waiting the entire time.

"9","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048977/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Lovely, well-to-do Christine Bravo Penmark has everything: a loving, well-paid husband with a respectable career (as an Air Force colonel, no less), a swank apartment in a respectable part of town, and an adorable, cherubic eight-year-old daughter. But as Col. Kenneth Penmark leaves for an assignment in Washington, DC, the strains that have lurked beneath the surface of the Penmark household now begin to manifest. For example, her daughter Rhoda gives every indication of being a grasping, greedy child, whom their landlady, Monica Breedlove, indulges with extravagant presents that Rhoda gives some indication of not being satisfied with. For another, Rhoda protests loudly and resentfully when reminded that she had lost a penmanship competition, saying that she ought to have won first place, and the medal that goes with that honor.The apartment-house handyman, Leroy, presents another complication. Though an adult, he seems to have an eight-year-old mind himself. He is also mean and spiteful, and regularly spars with Rhoda.Rhoda leaves for a school picnic, wearing two shoes that have been modified with iron plates to make them sound like tap shoes. As she leaves, Leroy sprays her shoes with the garden hose, earning a stern reprimand from Monica. Leroy nurses resentment of Mrs. Breedlove, a lustful attitude toward Christine, and a clear enmity toward Rhoda.At the picnic, Christine tries to sound out Claudia Fern, the headmistress of Rhoda's school, about how Rhoda is fitting in and getting along. Miss Fern at first is effusive in her praise of Rhoda but then becomes evasive and abruptly excuses herself. Christine confesses at this point that Rhoda seems overly mature for her age, in a ""disturbing"" manner.That afternoon, Christine entertains her ""psychiatry club,"" at which Monica fairly boasts of having been under analysis by some of the most droppable names in the profession of psychiatry. (That she could actually have been a patient of Sigmund Freud, as she boasts, is a stretch, and her fellow clubbers seem to know it.) Then, as the club starts to discuss a case of a recently convicted serial murderess, Christine finds the conversation disturbing, prompting Monica to tease her about it. The conversation then continues onto the case of one Bessie Denker, a name that Christine recognizes but won't elaborate on.In the middle of this conversation, someone turns on the radio, and the announcer gives a shocking report: that Claude Daigle, a fellow student of Rhoda's, has drowned on an old, rickety pier that the students had been forbidden to play on or near. As expected, the school bus brings Rhoda home early--and Rhoda, far from being in any to-be-expected state of shock, seems to care nothing about the death of her classmate, and casually asks for a peanut-butter sandwich and a glass of milk, and then goes out roller-skating. The one adult who takes the most notice of Rhoda's casual attitude is the handyman, Leroy. He says flat-out that she's not even sorry that he died, and Rhoda half-innocently, half-sardonically asks why she should feel sorry. As she skates away, Leroy forms a resolve to find something to scare her with, thinking only as an eight-year-old thinks, to ""take her down a peg.""A few days later, Claudia Fern comes to visit Christine, and to reveal some startling information: that Rhoda was the last student to see Claude Daigle alive, and that Claude's penmanship medal, which he had worn to the picnic, was now missing. Miss Fern also reveals that Rhoda had been pestering Claude all morning, trying to snatch his medal from him. Furthermore, Miss Fern reveals that a lifeguard had shouted a warning to a girl answering to Rhoda's description, as she was coming off the wharf.Christine now remembers that Claudia Fern and her sisters never asked Christine to pay for a share of the flowers for Claude Daigle's funeral, and Miss Fern states that she thought that Christine would prefer to send flowers individually. Now Christine asks flatly why Miss Fern would take that attitude, and ask Christine Penmark about the missing medal. In reply, Miss Fern reveals what she had earlier not wanted to discuss with Christine: that Rhoda has no sense of fair play, is a sore loser, and has earned the enmity of all the other pupils in the school. Furthermore, Miss Fern announces that Rhoda will not be welcome when school takes up again in the following fall. This prompts Christine to ask Miss Fern flat-out whether she supposes that Rhoda had anything to do with Claude's death. Shocked, Miss Fern disclaims any such suspicion, but her behavior indicates that, whether she harbored such a suspicion or not, her sisters do.Their conversation is interrupted when Hortense Daigle, the dead boy's mother, stumbles into the apartment, drunk and barely able to walk in a straight line, followed closely by Henry Daigle, her embarrassed husband. Mrs. Daigle sarcastically observes that Christine is her social superior, an ""honor"" that Christine hastily disclaims, and then comes to the point of her visit: she demands to know what became of the penmanship medal, and what Miss Fern, concerned as she probably is with liability issues, won't reveal. Mrs. Daigle also reveals that Claude, when found, had bruises on his hand and a crescent-moon-shaped wound on his forehead. In the end Mrs. Daigle becomes terrifically angry, and then almost collapses in tears, allowing her otherwise-ineffectual husband to lead her away. After Hortense leaves, Christine and Miss Fern have a tearful parting. Shortly after this, Col. Penmark calls to ask about the accident, and to reveal that his Washington assignment will last at least another four weeks.When Monica calls and asks Christine to lend her a locket that she had given Rhoda, so that she can have its gemstone changed, Christine is horrified to find the penmanship medal in Rhoda's little ""treasure chest."" She then shows the medal to Rhoda and demands that Rhoda explain how she came by the medal. Rhoda at first tries to change the subject, then denies that she had had the medal, then tells a variety of stories that Christine recognizes as false almost at once, and finally says that she had somehow persuaded Claude to let her hold the medal, and then had gone out onto the pier and fallen in later on. In between these activities, Rhoda indulges in a bit of flattery that now seems anything but flattering. Then Christine recalls a fatal accident that had happened to a neighbor in Wichita, KS, an accident by which Rhoda came into possession of a keepsake belonging to the neighbor. Christine finally announces her intention to call Miss Fern, intending to surrender the medal, but Rhoda, in a frightened tone, begs her not to, saying that the school officials don't like her and were persecuting her. Miss Fern is not available, and Rhoda seems to care most of all about retaining the medal, insisting that she, not Claude, had actually earned it.Back in Washington, Col. Penmark buys an expensive children's tea set for Rhoda and has it shipped to Rhoda, packed in excelsior. Rhoda goes out to play with it, and takes the packing material with her. Leroy sees her at play, and begins his scare campaign by accusing her of beating Claude Daigle with a stick and saying that she could never clean a murder weapon enough to remove all trace of blood, that the police have ""stick bloodhounds"" that can find a thrown-away stick in any forest, and that the police laboratory will sprinkle ""blood powder"" on a blood-soaked stick and make it turn blue. Rhoda, for her part, gives Leroy the excelsior, saying that she knows about the bed of excelsior that Leroy has made for himself so that he can sleep on the job in the furnace room without being caught. Nor is she afraid of Leroy's accusations, saying that he made them all up. Christine catches Leroy talking to Rhoda and warns him never to speak to Rhoda again, or she will report him to Monica Breedlove.When Rhoda comes back into the house, she asks her mother about police tests for blood. Christine offers to ask Miss Fern about it, but again Rhoda does not want Christine to ask Miss Fern any such thing. Christine instructs Rhoda to go up to Mrs. Breedlove's apartment for dinner, while the famous psychiatrist Reginald Tasker dines in the Penmark apartment with the local ""psychiatry club."" Mr. Tasker reveals that he has great respect for Christine's father, Richard Bravo, who had been quite an authority on crime and criminals in his younger days. Tasker and Bravo engage in good-natured professional sparring, and also discuss Christine Penmark's own dreams of writing a murder mystery. Christine asks Tasker whether children ever commit murder, and Tasker says that they do, and even that many adult criminals begin their careers in childhood. Christine insists that criminals are made in bad environments, but Tasker insists that some criminals are born that way, that they are ""bad seeds,"" possessing atavistic, consciousless minds, and even that one might inherit a tendency to criminality. Richard Bravo refuses to accept such a theory, but Tasker politely stands by his theory, and even states that a child criminal would not present a sour countenance at all, but would instead present a quite convincing ""normal"" and ""innocent"" manner.Then the conversation turns to the case of Bessie Denker, one of Richard Bravo's own case-history subjects. Bravo wants to avoid the subject, but Christine insists, and Tasker reveals that Ms. Denker vanished without a trace before the authorities could make an arrest. Tasker even remembers that Ms. Denker left a child behind, a part of the story that Bravo hastily denies. Shortly after making this revelation, Tasker leaves.Now that Christine and her father are alone together, Mr. Bravo challenges Christine with the worry that shows plainly on her countenance. Now Christine starts to talk freely of her fear of having been an adopted child, and not the actual daughter of Richard Bravo and his wife. Christine also says that her concerns about Rhoda have prompted a return of her old fear. She mentions a recurring nightmare that she had always talked to Richard about, but Mr. Bravo clearly does not want to discuss it, and especially does not want Christine to lend credence to the inherited-criminality theory.But now Mr. Bravo reveals that he did find Christine in ""a very strange place."" Then Christine reveals her recurring nightmare, about living in a farmhouse with her brother and a very beautiful lady, then not having a brother anymore, then being terrified of being in the room, then being outside in an orchard. Finally she remembers the name she originally had: her name was not Christine Bravo at all, but Ingold Denker, Bessie Denker's daughter.This, then, is the truth: Richard Bravo found Ingold Denker, whom he renamed Christine, in the orchard on the Denker farm after Bessie Denker had died. But Christine now feels that she would have done better to die, because she is afraid that she inherited a tendency to extreme criminality from her real mother, Bessie Denker--and passed this on to her own daughter, Rhoda Penmark.At this moment, Monica Breedlove returns with Rhoda. Rhoda greets her grandfather cheerfully, but now Richard Bravo takes a long, hard look at his granddaughter, though he will not explain his misgivings. Bravo agrees to stay in a spare room in Monica's apartment overnight.Later, Christine catches Rhoda trying to dispose of something in a paper bag. Rhoda doesn't want to reveal the contents of the bag, so Christine struggles with Rhoda and forces her to reveal what she had been trying to dispose of: her shoes with the iron half-moon reinforcements. Now Rhoda knows the horrible truth and extracts a confession from her: that Rhoda killed Claude Daigle by beating him with her toe shoes, after he had refused to let her handle his penmanship medal. After the first blow, Claude surrendered the medal, and then tried to escape, and Rhoda struck him again, and again, until he fell in the water. When he tried to climb back onto the wharf, Rhoda beat the backs of his hands with her shoes to make him let go, and so he drowned. Rhoda also confesses something else: that she had in fact deliberately caused their neighbor in Wichita to fall on some ice. Christine, totally distraught, instructs Rhoda to throw the shoes into the incinerator slot and say nothing to anyone. Rhoda again asks about the medal, and Christine half-promises not to give the medal back to Miss Fern.The next morning, Richard Bravo leaves, and Leroy again tries to tease Rhoda. This time Leroy says that if the police find the stick with which she killed Claude Daigle, they'll sentence her to death in the electric chair, and even that the police have his-and-her child-sized electric chairs. Next, Leroy says that he hasn't seen her in her tap shoes, and now says that he knows that she hit Claude Daigle with the shoes, and even that he has retrieved them from the incinerator. That last boast causes Rhoda to take alarm and demand that Leroy return the shoes. At last Leroy has found something to scare her with, and he presses his point--and finally realizes that she really did the deed, and that's the reason why she is scared and is demanding the return of the shoes.In fact, Leroy did not retrieve the shoes when he said he did, but after Christine chases Leroy away from Rhoda a second time, Leroy opens the incinerator and finds the shoes, but is now too afraid to say anything. Christine, for her part, reprimands Rhoda for talking about this subject after they had agreed never to speak of it to anyone.When Monica calls to give Rhoda the locket, after it has been modified, Rhoda asks permission to catch the ice-cream man and buy a popsicle. On her way, Rhoda tries to steal several matches. Christine tells her to replace them, but manages to hide two of them. When Rhoda leaves, Monica probes Christine, knowing that something is troubling her, but not knowing what. Monica offers to give Christine some sleeping pills to help her sleep. Christine collapses in a pool of tears, but still is afraid to tell Monica anything. At that moment, Hortense Daigle, drunk as before, returns to the apartment, seeking yet another confrontation, not only with Christine, but this time also with Rhoda. Hortense has by now tried to talk to Miss Fern a dozen times without result, and has also spoken to the lifeguard from the fatal picnic. What she now knows makes her firmly suspect Rhoda of something, though she is not even sure herself what she suspects. Hortense does not succeed in getting the information she seeks, or in scaring Rhoda (because Monica hastily takes Rhoda away on a pretext). But she does succeed in frightening Christine very badly before her husband finally shows up to take her home again.After Hortense leaves, Christine starts to call Col. Penmark, but despairs of having anything constructive to tell him. Monica returns and reveals that she allowed Rhoda to go out and buy another popsicle. Rhoda then comes back into the apartment, crosses to the music room, and starts again to play her favorite tune, ""Au clair de la lune,"" on the piano over and over--slowly at first, and then faster and faster until she is playing it at break-neck speed. While she is playing, Christine hears a man's voice from below, screaming at the top of his voice for someone to let him out. She then hears a desperate knocking from inside the sloping cellar door, and then sees a cloud of smoke emanating from that cellar. Monica's brother Emory and Mr. Tasker, who is still staying in the house, try desperately to break the cellar door open, but before they can get in, the screams rise to a blood-curdling crescendo and then stop. The owner of that voice was Leroy, who has, quite simply, burned to death.Christine now suffers a nervous breakdown and starts to strike the dining-room table with her right hand and babble about being blind, and finally screams at Rhoda to stop playing that piano tune over and over. When Rhoda does come out of the room, Monica has to restrain Christine from striking Rhoda. Christine then collapses in tears as she confronts the realization that Rhoda has killed yet another person. But Christine blames herself, not Rhoda, because Christine is now fully convinced that Rhoda inherited her murderous tendencies from Christine herself.That night, she induces Rhoda to confess to killing Leroy, which Rhoda does, all the while insisting that the fault was not hers, but Leroy's, because Leroy shouldn't have scared her with his loose talk about police investigations, evidence, and little blue and pink electric chairs for children. Christine reveals at this point that she has dropped Claude Daigle's medal onto the pilings at the pier where he drowned.Finally, Christine gives Rhoda what she says are ""new vitamins,"" but are actually sleeping pills, in an amount that is obviously an overdose. After putting Rhoda to bed, Christine shoots herself with Col. Penmark's revolver that they keep in the apartment. Two days later, Mr. Bravo and Col. Penmark, both returned from their respective cities, discuss the apparent attempt at murder and suicide. Rhoda recovers completely, but Christine must stay in the hospital to recover. Col. Penmark takes Rhoda home, but Richard Bravo asks the hospital doctor whether Christine had mumbled anything while he was attending to her. The doctor remembers that she kept repeating the phrase ""bad seed"" over and over. Mr. Bravo says that Christine was about to write a book about inherited criminality, but the doctor, as Mr. Bravo had done, totally rejects the theory, saying that no one would dare bear or adopt children if that were the case.Col. Penmark puts Rhoda to bed and then waits up. He takes a call from the hospital, as Christine desperately wants to confess to Kenneth that she has ""sinned a great sin."" The colonel says that whatever the problem is, they will face it together.Rhoda, meanwhile, has put on her raincoat and sou'wester and gone out of the house. She walks all the way to the Fern school grounds, and onto the wharf where Claude died. Rhoda wants, quite simply, to retrieve the medal. Using a flashlight, she spots the medal underwater, and takes an old fishing net to try to snag it. Lightning strikes her and knocks her into the water.The movie, as such, ends here--but then a casting-call sequence appears in which the actors playing the various parts introduce themselves. Rhoda appears next to last, and finally Christine--but then Christine steps toward Rhoda, seizes her, turns her over her knee, and gives her a sound spanking. The last frame is a plea to the audience not to reveal the ""unusual climax.""","
    
                    Christine Penmark seems to have it all: a lovely home, a loving husband and the most ""perfect"" daughter in the world. But since childhood, Christine has suffered from the most terrible recurring nightmare. And her ""perfect"" daughter's accomplishments include lying, theft and possibly much, much worse.

                    Colonel Kenneth and Mrs. Christine Penmark are a loving couple, which makes it difficult in their lives when the colonel is transferred to Washington D.C. While the colonel is gone, Christine is left to take care of their eight year old daughter, Rhoda, on her own. Rhoda is a little princess of a girl, always wearing pretty dresses and with her hair always in perfect pigtails. Rhoda strives for perfection and feels she deserves whatever nice things comes her way, since she is continually asking for gifts beyond what people are already willing to give. Although Christine loves her daughter as does the colonel, she feels that Rhoda perhaps is a little too mature for her age, not displaying those typical tendencies of most eight year olds. The one person who doesn't seem to like Rhoda is Leroy, the seemingly simple handyman of the apartment building in which the Penmarks live. Tragedy strikes when one of Rhoda's classmates, Claude Daigle, drowns in a lake while at a school picnic. Claude was recently discussed in the Penmark home as the boy who won the class penmanship medal, the medal which Rhoda felt she herself deserved. Rhoda shows no emotion about the tragedy. As the authorities and the parents discuss what happened, Christine increasingly believes that Rhoda knows more about Claude's death than she is willing to divulge. Although prone to the same dream for the better part of her life, Christine begins to wonder if that dream, which outlines an alternate childhood for herself, is really a dream or a repressed memory. That dream leads Christine to find out more about what Rhoda's true involvement in Claude's death is as well as the cause of other tragic deaths that have occurred around them.

As she leaves, Leroy sprays her shoes with the garden hose, earning a stern reprimand from Monica. Leroy nurses resentment of Mrs. Breedlove, a lustful attitude toward Christine, and a clear enmity toward Rhoda.At the picnic, Christine tries to sound out Claudia Fern, the headmistress of Rhoda's school, about how Rhoda is fitting in and getting along. Miss Fern at first is effusive in her praise of Rhoda but then becomes evasive and abruptly excuses herself. Christine confesses at this point that Rhoda seems overly mature for her age, in a ""disturbing"" manner.That afternoon, Christine entertains her ""psychiatry club,"" at which Monica fairly boasts of having been under analysis by some of the most droppable names in the profession of psychiatry. (That she could actually have been a patient of Sigmund Freud, as she boasts, is a stretch, and her fellow clubbers seem to know it.) Then, as the club starts to discuss a case of a recently convicted serial murderess, Christine finds the conversation disturbing, prompting Monica to tease her about it. The conversation then continues onto the case of one Bessie Denker, a name that Christine recognizes but won't elaborate on.In the middle of this conversation, someone turns on the radio, and the announcer gives a shocking report: that Claude Daigle, a fellow student of Rhoda's, has drowned on an old, rickety pier that the students had been forbidden to play on or near. As expected, the school bus brings Rhoda home early--and Rhoda, far from being in any to-be-expected state of shock, seems to care nothing about the death of her classmate, and casually asks for a peanut-butter sandwich and a glass of milk, and then goes out roller-skating. The one adult who takes the most notice of Rhoda's casual attitude is the handyman, Leroy. He says flat-out that she's not even sorry that he died, and Rhoda half-innocently, half-sardonically asks why she should feel sorry. As she skates away, Leroy forms a resolve to find something to scare her with, thinking only as an eight-year-old thinks, to ""take her down a peg.""A few days later, Claudia Fern comes to visit Christine, and to reveal some startling information: that Rhoda was the last student to see Claude Daigle alive, and that Claude's penmanship medal, which he had worn to the picnic, was now missing. Miss Fern also reveals that Rhoda had been pestering Claude all morning, trying to snatch his medal from him. Furthermore, Miss Fern reveals that a lifeguard had shouted a warning to a girl answering to Rhoda's description, as she was coming off the wharf.Christine now remembers that Claudia Fern and her sisters never asked Christine to pay for a share of the flowers for Claude Daigle's funeral, and Miss Fern states that she thought that Christine would prefer to send flowers individually. Now Christine asks flatly why Miss Fern would take that attitude, and ask Christine Penmark about the missing medal. In reply, Miss Fern reveals what she had earlier not wanted to discuss with Christine: that Rhoda has no sense of fair play, is a sore loser, and has earned the enmity of all the other pupils in the school. Furthermore, Miss Fern announces that Rhoda will not be welcome when school takes up again in the following fall. This prompts Christine to ask Miss Fern flat-out whether she supposes that Rhoda had anything to do with Claude's death. Shocked, Miss Fern disclaims any such suspicion, but her behavior indicates that, whether she harbored such a suspicion or not, her sisters do.Their conversation is interrupted when Hortense Daigle, the dead boy's mother, stumbles into the apartment, drunk and barely able to walk in a straight line, followed closely by Henry Daigle, her embarrassed husband. Mrs. Daigle sarcastically observes that Christine is her social superior, an ""honor"" that Christine hastily disclaims, and then comes to the point of her visit: she demands to know what became of the penmanship medal, and what Miss Fern, concerned as she probably is with liability issues, won't reveal. Mrs. Daigle also reveals that Claude, when found, had bruises on his hand and a crescent-moon-shaped wound on his forehead. In the end Mrs. Daigle becomes terrifically angry, and then almost collapses in tears, allowing her otherwise-ineffectual husband to lead her away. After Hortense leaves, Christine and Miss Fern have a tearful parting. Shortly after this, Col. Penmark calls to ask about the accident, and to reveal that his Washington assignment will last at least another four weeks.When Monica calls and asks Christine to lend her a locket that she had given Rhoda, so that she can have its gemstone changed, Christine is horrified to find the penmanship medal in Rhoda's little ""treasure chest."" She then shows the medal to Rhoda and demands that Rhoda explain how she came by the medal. Rhoda at first tries to change the subject, then denies that she had had the medal, then tells a variety of stories that Christine recognizes as false almost at once, and finally says that she had somehow persuaded Claude to let her hold the medal, and then had gone out onto the pier and fallen in later on. In between these activities, Rhoda indulges in a bit of flattery that now seems anything but flattering. Then Christine recalls a fatal accident that had happened to a neighbor in Wichita, KS, an accident by which Rhoda came into possession of a keepsake belonging to the neighbor. Christine finally announces her intention to call Miss Fern, intending to surrender the medal, but Rhoda, in a frightened tone, begs her not to, saying that the school officials don't like her and were persecuting her. Miss Fern is not available, and Rhoda seems to care most of all about retaining the medal, insisting that she, not Claude, had actually earned it.Back in Washington, Col. Penmark buys an expensive children's tea set for Rhoda and has it shipped to Rhoda, packed in excelsior. Rhoda goes out to play with it, and takes the packing material with her. Leroy sees her at play, and begins his scare campaign by accusing her of beating Claude Daigle with a stick and saying that she could never clean a murder weapon enough to remove all trace of blood, that the police have ""stick bloodhounds"" that can find a thrown-away stick in any forest, and that the police laboratory will sprinkle ""blood powder"" on a blood-soaked stick and make it turn blue. Rhoda, for her part, gives Leroy the excelsior, saying that she knows about the bed of excelsior that Leroy has made for himself so that he can sleep on the job in the furnace room without being caught. Nor is she afraid of Leroy's accusations, saying that he made them all up. Christine catches Leroy talking to Rhoda and warns him never to speak to Rhoda again, or she will report him to Monica Breedlove.When Rhoda comes back into the house, she asks her mother about police tests for blood. Christine offers to ask Miss Fern about it, but again Rhoda does not want Christine to ask Miss Fern any such thing. Christine instructs Rhoda to go up to Mrs. Breedlove's apartment for dinner, while the famous psychiatrist Reginald Tasker dines in the Penmark apartment with the local ""psychiatry club."" Mr. Tasker reveals that he has great respect for Christine's father, Richard Bravo, who had been quite an authority on crime and criminals in his younger days. Tasker and Bravo engage in good-natured professional sparring, and also discuss Christine Penmark's own dreams of writing a murder mystery. Christine asks Tasker whether children ever commit murder, and Tasker says that they do, and even that many adult criminals begin their careers in childhood. Christine insists that criminals are made in bad environments, but Tasker insists that some criminals are born that way, that they are ""bad seeds,"" possessing atavistic, consciousless minds, and even that one might inherit a tendency to criminality. Richard Bravo refuses to accept such a theory, but Tasker politely stands by his theory, and even states that a child criminal would not present a sour countenance at all, but would instead present a quite convincing ""normal"" and ""innocent"" manner.Then the conversation turns to the case of Bessie Denker, one of Richard Bravo's own case-history subjects. Bravo wants to avoid the subject, but Christine insists, and Tasker reveals that Ms. Denker vanished without a trace before the authorities could make an arrest. Tasker even remembers that Ms. Denker left a child behind, a part of the story that Bravo hastily denies. Shortly after making this revelation, Tasker leaves.Now that Christine and her father are alone together, Mr. Bravo challenges Christine with the worry that shows plainly on her countenance. Now Christine starts to talk freely of her fear of having been an adopted child, and not the actual daughter of Richard Bravo and his wife. Christine also says that her concerns about Rhoda have prompted a return of her old fear. She mentions a recurring nightmare that she had always talked to Richard about, but Mr. Bravo clearly does not want to discuss it, and especially does not want Christine to lend credence to the inherited-criminality theory.But now Mr. Bravo reveals that he did find Christine in ""a very strange place."" Then Christine reveals her recurring nightmare, about living in a farmhouse with her brother and a very beautiful lady, then not having a brother anymore, then being terrified of being in the room, then being outside in an orchard. Finally she remembers the name she originally had: her name was not Christine Bravo at all, but Ingold Denker, Bessie Denker's daughter.This, then, is the truth: Richard Bravo found Ingold Denker, whom he renamed Christine, in the orchard on the Denker farm after Bessie Denker had died. But Christine now feels that she would have done better to die, because she is afraid that she inherited a tendency to extreme criminality from her real mother, Bessie Denker--and passed this on to her own daughter, Rhoda Penmark.At this moment, Monica Breedlove returns with Rhoda. Rhoda greets her grandfather cheerfully, but now Richard Bravo takes a long, hard look at his granddaughter, though he will not explain his misgivings. Bravo agrees to stay in a spare room in Monica's apartment overnight.Later, Christine catches Rhoda trying to dispose of something in a paper bag. Rhoda doesn't want to reveal the contents of the bag, so Christine struggles with Rhoda and forces her to reveal what she had been trying to dispose of: her shoes with the iron half-moon reinforcements. Now Rhoda knows the horrible truth and extracts a confession from her: that Rhoda killed Claude Daigle by beating him with her toe shoes, after he had refused to let her handle his penmanship medal. After the first blow, Claude surrendered the medal, and then tried to escape, and Rhoda struck him again, and again, until he fell in the water. When he tried to climb back onto the wharf, Rhoda beat the backs of his hands with her shoes to make him let go, and so he drowned. Rhoda also confesses something else: that she had in fact deliberately caused their neighbor in Wichita to fall on some ice. Christine, totally distraught, instructs Rhoda to throw the shoes into the incinerator slot and say nothing to anyone. Rhoda again asks about the medal, and Christine half-promises not to give the medal back to Miss Fern.The next morning, Richard Bravo leaves, and Leroy again tries to tease Rhoda. This time Leroy says that if the police find the stick with which she killed Claude Daigle, they'll sentence her to death in the electric chair, and even that the police have his-and-her child-sized electric chairs. Next, Leroy says that he hasn't seen her in her tap shoes, and now says that he knows that she hit Claude Daigle with the shoes, and even that he has retrieved them from the incinerator. That last boast causes Rhoda to take alarm and demand that Leroy return the shoes. At last Leroy has found something to scare her with, and he presses his point--and finally realizes that she really did the deed, and that's the reason why she is scared and is demanding the return of the shoes.In fact, Leroy did not retrieve the shoes when he said he did, but after Christine chases Leroy away from Rhoda a second time, Leroy opens the incinerator and finds the shoes, but is now too afraid to say anything. Christine, for her part, reprimands Rhoda for talking about this subject after they had agreed never to speak of it to anyone.When Monica calls to give Rhoda the locket, after it has been modified, Rhoda asks permission to catch the ice-cream man and buy a popsicle. On her way, Rhoda tries to steal several matches. Christine tells her to replace them, but manages to hide two of them. When Rhoda leaves, Monica probes Christine, knowing that something is troubling her, but not knowing what. Monica offers to give Christine some sleeping pills to help her sleep. Christine collapses in a pool of tears, but still is afraid to tell Monica anything. At that moment, Hortense Daigle, drunk as before, returns to the apartment, seeking yet another confrontation, not only with Christine, but this time also with Rhoda. Hortense has by now tried to talk to Miss Fern a dozen times without result, and has also spoken to the lifeguard from the fatal picnic. What she now knows makes her firmly suspect Rhoda of something, though she is not even sure herself what she suspects. Hortense does not succeed in getting the information she seeks, or in scaring Rhoda (because Monica hastily takes Rhoda away on a pretext). But she does succeed in frightening Christine very badly before her husband finally shows up to take her home again.After Hortense leaves, Christine starts to call Col. Penmark, but despairs of having anything constructive to tell him. Monica returns and reveals that she allowed Rhoda to go out and buy another popsicle. Rhoda then comes back into the apartment, crosses to the music room, and starts again to play her favorite tune, ""Au clair de la lune,"" on the piano over and over--slowly at first, and then faster and faster until she is playing it at break-neck speed. While she is playing, Christine hears a man's voice from below, screaming at the top of his voice for someone to let him out. She then hears a desperate knocking from inside the sloping cellar door, and then sees a cloud of smoke emanating from that cellar. Monica's brother Emory and Mr. Tasker, who is still staying in the house, try desperately to break the cellar door open, but before they can get in, the screams rise to a blood-curdling crescendo and then stop. The owner of that voice was Leroy, who has, quite simply, burned to death.Christine now suffers a nervous breakdown and starts to strike the dining-room table with her right hand and babble about being blind, and finally screams at Rhoda to stop playing that piano tune over and over. When Rhoda does come out of the room, Monica has to restrain Christine from striking Rhoda. Christine then collapses in tears as she confronts the realization that Rhoda has killed yet another person. But Christine blames herself, not Rhoda, because Christine is now fully convinced that Rhoda inherited her murderous tendencies from Christine herself.That night, she induces Rhoda to confess to killing Leroy, which Rhoda does, all the while insisting that the fault was not hers, but Leroy's, because Leroy shouldn't have scared her with his loose talk about police investigations, evidence, and little blue and pink electric chairs for children. Christine reveals at this point that she has dropped Claude Daigle's medal onto the pilings at the pier where he drowned.Finally, Christine gives Rhoda what she says are ""new vitamins,"" but are actually sleeping pills, in an amount that is obviously an overdose. After putting Rhoda to bed, Christine shoots herself with Col. Penmark's revolver that they keep in the apartment. Two days later, Mr. Bravo and Col. Penmark, both returned from their respective cities, discuss the apparent attempt at murder and suicide. Rhoda recovers completely, but Christine must stay in the hospital to recover. Col. Penmark takes Rhoda home, but Richard Bravo asks the hospital doctor whether Christine had mumbled anything while he was attending to her. The doctor remembers that she kept repeating the phrase ""bad seed"" over and over. Mr. Bravo says that Christine was about to write a book about inherited criminality, but the doctor, as Mr. Bravo had done, totally rejects the theory, saying that no one would dare bear or adopt children if that were the case.Col. Penmark puts Rhoda to bed and then waits up. He takes a call from the hospital, as Christine desperately wants to confess to Kenneth that she has ""sinned a great sin."" The colonel says that whatever the problem is, they will face it together.Rhoda, meanwhile, has put on her raincoat and sou'wester and gone out of the house. She walks all the way to the Fern school grounds, and onto the wharf where Claude died. Rhoda wants, quite simply, to retrieve the medal. Using a flashlight, she spots the medal underwater, and takes an old fishing net to try to snag it. Lightning strikes her and knocks her into the water.The movie, as such, ends here--but then a casting-call sequence appears in which the actors playing the various parts introduce themselves. Rhoda appears next to last, and finally Christine--but then Christine steps toward Rhoda, seizes her, turns her over her knee, and gives her a sound spanking. The last frame is a plea to the audience not to reveal the ""unusual climax.""

"11","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049513/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","MOBY DICKA man is seen walking along hilly terrain near the sea. When he walks nearer to the camera and we see his face in closeup, we hear the words ""Call me Ishmael,"" He is the narrator (Richard Basehart), a young man who has experience in the merchant marine but has recently decided to see a different world by signing on to a whaling ship. By nightfall he arrives at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and agrees to share a bed with a then absent stranger. He enjoys drinks at the inn and as he waits for night he is told of the rules for seeking work on whaling ships by Stubb (Harry Andrews). He is questioned, and after his answers are deemed satisfactory he is accepted by a group of seamen and he joins in drinking songs with them. During the storm, they spot the mysterious Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) walking in the rainWhen his room and bed mate, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur), returns very late and discovers Ishmael in the bed under the blankets, both men are alarmed, but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together on a whaling ship.The duo signs on with the Pequod, a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. Two owner partners make the hiring decisions and negotiate the compensation, which is a fraction of the profit from the voyage. They are suspicious of Queequeg but he shows his marksmanship with the harpoon and they gladly accept him at 1/300 fraction, where Ishmael only gets 1/600. The ships captain, Ahab, is nowhere to be seen; nevertheless, the owners speak of his solid reputation and legendary experience.On a church near the ships, townspeople and seamen gather for a Sunday service. The pastor, Father Mapple (Orson Welles) gives a sermon based on the story of Jonah and how after his earnest prayer he was saved from the great whale.The two pals encounter a man on the dock as they walk to board the Pequod, a man seeming either crazed or drunk (Royal Dano), and he makes a prophecy, that the day you smell land where there is no land, that day Ahab will meet his death, and after he will return and beckon others save one to follow him. When asked his name, he answers ""Elijah"".The ships second rank officers direct the first part of the voyage while Ahab stays in his quarters. The chief mate is Starbuck, (Leo Genn) a serious, sincere Quaker and fine leader; second mate is Stubb, happy-go-lucky, cheerful and forever smoking his pipe; the third mate is Flask (Seamus Kelly), a thoroughly reliable man who bullies anyone bigger than him. Each mate is responsible for a whaling boat, and each whaling boat of the Pequod has its own pagan harpooneer assigned to it.Some time after sailing, Ahab finally appears on the quarter-deck one morning, an imposing, frightening figure whose haunted visage sends shivers over the narrator. One of his legs is missing from the knee down and has been replaced by a prosthesis fashioned from a whale's jawbone. A long vertical scar from his hairline down to his chin gives his face a special character.Ahab orders the crew to gather, and in a rousing speech promises a Spanish ounce of gold to the crewman who first sights Moby Dick. His single, secret purpose for the voyage is hunting down and killing Moby Dick, an old, very large sperm whale, with a snow white hump and mottled skin, that crippled Ahab on his last whaling voyage. The gold coin is nailed to a mast in plain view as a reminder.In a scene in the Captain's quarters, Ahab explains to Starbuck that over the years he has gathered information on whale presence and migrations from many many whaling ships, and he has fashioned a map that he can use to predict where the whales might be at any time of year. According to his map, Moby Dick should be at Bikini Atoll by the following March.In another sequence, a whale is sighted, pursued in three small boats, and harpooned. The whale swims away towing the boats, and dives. One of the boats might be towed downwards into the deep, so the rope is cut. The whale eventually weakens as it bleeds, and it is killed. The carcass is cut into pieces, the blubber sliced and the oil rendered in large vats on the vessel. At the end of the work, the seamen celebrate.Eventually a day comes when Ishmael is given the opportunity to be the lookout from the top of the main mast. It isnt long before he sights a whale, in fact, a large group of whales. The whales are chased, and five of them are killed. The seamen, who will share in the profits from the value of the oil, are happy.However, Ahab hears from another passing ship that the white whale has been sighted. Immediately he orders a stop to the harvest work, and full sailing in the direction that he believes Moby Dick is traveling, much to the dismay of Stubb and the other seamen, who are shocked that the profit from the whales killed is abandoned.Only Starbuck offers any resistance to the charismatic but obsessed captain. The first mate argues repeatedly that the ships purpose should be to hunt whales for their oil, with luck returning home profitably, safely, and quickly, but not to seek out and kill Moby Dick in particular and especially not for revenge, as revenge is only for the Lord to take.Starbuck even dares to show to the other mates a book in which it is clearly written that if a Captain diverts resources to a private matter and neglects the commercial purpose of the enterprise, the other officers are justified in removing the Captain from his duties. However, Stubb and the other mates refuse to go along with even the planning of such an act. Eventually even Starbuck acquiesces to Ahab's will, suppressing his instincts.The custom of visiting with other whaling vessels met in the open sea is illustrated when the Pequod meets the Samuel Enderby. Captain Boomer (James Robertson Justice) has lost an arm to the whale, comes on board the Pequod for a friendly visit and interchange of news. For Ahab, however, there is but one relevant question to ask of another ship: Hast seen the White Whale? Captain Boomer is stunned at Ahab's burning need for revenge and soon ends their brief interchange.In another incident that emphasizes Ahabs obsession, when a man accidentally falls off the ship from a great height, he is unusually quick in making the decision that the man is dead and will not resurface. Ahab insists on resuming course without delay, to the dismay of Stubb and the seamen.Another day, Queequeg is throwing bone pieces on deck in what is evidently a fortune telling ritual. Suddenly, he stares at his bones, says Ah!, and insists on calling the ships carpenter. He places an order for a very long coffin with special carvings, a coffin that is to be pitched and caulked so as to be waterproof. He pays the carpenter, gives the rest of his money, his harpoon, and other property to Ishmael, and stops talking to anyone while just staring vacantly ahead.Queequeg persists in his catatonic state until much later. When a fight breaks out and Ishmael is in danger of being knifed to death, Queequeg jumps out of his stupor to protect him, and resumes his normal behavior.Next they meet the Rachel, from which Moby Dick has been seen very recently. As a result of the encounter, one of its boats is missing. The captains youngest son had been aboard. The Rachel's captain begs Ahab to aid in the search for the missing boat, but Ahab is resolute; the Pequod is very near the White Whale now and Ahab will not stop to help. He reasons that he will kill the whale that killed the captains son, and revenge should be the priority.The man at the mast sights the white whale, and Captain Ahab organizes a ceremony where the man is handed his Spanish doubloon.In the next sequence the Pequod goes right into a dangerous storm, as the captain refuses to take any course of evasion that would divert him away from Moby Dicks path. Despite extreme danger from strong winds, the captain insists on leaving full canvas on, even trying to replace a torn sail in the middle of the storm. Starbuck begs Ahab one final time to desist on his quest for vengeance, but to no avail. As the ship leaves the storm area, St. Elmos fire appears on the masts, and Captain Ahab shows that he can dominate the elements by his will as he extinguishes the glow from a harpoon he is holding.The next day, the Pequod meets Moby Dick. The Pequod's crew pursues the whale, which wreaks widespread destruction. Ahab ignores Starbucks pleas one more time, and continues with his ill fated chase. All three boats set out to harpoon him.Ahab harpoons the whale, but the harpoon line breaks. Moby Dick then rams the Pequod itself, which is heavily damaged. As Ahab harpoons the whale again, the unfolding harpoon rope catches him and he is entangled with other ropes hanging from harpoons that have remained stuck into Moby Dick from previous encounters.Even stuck to Moby Dick, Ahab stabs and stabs with all his energy trying to kill the whale while it thrashes about, upending the other boats, and diving deep into the sea. After Moby Dick returns to the surface, the crew still on boats see the dead Ahab stuck on the side of the whale, and one limp arm seems to wave, beckoning, even in death, thus fulfilling the mysterious prophecy of Elijah.Moby Dick destroys all boats. As the seamen struggle to stay on the surface, Moby Dick swims around and around the Pequod creating a whirlpool that catches the ship and draws it down slowly.Ishmael is on the surface, still swimming, when Queequegs special coffin bobs up from the deep. Ishmael is able to climb on top of the coffin and cling to it for a day and a half, at which time the Rachel comes upon the scene and he is rescued.Only Ishmael has survived to tell the tale.","
    
                    This classic story by Herman Melville revolves around Captain Ahab and his obsession with a huge whale, Moby Dick. The whale caused the loss of Ahab's leg years before, leaving Ahab to stomp the boards of his ship on a peg leg. Ahab is so crazed by his desire to kill the whale, that he is prepared to sacrifice everything, including his life, the lives of his crew members, and even his ship to find and destroy his nemesis, Moby Dick.

When asked his name, he answers ""Elijah"".The ships second rank officers direct the first part of the voyage while Ahab stays in his quarters. The chief mate is Starbuck, (Leo Genn) a serious, sincere Quaker and fine leader; second mate is Stubb, happy-go-lucky, cheerful and forever smoking his pipe; the third mate is Flask (Seamus Kelly), a thoroughly reliable man who bullies anyone bigger than him. Each mate is responsible for a whaling boat, and each whaling boat of the Pequod has its own pagan harpooneer assigned to it.Some time after sailing, Ahab finally appears on the quarter-deck one morning, an imposing, frightening figure whose haunted visage sends shivers over the narrator. One of his legs is missing from the knee down and has been replaced by a prosthesis fashioned from a whale's jawbone. A long vertical scar from his hairline down to his chin gives his face a special character.Ahab orders the crew to gather, and in a rousing speech promises a Spanish ounce of gold to the crewman who first sights Moby Dick. His single, secret purpose for the voyage is hunting down and killing Moby Dick, an old, very large sperm whale, with a snow white hump and mottled skin, that crippled Ahab on his last whaling voyage. The gold coin is nailed to a mast in plain view as a reminder.In a scene in the Captain's quarters, Ahab explains to Starbuck that over the years he has gathered information on whale presence and migrations from many many whaling ships, and he has fashioned a map that he can use to predict where the whales might be at any time of year. According to his map, Moby Dick should be at Bikini Atoll by the following March.In another sequence, a whale is sighted, pursued in three small boats, and harpooned. The whale swims away towing the boats, and dives. One of the boats might be towed downwards into the deep, so the rope is cut. The whale eventually weakens as it bleeds, and it is killed. The carcass is cut into pieces, the blubber sliced and the oil rendered in large vats on the vessel. At the end of the work, the seamen celebrate.Eventually a day comes when Ishmael is given the opportunity to be the lookout from the top of the main mast. It isnt long before he sights a whale, in fact, a large group of whales. The whales are chased, and five of them are killed. The seamen, who will share in the profits from the value of the oil, are happy.However, Ahab hears from another passing ship that the white whale has been sighted. Immediately he orders a stop to the harvest work, and full sailing in the direction that he believes Moby Dick is traveling, much to the dismay of Stubb and the other seamen, who are shocked that the profit from the whales killed is abandoned.Only Starbuck offers any resistance to the charismatic but obsessed captain. The first mate argues repeatedly that the ships purpose should be to hunt whales for their oil, with luck returning home profitably, safely, and quickly, but not to seek out and kill Moby Dick in particular and especially not for revenge, as revenge is only for the Lord to take.Starbuck even dares to show to the other mates a book in which it is clearly written that if a Captain diverts resources to a private matter and neglects the commercial purpose of the enterprise, the other officers are justified in removing the Captain from his duties. However, Stubb and the other mates refuse to go along with even the planning of such an act. Eventually even Starbuck acquiesces to Ahab's will, suppressing his instincts.The custom of visiting with other whaling vessels met in the open sea is illustrated when the Pequod meets the Samuel Enderby. Captain Boomer (James Robertson Justice) has lost an arm to the whale, comes on board the Pequod for a friendly visit and interchange of news. For Ahab, however, there is but one relevant question to ask of another ship: Hast seen the White Whale? Captain Boomer is stunned at Ahab's burning need for revenge and soon ends their brief interchange.In another incident that emphasizes Ahabs obsession, when a man accidentally falls off the ship from a great height, he is unusually quick in making the decision that the man is dead and will not resurface. Ahab insists on resuming course without delay, to the dismay of Stubb and the seamen.Another day, Queequeg is throwing bone pieces on deck in what is evidently a fortune telling ritual. Suddenly, he stares at his bones, says Ah!, and insists on calling the ships carpenter. He places an order for a very long coffin with special carvings, a coffin that is to be pitched and caulked so as to be waterproof. He pays the carpenter, gives the rest of his money, his harpoon, and other property to Ishmael, and stops talking to anyone while just staring vacantly ahead.Queequeg persists in his catatonic state until much later. When a fight breaks out and Ishmael is in danger of being knifed to death, Queequeg jumps out of his stupor to protect him, and resumes his normal behavior.Next they meet the Rachel, from which Moby Dick has been seen very recently. As a result of the encounter, one of its boats is missing. The captains youngest son had been aboard. The Rachel's captain begs Ahab to aid in the search for the missing boat, but Ahab is resolute; the Pequod is very near the White Whale now and Ahab will not stop to help. He reasons that he will kill the whale that killed the captains son, and revenge should be the priority.The man at the mast sights the white whale, and Captain Ahab organizes a ceremony where the man is handed his Spanish doubloon.In the next sequence the Pequod goes right into a dangerous storm, as the captain refuses to take any course of evasion that would divert him away from Moby Dicks path. Despite extreme danger from strong winds, the captain insists on leaving full canvas on, even trying to replace a torn sail in the middle of the storm. Starbuck begs Ahab one final time to desist on his quest for vengeance, but to no avail. As the ship leaves the storm area, St. Elmos fire appears on the masts, and Captain Ahab shows that he can dominate the elements by his will as he extinguishes the glow from a harpoon he is holding.The next day, the Pequod meets Moby Dick. The Pequod's crew pursues the whale, which wreaks widespread destruction. Ahab ignores Starbucks pleas one more time, and continues with his ill fated chase. All three boats set out to harpoon him.Ahab harpoons the whale, but the harpoon line breaks. Moby Dick then rams the Pequod itself, which is heavily damaged. As Ahab harpoons the whale again, the unfolding harpoon rope catches him and he is entangled with other ropes hanging from harpoons that have remained stuck into Moby Dick from previous encounters.Even stuck to Moby Dick, Ahab stabs and stabs with all his energy trying to kill the whale while it thrashes about, upending the other boats, and diving deep into the sea. After Moby Dick returns to the surface, the crew still on boats see the dead Ahab stuck on the side of the whale, and one limp arm seems to wave, beckoning, even in death, thus fulfilling the mysterious prophecy of Elijah.Moby Dick destroys all boats. As the seamen struggle to stay on the surface, Moby Dick swims around and around the Pequod creating a whirlpool that catches the ship and draws it down slowly.Ishmael is on the surface, still swimming, when Queequegs special coffin bobs up from the deep. Ishmael is able to climb on top of the coffin and cling to it for a day and a half, at which time the Rachel comes upon the scene and he is rescued.Only Ishmael has survived to tell the tale.

                    When this movie is made in 1956, one can circumnavigate the globe in a little less than two days. When Jules Verne wrote the story ""Around the World in Eighty Days"" in 1872, he predicted that one day man could accomplish the task in eighty hours, but which most considered folly to do in eighty days in current times... that is except for people like Englishman Phileas Fogg, a regimented man who believed all it would take is exacting work, the skills he possesses. He just has to make sure a train's schedule meets the required sailing schedule which meets the required coach schedule and so on. As such, he takes up what ends up being the highly publicized £20,000 wager from his fellow members at the London Reform Club to do so, losing the bet which would ruin him financially. Along for the ride is Fogg's new, loyal and devoted valet, the recently arrived Latin immigrant, Passepartout, who possesses unusual skills which could be major assets, but whose all consuming thoughts on the opposite sex could take away his focus from the task at hand. Although Fogg has accounted for certain transportation delays, he may not account for cultural peccadilloes he may encounter along the way which could also cause delays. He is also unaware of the true reason a man name Fix is following them, he who could also derail Fogg's task permanently. As Fogg and Passepartout proceed on their journey, they get into one misadventure after another. Ultimately, Fogg may find other things in life more important than winning the bet.

As Beau has had no experience with women being isolated on the ranch, this trip only being the second time in his life that he has stepped foot off the ranch, Virgil believes this trip may be a good time for Beau to start thinking about women with the eventual goal of finding a wife. Virgil's idea of such a wife for Beau is a girl like Elma Duckworth, a young next-door type who boards the bus at Grace's Diner in southern Utah. But Beau, who wants to marry an ""angel"" and will know that angel when he sees her, immediately believes that that woman is Chérie, the performer at the Blue Dragon Café in Phoenix, she who also hustles for drinks from the customers on her boss' directive. Chérie, from River Gulch, Arkansas, decided to hit the road with no goal or destination in mind, and along the way figured her destiny was to be a Hollywood star. Beyond her beauty, Chérie is talentless and uneducated, even to the ways of the world, even though her outward appearance makes her look experienced. She has often been taken advantage of. Socially unaware and direct Beau, who figures he has no time to court, does whatever he needs to to get Chérie to go with him back to Montana as his wife after the rodeo has concluded, wanting to look experienced with women in the process. He ends up being single-minded in his pursuit of her. Despite being physically attracted to him, Chérie may have other things on her mind than marriage to a bully of a Montana cowboy.

"18","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051207/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","As is his custom, Christopher Emanuel ""Manny"" Balestrero, a string bass player at New York City's Stork Club, returns home to Jackson Heights after the club closes just before dawn. His wife Rose is still awake, suffering from a toothache, and confides her anxiety about their inability to pay for having her tooth extracted. The couple, who are rearing two young boys, live frugally and have weathered their share of financial distresses. Remembering Rose's insurance policy, Manny suggests that they can borrow against it to pay for the procedure and plans to look into it when the office opens.Later, after promising to return at 5:30 to give music lessons to his sons, Manny visits his ailing father and then goes to the insurance company to see about the loan. Although he does not notice, the clerks become nervous in his presence and decide among themselves that he looks like the man who robbed them a month ago. The police, alerted by the insurance clerks, wait outside Manny's home and pick him up on his doorstep at 5:30. Without allowing him first to speak to his wife and without telling him why he is being taken into custody, they drive him to the station.There, after asking the bewildered Manny about his finances, the police conclude that he has a motive to steal money. They drive him to several stores that have been robbed in the past and ask the proprietors if he is the man who robbed them. When many of the victims express uncertainty about Manny being the thief, the police summon the insurance clerks to the station to identify him. To determine if his handwriting matches that of the robber, one of the detectives reads aloud a printed holdup note and asks Manny to print the words on a scrap of paper. Because Manny's printing is similar to the robber's, they ask him to print out a second sample. The second time, Manny, who has become increasingly frightened, misspells the word ""drawer"" as ""draw,"" which, coincidentally, is the same way the robber spelled the word. Based on this mistake and the tentative word of the witnesses, Manny is booked on charges of assault and robbery, fingerprinted and put in a cell for the night.Meanwhile, Rose, whom Manny has never been allowed to contact, worries that he has been in an accident, as he has never been late without calling. By the time the police notify Rose, Manny's mother and sister and brother-in-law, Gene and Olga Conforti, are waiting with her. The next morning, Manny is taken to the felony court in a police wagon with suspects of other crimes. A trial date is set, but despite his appointed attorney's request for leniency, the judge sets the bail at $7,500 and Manny is taken to the Queens County jail. After the Confortis manage to raise the money for Manny's bail, Rose calls lawyer Frank D. O'Connor, who has been recommended to Manny's mother.Although O'Connor warns that he has little experience with criminal cases, he takes the case, and urges Manny to recall where he was on the dates of the alleged robberies. On the date of the first robbery five months ago, the Balestreros recall that they were on vacation at a resort in Cornwall, New York, and at the time in question, Manny was playing cards with three other vacationers. Rose and Manny try to track down the three men, whose names they get from the resort owners, but one, a boxer, is never found and the two other men have died.Manny remembers that at the time of the second robbery he was suffering from a toothache, and his dentist confirms that his jaw was so swollen that dental work had to be postponed. O'Connor believes this might provide an alibi in court, as none of the witnesses reported that the robber had a swollen jaw. Rose becomes increasingly depressed, and begins to blame herself for Manny's problems, illogically concluding that it was because of her that Manny went to the insurance office to ask for a loan. When her behavior deteriorates into paranoia, Manny takes her to a doctor, who admits her to a sanitarium in Ossining.As Manny's trial begins, the witnesses are called to the stand to identify Manny as the robber. The incompetent O'Connor does very little to try to discredit or argue with the testimony. During O'Connor's half-hearted cross-examination of one witness , one of the jurors, who has already made up his mind about the case, asks the judge if they ""have to sit and listen to this?"" After a brief conference with O'Connor and the district attorney, the judge calls a mistrial after seeing the that majority of the jurors are bias against Manny and have concluded that he is the robber. O'Connor tells Manny that they will have to start over.Afterward, at home, Manny talks to his mother, who is taking care of the boys during Rose's absence, about his feeling of despair and she advises him to pray. Soon after, a man holds up a delicatessen. The owner signals to her husband, who approaches the robber from behind and holds him, while she phones the police. The robber is arrested and brought into the police station, where, in the hallway, he passes a detective working on Manny's case. Although the robber makes no initial impression on the detective, his resemblance to Manny soon strikes the latter, who follows up his hunch.Later, while performing at the Stork Club, Manny is summoned to the 110th precinct police station. When Manny arrives, the insurance clerks are there confirming that the robber is the same person who held them up. After identifying the correct man, they cannot meet Manny's eyes as they leave.

                    Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero - Manny to his friends - is a string bassist, a devoted husband and father, and a practicing Catholic. His $85 a week gig playing in the jazz combo at the Stork Club is barely enough to make ends meet. The Balestreros' lives will become a little more difficult with the major dental bills his wife Rose will be incurring. As such, Manny decides to see if he can borrow off of Rose's life insurance policy. But when he enters the insurance office, he is identified by some of the clerks as the man that held up the office twice a few months earlier. Manny cooperates with the police as he has nothing to hide. Manny learns that he is a suspect in not only those hold ups, but a series of other hold ups in the same Jackson Heights neighborhood in New York City where they live. The more that Manny cooperates, the more guilty he appears to the police. With the help of Frank O'Connor, the attorney that they hire, they try to prove Manny's innocence. Regardless of if they manage to prove Manny's innocence or find the actual hold-up man, the situation may cause irreparable damage on the Balestreros.

    Synopsis
    As is his custom, Christopher Emanuel ""Manny"" Balestrero, a string bass player at New York City's Stork Club, returns home to Jackson Heights after the club closes just before dawn. His wife Rose is still awake, suffering from a toothache, and confides her anxiety about their inability to pay for having her tooth extracted. The couple, who are rearing two young boys, live frugally and have weathered their share of financial distresses. Remembering Rose's insurance policy, Manny suggests that they can borrow against it to pay for the procedure and plans to look into it when the office opens.Later, after promising to return at 5:30 to give music lessons to his sons, Manny visits his ailing father and then goes to the insurance company to see about the loan. Although he does not notice, the clerks become nervous in his presence and decide among themselves that he looks like the man who robbed them a month ago. The police, alerted by the insurance clerks, wait outside Manny's home and pick him up on his doorstep at 5:30. Without allowing him first to speak to his wife and without telling him why he is being taken into custody, they drive him to the station.There, after asking the bewildered Manny about his finances, the police conclude that he has a motive to steal money. They drive him to several stores that have been robbed in the past and ask the proprietors if he is the man who robbed them. When many of the victims express uncertainty about Manny being the thief, the police summon the insurance clerks to the station to identify him. To determine if his handwriting matches that of the robber, one of the detectives reads aloud a printed holdup note and asks Manny to print the words on a scrap of paper. Because Manny's printing is similar to the robber's, they ask him to print out a second sample. The second time, Manny, who has become increasingly frightened, misspells the word ""drawer"" as ""draw,"" which, coincidentally, is the same way the robber spelled the word. Based on this mistake and the tentative word of the witnesses, Manny is booked on charges of assault and robbery, fingerprinted and put in a cell for the night.Meanwhile, Rose, whom Manny has never been allowed to contact, worries that he has been in an accident, as he has never been late without calling.

A man named Fontaine, who worked for the French Resistance, is captured by the Nazis and held captive in a prison along with a multitude of other men and women the Nazis charge have or are plotting against them. None know what their fates will be, although they can hear executions by firing squad on site from their prison cells. When Fontaine settles into the second cell in which he is housed in the prison, he finds an opportunity possibly to find a way out of his cell without his captors knowing. From that starting point and a spoon he secretly keeps as his only tool, Fontaine decides that he will see if that escape from the cell, which will take meticulous planning and great patience in and of itself, can lead to an escape from the prison itself. Not knowing anyone in the prison before his arrival, he has to decide who he can and cannot trust, as he may have to have the cooperation of others along the way. Because this work to escape his cell may be specific to this one and only cell, his work, to be successful, is dependent on his cell not being checked, and for his day to day life being the same. A breach to this routine takes place just as he thinks he may have all the tools ready to make a legitimate escape attempt. He will have to make a decision on how to deal with this breach, one that he cannot take lightly due to the situation, for the plan even remotely to have a chance of success, which if it doesn't means certain death.

                    1928. Despite the official records stating that all of Russian Tsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexandra's children were executed along with them in 1918 during the revolution, rumors have abounded that the youngest daughter, the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna, managed to escape and is thus still alive. As such, a £10 million inheritance has been kept for her in the Bank of England. With this fact in mind, Sergei Bounine, a former Russian general in the Tsar's army and now a Parisian restaurateur, and two of his Russian associates, Boris Chernov and Piotr Petrovin, have long hatched a plan to access that money: find a young woman to impersonate Anastasia. Bounine thinks he's found the perfect woman when another of his associates spots someone on the streets of Paris who has more than a passing resemblance to what most people probably believe Anastasia would look like. She also has some remarkable characteristics similar to Anastasia. The issue with this woman is that she is an amnesiac, and is despondent over that fact. She is a willing participant more so truly to discover who she is, Anastasia or not. In that alternate life so that she can move around easily, they rechristen her Anna Koreff. In accessing that £10 million, they will have not only to convince Prince Paul von Haraldberg, who was once engaged to Anastasia, but more importantly Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress, who has had many an ""Anastasia"" paraded in front of her in the intervening ten years. As Bounine and Anna progress with transforming her into Anastasia for the world to see, they may come to reach different motivations than the ones they began with.

                    In Tiger Tail County, Mississippi, the decadent middle aged Archie Lee Meighan has been married with the spoiled and stupid Baby Doll Meighan for two years and has not consummated his marriage yet. Archie has promised to his father-in-law in the death bed to wait until Baby Doll is twenty years old to have sex with her and they live in a dilapidated mansion with Baby Doll's aunt. When the Sicilian Silva Vacarro brings a new cotton-spinning machine to the county, Archie loses his business and is completely broken. On the eve of Baby Doll's twentieth birthday, Archie Lee burns down Vacarro's machine. The Sicilian suspects that Archie is the responsible for the criminal fire and he heads to Archie's property to use his old machine. While Archie is buying a cylinder to replace a damaged one in the machine, Vacarro seduces the despicable Baby Doll and forces her to sign a confession that Archie has burnt his equipment. When Archie returns home, he gets crazy with the situation.

    Synopsis
    Archie Lee Meighan (Karl Malden), a middle aged cotton gin owner, lives with his teen bride, Baby Doll (Carroll Baker) and her eccentric Aunt Rose Comfort (Mildred Dunnock) in a dilapidated plantation house in Tiger's Tail County, Mississippi. Archie Lee and Baby Doll have yet to consummate their marriage; they have separate bed rooms, with Baby Doll sleeping in an oversized crib in hers. Archie Lee desperately wants to but Baby Doll keeps him at arm's length. But on her 20th birthday -- one day away -- Baby Doll has promised to give her virginity to Archie Lee. She and Archie Lee fight a lot, and she threatens to leave him and live in a hotel in town if he doesn't provide for her. The situation boils over when the furniture company repossesses their furniture.Archie Lee's business is in terrible straits. All of the cotton fields are now working with the Syndicate Gin run by a Sicilian, Silva Vaccaro (Eli Wallach). Vaccaro has put many local business owners out of work with his large operation. One night, during a party in honor of the Syndicate Gin, Archie Lee burns the gin house to the ground. When the local authorities refuse to pursue an investigation because Vaccaro is an outsider, Vaccaro vows to take matters into his own hands. He realizes that Archie Lee was the only person not at the party and determines to prove his guilt.The next day Vaccaro takes his cotton to Archie Lee to have it ginned. While Archie Lee tries to get his antiquated machinery working, Vaccaro flirts with Baby Doll. She lets slip that, contrary to what he had told Vaccaro a few minutes earlier, Archie Lee was not at home at the time of the fire. Becoming suspicious of Vaccaro's intentions, Baby Doll goes to Archie Lee for protection. But he is upset because his gin has broken down. Vaccaro demands that Archie Lee go wherever he has to to find a replacement part. Archie Lee agrees and immediately leaves. Vaccaro sends an associate to get the replacement out of Vaccaro's own storehouse then continues to pursue Baby Doll.Baby Doll believes the plantation house is haunted. Vaccaro playfully uses this to ""scare"" Baby Doll and eventually get her to lower her guard. They play hide and seek, and Baby Doll hides in the attic. The floorboards are dangerously loose. Vaccaro, now forceful and angry, tells Baby Doll that she can't come out of the attic until she agrees to sign his handwritten ""affidavit"" that Archie Lee burned down the gin house. Baby Doll signs it. Vaccaro lets her out and prepares to leave. But Baby Doll persuades him to stay and take a nap with her in the crib, one of the few pieces of furniture left in the house.Archie Lee returns with the part and is angered and embarrassed to discover that Vaccaro has begun to take over his business. These emotions are only amplified when he discovers Baby Doll lounging around the house with Vaccaro, he still curled up in that oversized crib, she clad only in her slip. Baby Doll suggests that Vaccaro is interested in becoming partners with Archie Lee and suggests they discuss it over dinner. When Archie Lee sneaks away to make a phone call to friends in hopes they will come over to he house and help him deal with Vaccaro, Baby Doll kisses Vaccaro. Over dinner, she and Vaccaro taunt Archie Lee about his poor luck and flirt openly. When Archie Lee tries to take his anger out on Aunt Rose by threatening to evict her from the house, Vaccaro offers to hire her as his cook.Humiliated, Archie Lee loads his shotgun to kill Vaccaro. While Baby Doll calls the police, Vaccaro hides in a tree. Drunk, Archie Lee wanders the house and front yard looking for Vaccaro but can't find him. When the police arrive, they disarm Archie Lee; when Vaccaro shows them the affidavit signed by Baby Doll, they arrest Archie Lee as well. Baby Doll hopes Vaccaro will stay with her but he is more interested in ensuring his cotton is processed and goes home. Resigned, Baby Doll leads Aunt Rose back into the plantation house, telling her they will have to see what tomorrow brings.

                    Billy Bigelow has been dead for fifteen years, and now outside the pearly gates, he long waived his right to go back to Earth for a day. But he has heard that there is a problem with his family, namely his wife Julie Bigelow née Jordan and the child he never met, that problem with which he would now like to head back to Earth to assist in rectifying. Before he is allowed back to Earth, he has to get the OK from the gatekeeper, to who he tells his story... Immediately attracted to each other, he and Julie met when he worked as a carousel barker. Both stated to the other that they did not believe in love or marriage, but they did get married. Because the shrewish carousel owner, Mrs. Mullin, was attracted to Billy herself, and since she believed he was only of use as a barker if he was single to attract the young women to the carousel, she fired him. With no other job skills and unwilling to take just any job, Billy did not provide for Julie but rather lived off Julie's Aunt Nettie. But Billy figured he could be the breadwinner through his association with a criminal lowlife named Jigger Craigin, which led to his death. In going back to Earth, Billy not only hopes to help his child, but ""tell"" Julie of his true feeling for her.

Orsini convinces him to act as his catcher and all is well until the gold digging Lola, who'll do just about anything to become part of a major circus act, arrives on the scene.

They also preach non-violence and remain neutral as far as the war and fighting goes. They are against slavery but don't feel men should be killed over the issue. Their eldest daughter Mattie is sweet on Gard Jordan who is now a Union Lieutenant but they think no less of him for that. Their peaceful coexistence with the war is tested, along with their faith and their beliefs, when a Confederate army threatens their area.

                    1862. Jess and Eliza Birdwell and their three offspring - young adults Josh and Mattie and adolescent Little Jess - are a loving, supportive Quaker farming family (Jess a nurseryman) living in Southern Indiana. Especially as Eliza is a minister, they live to their Quaker beliefs, one of the largest day-to-day issues being avoiding falling into temptation that surrounds them in general society, each member of the family and of their Quaker community facing his or her own temptations. These temptations include, for Jess, stroking his own ego in wanting a horse faster than that belonging to neighbor and friend Sam Jordan, a Methodist, solely to beat Sam in less than impromptu road races in going to their respective Sunday religious services, and, for Mattie, doing whatever to look more holistically attractive to Sam's son, Gard Jordan, a Union soldier, who is unofficially courting her. Because of their pacifism, the Quaker community has not encouraged their own to fight in the war, their belief not to bear arms against their fellow man stronger than their belief in the freedom for slaves. The slavery issue hits home for the Birdwells as their farmhand, Enoch, is a runaway slave. Some in the general population accuse the Quakers of hiding behind religion in order not to fight for the real reason of fear. Josh, a young man of prime fighting age, admits he does not fight as he doesn't believe in violence. Although some men in the Quaker community speak their own mind about fighting if it comes to protecting one's own family and their community in general - some truly not knowing if their belief matches reality - those words and beliefs will be tested as the rebel Confederate forces approach the area. The entire issue has the potential to figuratively tear apart the Birdwells if their beliefs and actions differ among the individual family members, each who is directly affected in different ways.

Among jugglers and other entertainers, Esmeralda, a sensuous gypsy, performs a bewitching dance in front of delighted spectators. From up in a tower of the cathedral, Frollo, an alchemist, gazes at her lustfully. Later in the night, Frollo orders Quasimodo, the deformed bell ringer and his faithful servant, to kidnap Esmeralda.

Marcia Barton (Leigh Snowden) is driving with her husband, Dr. William Barton (Jeff Morrow) in the passenger seat. They pull up to the Yacht Basin in Ft. Myers, Florida and board the 102 foot Yacht, Vagabondia III. She exits the vehicle leaving Barton in the car. She is met by Dr. Thomas Morgan (Rex Reason) and introduced to the guide, Jed Grant (Gregg Palmer) and Dr. Borg (Maurice Manson). Dr. Barton finally comes on board. The ship's captain, Stanley (David McMahon) arrives in the cabin and inquires as to departure. The three scientists walk to the lab and greet Dr. Johnson (James Rawley). They check on equipment and discuss the capture of the creature in the Everglades. Dr. Johnson explains the finer aspects of his fish finder, but the scientists are distracted by gunshots up on deck. They go to investigate. Marcia is shooting at a couple of sharks. Her husband disarms her then goes below. Grant stays behind to talk to Mrs. Barton. They drop anchor and head for shore in a motorboat. The four scientists and Grant pay a call on Morteno (Paul Fierro) and his wife (Lillian Molieri). A badly scarred man, Morteno, thanks Grant for the food and money. Morteno was attacked by the creature and tells Barton the story. Morteno makes his living in the Everglades hunting alligators for their skins when the creature attacked. Dr. Johnson asks to examine the knife. The red blood corpuscle count matches the Ocean Harbor figures for the creature. Barton concludes that the blood characteristics are such that, ""We can make the giant step, and bring a new species into existence."" Dr. Morgan voices his opposition to Barton's plan, ""But Doctor, there's no short cut. You can't bypass nature."" When Barton threatens to return all the scientists back and start with a new group they agree to stay, even Dr. Morgan.Grant and Morgan suit up and put on their scuba equipment for an underwater test. Marcia decides to join the men over objections from both Morgan and her husband. Grant assures Barton he will look after Marcia. The three enter the water from the Yacht. Borg, Johnson, and Barton go below to observe on the sonar. They are in radio contact with Morgan. They are slightly below 50 feet and pass schools of fish. A fourth object appears, but it is only a tarpon. They swim deeper when the creature (an uncredited Ricou Browning) appears. The divers don't see him yet, but Borg sees something on the sonar, and warns the divers it is shadowing them. The two men are testing the equipment and don't notice Marcia is no longer with them. She is behaving strangely and has removed both her swim fins. She is in trouble and pushes out her breathing mouth piece. Morgan takes her to the surface. The two men carry her on board. Barton is unhappy with Grant until he is informed that they found the creature. Morgan and Marcia begin to talk about why she takes chances and endangers her own life. She begins to tell Morgan about her life when they are interrupted by the steward (Frank Chase) who announces he must prepare the cabin for dinner. She returns to her cabin. Her husband is waiting and jealous. He reminds her, ""You're my wife, Marcia. Conduct yourself that way. Don't ever try to leave me. Don't ever try to make a fool of me.""They weigh anchor and follow the creature using the sonar. It is early evening and they are working their way up stream into more shallow water. The creature is now astern and Morgan suggests they increase speed. They suspect the creature is leading them into a trap. When the water gets too shallow Capt. Stanley orders the anchor dropped. Grant and the four scientists board the launch and go in search of their prey. They carry the sonar and plenty of rotenone to stun the creature. They venture deeper and deeper into the lagoon. While Borg tracks his progress on sonar, Grant searches the water with a spotlight. They hear splashing and the creature launches out of the water and attacks the spotlight on the bow of the boat. They light gasoline torches and place them on the bow and stern. The creature attacks again, this time he jumps up on the stern of the small boat. Grant hits him with a spear, but the creature pulls it out. Grant gets him with another spear while the creature pours gasoline over itself. A well-aimed throw of one of the torches causes the creature to be engulfed in fire. He falls back into the water. The creature pushes the boat up and all aboard go into the shallow water. The creature tries to move a log, but collapses. Drs. Barton and Morgan carefully approach the fallen beast. Barton examines the creature and pronounces, ""The drug knocked him out, all right."" Morgan observes, ""If it hadn't the fire would've. These are third-degree burns."" They carry the creature back to the boat.On an operating room table aboard the yacht, the creature (an uncredited Don Megowan) is heavily bandaged covering his burns. Barton observes, ""He isn't converting enough air into oxygen. The fire severely damaged his gills and he is dying of suffocation."" Borg enters the room and puts up X-rays. They notice that the creature has lungs and speculate he may be able to breathe on land like lung fish. They do a tracheotomy immediately and Barton states, ""We are changing a sea creature into a land creature."" Borg does some tests that indicate there may be some brain damage. The creature seems to revive and breaks the restraints holding his arms to the gurney. They examine the creature's eyes.With their creature somewhat settled, Barton sends a wire to his ranch in Sausalito, California to have things ready for his arrival. They will take the Panama Canal and will arrive August 20th. They are under way. Marcia wants to see the creature but Dr. Johnson tells Mrs. Barton her husband says no. Marcia leaves, but encounters Grant in the passageway. He makes a play for her, but she brushes him off. The four scientists remove the bandages from the creature. They notice changes in the skin. The hand is more humanlike, less webbed. They remove the bandages from around the head. It has also undergone a transformation, ""The fire burned away the out scale. There's a structure of human skin underneath it: two separate coverings, the way he had lungs and gills,"" Barton proudly announces. The creature looks first at Morgan, then turns his head to stare at Barton.Morgan and Barton decide to celebrate, but first ask Grant to make the creature some clothing out of sail cloth. Mrs. Barton and the scientists celebrate with liquor. Barton and Morgan discuss genetics and the creature. Morgan again reiterates his concern over their work. Morgan leaves the cabin to check on the creature. A very drunk Barton asks Johnson and Borg if they agree with Dr. Morgan. Both are non-committal and excuse themselves. This leaves husband and wife alone to chat, but it ends badly and Marcia spends the night in the main salon instead of her cabin with her husband. Grant takes this as an invitation to try his luck with the lady again. The creature pops the lock on his cabin door and goes for a stroll down the passageway. He hears Grant and Marcia and goes to investigate. Marcia is trying to fight off Grant's unwanted advances when the creature enters. He attacks Grant then heads for deck. He jumps into the ocean, but with damaged gills he will drown underwater. Morgan grabs an air hose and dives in to rescue the creature. Morgan finds the creature and they struggle, but eventually it takes the air from the hose. Morgan hauls the creature back to the surface, periodically feeding it air from the hose.A large truck arrives at the ranch. It is followed by a car. Armed ranch hands greet the vehicles. Grant opens the truck. The creature, wearing his canvas clothes, walks down the ramp and enters his caged enclosure. He scares some sheep that share his pen. Barton throws the switch on an electrified fence. That evening the creature just stands in his enclosure and stares at the water. Morgan observes the creature, and overhears Barton and his wife argue. Barton joins Morgan to observe the creature through a two-way mirror. Barton is happy and notes the creature is becoming more human every day. The discussion turns obliquely to Barton's marriage and behavior. Morgan confides in Marcia how concerned he is with her husband. He admits he thinks Barton is disturbed, ""Your husband needs help."" Marcia goes for an evening swim. Grant appears in a bathrobe carrying a towel. Grant dives into the water, over her objections to his company. A mountain lion appears attracted to the sheep. It climbs a tree and gains entry to the enclosure. The creature attacks and kills the cat. The commotion draws the attention of the scientists. Barton observes his wife with Grant. Later that evening, Barton stews and frets over the increasing realization that his wife and Grant are too close. Barton confronts his rival and orders, ""Get up. Pack your clothes and get out!"" Grant agrees but only if he can spend the night, but Barton insists that it be now, tonight. Barton pays him his wages in cash. Grant packs and walks away, but can't resist taunting Barton about his wife. Barton, enraged and jealous, repeatedly strikes Grant on the head with the butt end of his revolver. Barton realizes he's killed Grant in a fit of rage. He decides to put the body in the creature's enclosure so he can blame the creature for the man's death. The enraged creature tears the door off his enclosure and chases Barton back into the house. It trashes the room and searches for Barton. It encounters a hysterical Marcia and Morgan. It spots Barton making a break for it outside and gives chase. It catches Barton and throws him off the second floor balcony to his death. The creature calmly walks down the outdoor stairway and destroys his enclosure and walks away.Some days later the remaining scientists, in the living room of the house, wax philosophical about the creature. Mrs. Barton descends the stairs well dressed, and carrying a suitcase. Other suitcases are stacked up at the bottom of the staircase. She thanks the scientists for their help.

Stride is tormented by the fact that his own failure to keep his job was the cause of his wife's working in the express office and thus he is partly responsible for her death. Stride encounters a married couple heading west for California and helps them. Along the way they are joined by two n'er-do-wells, Masters and Clete, who know that Stride is after the express-office robbers. They plan to let Stride lead them to the bandits, then make away with the loot themselves. But they aren't the only ones carrying a secret.

    Synopsis
    A lone cowboy, Ben Stride (Randolph Scott) in the driving rain walks into a camp where two men sit around a fire. He complains that his horse was eaten by Chirakawa Indians as he recounts the story of a robbery of a Wells Fargo station and a killing by seven gunmen back in Silver Springs where he was sheriff. When one of the two men asks if he has found any of the culprits Stride looks at them and says that he has found two as he immediately dispatches the cowboys. As Stride continues to track down the other men responsible for the robbery and killing, he encounters John Greer (Walter Reed) and his wife in a wagon heading for Flora Vista where the criminals are believed to have fled. Stride helps the couple out and accompanies them for a while when they encounter Bill Master (Lee Marvin) and his partner who are aware of the robbery and killing, and it comes out that it was Stride's wife who was killed by the criminals. Master is not one of the criminals Strides seeks but someone who has been jailed by Stride in the past and the former sheriff views him suspiciously. It becomes clear that as they group approaches their destination Stride will have to have to shoot it out with the bad men who have killed his wife, and Master, although not responsible for any crime thus far states clearly to Stride that he intends to obtain the Wells Fargo money for himself but as they near Flora Vista where the crooks are holed up an interesting detail comes out that links John Greer and his wife to Strides fate.

Basil Rathbone tells us, ""The ancients who wrote in the sensory tongue made first mention of the strange drug they called Nind Andhera. This drug was first introduced into the city of Lahore in the Punjab in the 703rd year after the death of the Prophet, praise his memory. This drug has the power to place a mans body and limbs into helplessness and his soul sleeps. Nor does he feel pain. He is as a dead man, yet he is not of the dead."" Title and credits follow.A wide shot of Newgate Prison in London in the year 1872 is followed by two guards and Sir Joel Cadman (Basil Rathbone) going to see a prisoner. Dr. Gordon Angus Ramsay (Herbert Rudley) is a condemned man, scheduled to hang the next morning. Cadman was his medical school teacher. Ramsay is chained to the wall. He complains that he was convicted on circumstantial evidence of killing a man named Curry. Ramsay does admit to some of the facts, but does not remember most of what occurred. Most distressing to Ramsay is the fact that after being hanged his body is to be delivered to a medical school for dissection, instead of a proper burial. Cadman assures his student that will not happen. He has interceded with the Lord Chief Justice to get that provision of his sentence rescinded. Cadman is to get Ramsay's body and will be buried properly. Cadman pops the top on his walking stick and pours a small amount of powder into a cup. He instructs Ramsay to take a drink in the morning before the guards come for him. He explains it is only a sedative to help him cope with the ordeal. The next morning in his cell, while the crowd outside gets restless, three men stand next to the dead body of Ramsay. The prison doctor pronounces time of death at approximately 5:00 a.m.Odo the Gypsy (Akim Tamiroff) escorts Dr. Cadman to a room containing a coffin containing the body of Dr. Ramsay. Cadman prepares a syringe and inject the antidote into the arm of Ramsay, which shows signs of rigor mortis. Cadman and Odo hold the body down. Ramsay begins to revive, his body racked with spasms and labored breathing. Cadman informs his student, ""You're dead Dr. Ramsay."" He then reads the Death Certificate to Ramsay. Odo and Cadman lift Ramsay out of the coffin. Cadman reveals that the antidote must be administered within twelve hours or death occurs, and his reason for the rescue from the hangman. Cadman objects to state sponsored murder and that he needs the help of a skilled surgeon. Ramsay voices his appreciation.At St. Griffins, an old abbey on the east coast of England, Cadman and Ramsay arrive by carriage. Casimir (Bela Lugosi) answers the door and takes their hats and coats. An immediate commotion ensues. Laurie Monroe (Patricia Blair as Patricia Blake) runs screaming to Dr. Cadman followed her tormentor, Mungo (Lon Chaney) formerly Dr. Monroe. Mungo approaches dragging one foot and is unresponsive to Dr. Cadman's orders to stop. Mungo pushes aside the two medical men and attacks Laurie. Daphne (Phyllis Stanley), Cadman's nurse appears. She is the only person who has any influence over Mungo. Mungo releases Laurie and takes Daphne's hand then limps away. Cadman escorts Ramsay to his room. Daphne tends to the comatose body of Cadman's wife, Angelina (an uncredited Louanna Gardner). She brushes her hair and takes her temperature. Cadman enters and is briefed on his wife's condition. Cadman tells his nurse he must operate soon. He plans brain surgery to cure the paralysis and coma.The next morning the two medical men have breakfast and discuss the Mungo mishap. Ramsay thinks Mungo looks familiar and is informed that Mungo was a lecturer at the medical college, Dr. Monroe. He suffered a brain disease and Cadman promises to cure him. Cadman then shows Ramsay a diagram of the brain and explains the areas and their functions. The full nature of Ramsay's task is explained, ""The work is too complex for one man. You, doctor, you shall help me complete my chart."" Cadman leads Ramsay through a door at the back of a large, open, fireplace. The secret door leads to an old part of the abbey tower Cadman now uses for his surgery. Daphne and Laurie are already present and preparing a cadaver for surgery. Cadman and Ramsay wash their hands while Daphne finishes shaving the head of K6, a sailor (George Sawaya). Ramsay is under the impression that the sailor is a cadaver, but will soon learn to the contrary. Cadman marks the skull for surgery then begins. He opens a section of the skull and applies electrodes to parts of the exposed brain. The body responds by lifting his right arm, next by trying to speak, and finally by opening his eyes. Cadman cuts a section of brain away which results in the leakage of cerebral fluid. Ramsay now realizes the cadaver is actually a heavily sedated man. Cadman explains that K6 is under influence of Black Sleep and feels nothing. Ramsay is shocked and horrified and expresses his surprise at the callous disregard for human life Cadman shows.Ramsay is in his room when he hears a knock at the door. A note is shoved under the door. He hears Laurie scream in the hall and goes to investigate. Mungo is attacking the woman. Ramsay tries to help and is attacked by Mungo. Daphne appears from her room and saves Ramsay. Returning to his room, Ramsay reads the note and heads for the kitchen. He hides when Casimir appears carrying a bed warmer. In the kitchen, he meets with Laurie. Laurie explains that Mungo is Dr. Monroe, her father. Casimir interrupts the couple to get coals for the bed warmer. Ramsay comforts Laurie, he explains that Cadman will help and operate on her father. Laurie informs Ramsay that Cadman has already operated. Prior to surgery Dr. Monroe was paralyzed on one side of his body, but otherwise normal and kindly towards her, but after surgery the paralysis was cured, except for the foot dragging, but his personality was completely changed. Laurie tells Ramsay there have been other surgeries but she does not know where the bodies have gone.The next morning Ramsay is finishing his notes on the previous surgery. Cadman expresses his appreciation to have a colleague and trained man to assist in the work. Cadman reviews the notes. Ramsay asks Cadman about the surgery on Dr. Monroe. Cadman finally admits that he damaged the reasoning section of his brain. He also admits the sailor is recovering, but there have been changes. Odo makes a call on Cadman to inform him that he is having trouble obtaining another surgical candidate--a woman, the mistress of Curry. Ramsay is tormented by his work and sleeps fitfully.In London, a woman calls on Odo at his studio. Carmona Daly (Claire Carleton) has come in regards to some work. Odo explains that he is in need of a model, but she expresses reluctance to prostitute herself. Odo assures her that he only wishes to sketch her face. He drugs her, but before he can make transportation arrangements the police pay a call on the studio. Sgt. Steele (an uncredited Peter Gordon) and Roundsman Blevins (an uncredited Clive Morgan) search the studio, with Odo's permission. They are looking for Miss Daly in regards to the Curry murder case. She had provided some information and is needed for further questioning. Odo decides not to revive Carmona Daly and disposes of the antidote.At the abbey, Cadman informs Ramsay that a final experiment, a dual surgery, is to be performed the next day. Ramsay asks Laurie where the post-surgical recovery area is located. She tells Ramsay she does not know. He asks about Curry, but she tells him names are never used, but, ""Dr. Cadman pointed at the big man and said Curry powder comes from India and so does the black sleep, they ought to hit it off."" Ramsay confides his secret and explains he needs to find Curry and alive to free himself. They walk behind the fireplace, but open the wrong door. That passage takes them down into the basement, instead of up to the tower and the surgery. Ramsay opens a locked door and the pair explore. This basement room is the recovery area. They first encounter a very thin man with very long hair. He is named Borg (John Carradine), but he calls himself Bohemond, a crusader. He rambles about the Holy Land. They walk on and find the sailor identified as K6. His face is contorted, one eye closed and skin lesions covering the right side of his face. He begs for help, then tries to kill Dr. Ramsay. Their third discovery is a woman, young Nancy (Sally Yarnell), who laughs maniacally. She is covered in patches of tufts of hair all over her arms and back. Finally, Laurie and Ramsay find Curry (Tor Johnson). Like all the others he is chained to the wall. Curry is now bald, blind and mute. Cadman, Mungo, Daphne and Casimir appear. Ramsay and Laurie are taken out of the basement by force. Curry finds the keys to the chains that Ramsay dropped in his niche. Cadman accuses Ramsay, ""You've been very foolish Dr. Ramsay. Foolish and very ungrateful. I saved your life."" Ramsay demands to be allowed to leave. Cadman refuses. Odo arrives with the dead body of Carmona Daly. Odo suggests Laurie substitute for Miss Daly and Cadman agrees. He will use her during the operation on his wife to avoid sensitive areas of her brain. The police arrive and Casimir is sent to delay their interference. Sgt. Steele presents himself along with Det. Redford (an uncredited John Sheffield) to Cadman. They inquire as to the location of Carmona and Odo, then depart the abbey after Cadman satisfies their questions. Cadman goes to retrieve his wife while Ramsay tries to escape with the now sedated Laurie. He decides to drug Mungo and carry Laurie out. Daphne is attacked behind the fireplace by Borg and the other three basement escapees. Daphne catches fire and runs away. The former surgical patients go up to the surgery. Ramsay administers the antidote to Laurie. Mungo recovers from his anesthesia as Laurie recovers from the Black Sleep. The four former patients enter the surgery and attack Mungo. They dispatch Mungo then turn their attention on Cadman, who arrives with his wife in his arms. Laurie and Ramsay slip past the crowd and escape the room. Cadman is not so lucky. He is chased out of the room and fall off the stairs (no guardrails, remember this is a 10th century abbey). The police are there to greet the pair as they exit the fireplace door. Odo is placed under arrest and taken away. We close with Laurie and Ramsay walking arm in arm away from the abbey.","
    
                    England, 1872. The night before he is to be hanged for a murder he did not commit, young Dr. Gordon Ramsey is visited in his cell by his old mentor, eminent surgeon Sir Joel Cadmund. Cadmund offers to see that Ramsey gets a proper burial and gives him a sleeping powder to get him through the night, which Ramsey takes, unaware it is really an East Indian drug, ""nind andhera"" (""the black sleep""), which induces a deathlike state of anesthesia. Pronounced dead in his cell, he is turned over to Cadmund, who promptly revives him and takes him to his home in a remote abbey. Cadmund explains he believes Ramsey is innocent and needs his talents to help him in an project, which he is reluctant to immediately discuss further. In fact, Cadmund's wife lies in a coma from a deep-seated brain tumor, and he is attempting to find a safe surgical route to its site by experimenting on the brains of others, whom Ramsey comes to learn are alive during the process, anesthetized by the ""black sleep"", and are taken to a hidden recovery room in the abbey from which few emerge, though they still live...

    Synopsis
    The picture opens with narration over a black screen. Basil Rathbone tells us, ""The ancients who wrote in the sensory tongue made first mention of the strange drug they called Nind Andhera. This drug was first introduced into the city of Lahore in the Punjab in the 703rd year after the death of the Prophet, praise his memory. This drug has the power to place a mans body and limbs into helplessness and his soul sleeps. Nor does he feel pain. He is as a dead man, yet he is not of the dead."" Title and credits follow.A wide shot of Newgate Prison in London in the year 1872 is followed by two guards and Sir Joel Cadman (Basil Rathbone) going to see a prisoner. Dr. Gordon Angus Ramsay (Herbert Rudley) is a condemned man, scheduled to hang the next morning. Cadman was his medical school teacher. Ramsay is chained to the wall. He complains that he was convicted on circumstantial evidence of killing a man named Curry. Ramsay does admit to some of the facts, but does not remember most of what occurred. Most distressing to Ramsay is the fact that after being hanged his body is to be delivered to a medical school for dissection, instead of a proper burial. Cadman assures his student that will not happen. He has interceded with the Lord Chief Justice to get that provision of his sentence rescinded. Cadman is to get Ramsay's body and will be buried properly. Cadman pops the top on his walking stick and pours a small amount of powder into a cup. He instructs Ramsay to take a drink in the morning before the guards come for him. He explains it is only a sedative to help him cope with the ordeal. The next morning in his cell, while the crowd outside gets restless, three men stand next to the dead body of Ramsay. The prison doctor pronounces time of death at approximately 5:00 a.m.Odo the Gypsy (Akim Tamiroff) escorts Dr. Cadman to a room containing a coffin containing the body of Dr. Ramsay. Cadman prepares a syringe and inject the antidote into the arm of Ramsay, which shows signs of rigor mortis. Cadman and Odo hold the body down. Ramsay begins to revive, his body racked with spasms and labored breathing. Cadman informs his student, ""You're dead Dr. Ramsay."" He then reads the Death Certificate to Ramsay. Odo and Cadman lift Ramsay out of the coffin. Cadman reveals that the antidote must be administered within twelve hours or death occurs, and his reason for the rescue from the hangman. Cadman objects to state sponsored murder and that he needs the help of a skilled surgeon. Ramsay voices his appreciation.At St. Griffins, an old abbey on the east coast of England, Cadman and Ramsay arrive by carriage. Casimir (Bela Lugosi) answers the door and takes their hats and coats. An immediate commotion ensues. Laurie Monroe (Patricia Blair as Patricia Blake) runs screaming to Dr. Cadman followed her tormentor, Mungo (Lon Chaney) formerly Dr. Monroe. Mungo approaches dragging one foot and is unresponsive to Dr. Cadman's orders to stop. Mungo pushes aside the two medical men and attacks Laurie. Daphne (Phyllis Stanley), Cadman's nurse appears. She is the only person who has any influence over Mungo. Mungo releases Laurie and takes Daphne's hand then limps away. Cadman escorts Ramsay to his room. Daphne tends to the comatose body of Cadman's wife, Angelina (an uncredited Louanna Gardner). She brushes her hair and takes her temperature. Cadman enters and is briefed on his wife's condition. Cadman tells his nurse he must operate soon. He plans brain surgery to cure the paralysis and coma.The next morning the two medical men have breakfast and discuss the Mungo mishap. Ramsay thinks Mungo looks familiar and is informed that Mungo was a lecturer at the medical college, Dr. Monroe. He suffered a brain disease and Cadman promises to cure him. Cadman then shows Ramsay a diagram of the brain and explains the areas and their functions. The full nature of Ramsay's task is explained, ""The work is too complex for one man. You, doctor, you shall help me complete my chart."" Cadman leads Ramsay through a door at the back of a large, open, fireplace. The secret door leads to an old part of the abbey tower Cadman now uses for his surgery. Daphne and Laurie are already present and preparing a cadaver for surgery. Cadman and Ramsay wash their hands while Daphne finishes shaving the head of K6, a sailor (George Sawaya). Ramsay is under the impression that the sailor is a cadaver, but will soon learn to the contrary. Cadman marks the skull for surgery then begins. He opens a section of the skull and applies electrodes to parts of the exposed brain. The body responds by lifting his right arm, next by trying to speak, and finally by opening his eyes. Cadman cuts a section of brain away which results in the leakage of cerebral fluid. Ramsay now realizes the cadaver is actually a heavily sedated man. Cadman explains that K6 is under influence of Black Sleep and feels nothing. Ramsay is shocked and horrified and expresses his surprise at the callous disregard for human life Cadman shows.Ramsay is in his room when he hears a knock at the door. A note is shoved under the door. He hears Laurie scream in the hall and goes to investigate. Mungo is attacking the woman. Ramsay tries to help and is attacked by Mungo. Daphne appears from her room and saves Ramsay. Returning to his room, Ramsay reads the note and heads for the kitchen. He hides when Casimir appears carrying a bed warmer. In the kitchen, he meets with Laurie. Laurie explains that Mungo is Dr. Monroe, her father. Casimir interrupts the couple to get coals for the bed warmer. Ramsay comforts Laurie, he explains that Cadman will help and operate on her father. Laurie informs Ramsay that Cadman has already operated. Prior to surgery Dr. Monroe was paralyzed on one side of his body, but otherwise normal and kindly towards her, but after surgery the paralysis was cured, except for the foot dragging, but his personality was completely changed. Laurie tells Ramsay there have been other surgeries but she does not know where the bodies have gone.The next morning Ramsay is finishing his notes on the previous surgery. Cadman expresses his appreciation to have a colleague and trained man to assist in the work. Cadman reviews the notes. Ramsay asks Cadman about the surgery on Dr. Monroe. Cadman finally admits that he damaged the reasoning section of his brain. He also admits the sailor is recovering, but there have been changes. Odo makes a call on Cadman to inform him that he is having trouble obtaining another surgical candidate--a woman, the mistress of Curry. Ramsay is tormented by his work and sleeps fitfully.In London, a woman calls on Odo at his studio. Carmona Daly (Claire Carleton) has come in regards to some work. Odo explains that he is in need of a model, but she expresses reluctance to prostitute herself. Odo assures her that he only wishes to sketch her face. He drugs her, but before he can make transportation arrangements the police pay a call on the studio. Sgt. Steele (an uncredited Peter Gordon) and Roundsman Blevins (an uncredited Clive Morgan) search the studio, with Odo's permission. They are looking for Miss Daly in regards to the Curry murder case. She had provided some information and is needed for further questioning. Odo decides not to revive Carmona Daly and disposes of the antidote.At the abbey, Cadman informs Ramsay that a final experiment, a dual surgery, is to be performed the next day. Ramsay asks Laurie where the post-surgical recovery area is located. She tells Ramsay she does not know. He asks about Curry, but she tells him names are never used, but, ""Dr. Cadman pointed at the big man and said Curry powder comes from India and so does the black sleep, they ought to hit it off.""

She comes over to talk to the reporter. Steve asks about her father and is told he is fine and meeting with security officials. She departs to find a doctor to attend to Steve. He begins his flashback, ""It was still hard for me to believe that I could be lying here in a hospital alive. When I think of the thousands of others, dead and dying in the ruins around me. When I think back only a few days ago. I was enroute to Cairo, with a few days layover in Tokyo."" Steve was planning to meet with an old college friend, Dr. Serizawa, a theoretical scientist who was gaining great recognition in the Far East for his unusual experiments.A ship at sea is attacked by an unseen menace. It sinks, burning, but not before a radio distress signal is sent. Steve is processing in with Customs when Serizawa's assistant meets him in line to tell him Serizawa is unavailable. Another man, an official, takes Steve to a security office for questioning. The security officer, Tomo Iwanaga (Frank Iwanaga) asks Steve if, during the flight, he noticed anything unusual happen. Steve notes that everyone on the flight is being questioned and wants to know why. Steve presents his reporter's credentials but is told by Iwanaga that he doesn't think the reason should be printed. He does volunteer that a ship was sunk and the crew reported a blinding flash of light and the ocean burst into flames. Steve expresses interest in the story and is invited to a briefing with the ship owners.A rescue ship is sent to investigate, but it is also destroyed. Steve calls his office in Chicago to report that eight ships have been destroyed so far with the same method. He informs his editor he intends to stay and report on the developing story. A few survivors, who were found, died of shock and strange burns. A meeting of security officials and top scientists was called. Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura) was invited. Steve had met the scientist through his association with Serizawa. Steve is present at the meeting and Iwanaga translates. Odo Island seems to be close to the disasters, so it is decided the research should start there.On the island, wreckage washes up with a survivor, but he soon dies. The next day a helicopter is sent to Odo Island. Steve managed to get an invite. The officials want to question the natives. Steve and Tomo Iwanaga talk to a native who is very frightened and claims he saw a monster. They spend the night on the island and watch an ancient ceremony that is related to a legend, Godzilla. That evening the wind picks up and they are caught in a typhoon. The next morning officials brought some of the islanders back to the mainland to make a direct report. Each of the natives said a living creature was responsible for the damage. Dr. Yamane proposes a research party should investigate Odo Island. Steve asks Yamana for permission to be included.The ship departs for the island. On board Emiko is talking to a young Marine officer named Ogata (Akira Takarada). Despite her engagement to Serizawa she is very friendly with Ogata. They arrive on the island and begin work. It is noticed that some areas are contaminated with radiation. Yamane notices the large footprints of a living creature and they are also radioactive. He finds a living fossil--a trilobite. A man rings an alarm bell and calls the name Godzilla. They head for the hills. Loud footsteps are heard, then above a mountain ridge the beast appears. Only the head and neck are visible. The beast roars and the islanders and scientists scatter. Emiko falls, but Ogata picks her up and they run for safety. As quickly as it appeared, Godzilla retreats back into the ocean. The crowd runs to the top of the ridge, but all they see are the creatures enormous footprints leading back to the water.Yamane gives his report of the findings on the island. He postulates Godzilla is an intermediary between ancient land and sea creatures. A picture of the creature taken on the island shows it to be 400 feet tall. He blames H-bomb experimentation for the resurrection of the beast. Steve calls his editor, George Lawrence (an uncredited Mikel Conrad) to provide an update. Steve tells George that the military intends to use depth bombs on Godzilla. Steve next calls Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata), who is working in his laboratory. They make a date for dinner the next evening. Serizawa will be meeting with Emiko this evening.Steve explains that Serizawa and Emiko were betrothed when they were both children. Emiko does not love the scientist, but she does have great respect for him. She is working up the courage to tell Serizawa she intends to marry Ogata. Before she can tell him her news, he insists that she witness something in the laboratory. Sarizawa drops a small tablet into a large fish tank. He applies power, and the water begins to churn and boil. Emiko screams at the sight of something happening in the tank. The pair exit the lab, Emiko still visibly upset. Serizawa swears Emiko to secrecy regarding his discovery. She returns to Ogata but tells him nothing.The Japanese Navy drops depth charges into Tokyo Bay. Dr. Yamane, Emiko, and Ogata watch this on television. Yamane is visibly upset and leaves the room. Emiko goes to check on her father. Yamane does not want the creature killed; He wants it studied. A party boat out in Tokyo Bay spots Godzilla surface and panic ensues. The military prepares for an attack. That evening Godzilla surfaces in the bay and is met by military force. It wades ashore and destroys a train station, picking a train carriage up in its mouth. As people scatter from the menace, Steve and Tomo witness the destruction from higher ground. After a brief time, Godzilla returns to the water. The city of Tokyo is surrounded by large electricity transmission towers carrying 300,000 volts. They hope that will keep the creature out of the city. Non-essential personnel are evacuated from the city. The newspaper office is high up in a building and allows a good view of the city. Steve uses a tape recorder for his observations. That evening Godzilla again walks out of Tokyo Bay. He walks through the high voltage lines, then destroys a few of the towers. Godzilla's hot breath melts the surrounding transmission towers. They glow red hot, then soften and collapse. Again, using its hot breath, sections of the city are engulfed in flames. The creature is impervious to tank fire. Fleeing people are either burned or crushed under foot by the rampaging beast. The newspaper building is destroyed with Steve still reporting from inside. Leaving the city in flames, Godzilla returns to Tokyo Bay. Fighter Jets launch missiles at the creature, but they also have no effect.Steve wakes in the hospital surrounded by Emiko and Ogata. She tells Steve about the terrible weapon Serizawa has invented. Emiko recounts her visit to the lab and provides details about the oxygen destroyer and the terrible effect it had on the fish. The weapon dissolves the flesh from anything it touches.Emiko and Ogata go to see Serizawa at his home. Ogata confronts Serizawa and demands that the discovery be used on Godzilla. Serizawa refuses and he and Ogata scuffle over the formula and papers in the laboratory. Serizawa is concerned his terrible weapon may fall into the wrong hands. To assure himself it won't be misused or stolen, Serizawa destroys all his notes and insists he personally deploy the weapon.Serizawa and Ogata dive into Tokyo Bay to place the weapon to destroy Godzilla. They find the creature prowling around and walk closer. They place the weapon and Ogata surfaces, but Serizawa remains behind and deploys the weapon. Godzilla writhes in pain as the chemical strips his flesh away. Serizawa reports the weapon is working, and then he cuts his line to the surface. Godzilla briefly surfaces and bellows his defeat, then sinks and is devoured by the chemical leaving only his skeleton.We close with a scene of the ocean at sunset and Steve Martin reporting, ""The menace was gone; so was a great man.

When I think back only a few days ago. I was enroute to Cairo, with a few days layover in Tokyo."" Steve was planning to meet with an old college friend, Dr. Serizawa, a theoretical scientist who was gaining great recognition in the Far East for his unusual experiments.A ship at sea is attacked by an unseen menace. It sinks, burning, but not before a radio distress signal is sent. Steve is processing in with Customs when Serizawa's assistant meets him in line to tell him Serizawa is unavailable. Another man, an official, takes Steve to a security office for questioning. The security officer, Tomo Iwanaga (Frank Iwanaga) asks Steve if, during the flight, he noticed anything unusual happen. Steve notes that everyone on the flight is being questioned and wants to know why. Steve presents his reporter's credentials but is told by Iwanaga that he doesn't think the reason should be printed. He does volunteer that a ship was sunk and the crew reported a blinding flash of light and the ocean burst into flames. Steve expresses interest in the story and is invited to a briefing with the ship owners.A rescue ship is sent to investigate, but it is also destroyed. Steve calls his office in Chicago to report that eight ships have been destroyed so far with the same method. He informs his editor he intends to stay and report on the developing story. A few survivors, who were found, died of shock and strange burns. A meeting of security officials and top scientists was called. Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura) was invited. Steve had met the scientist through his association with Serizawa. Steve is present at the meeting and Iwanaga translates. Odo Island seems to be close to the disasters, so it is decided the research should start there.On the island, wreckage washes up with a survivor, but he soon dies. The next day a helicopter is sent to Odo Island. Steve managed to get an invite. The officials want to question the natives. Steve and Tomo Iwanaga talk to a native who is very frightened and claims he saw a monster. They spend the night on the island and watch an ancient ceremony that is related to a legend, Godzilla. That evening the wind picks up and they are caught in a typhoon. The next morning officials brought some of the islanders back to the mainland to make a direct report. Each of the natives said a living creature was responsible for the damage. Dr. Yamane proposes a research party should investigate Odo Island. Steve asks Yamana for permission to be included.The ship departs for the island. On board Emiko is talking to a young Marine officer named Ogata (Akira Takarada). Despite her engagement to Serizawa she is very friendly with Ogata. They arrive on the island and begin work. It is noticed that some areas are contaminated with radiation. Yamane notices the large footprints of a living creature and they are also radioactive. He finds a living fossil--a trilobite. A man rings an alarm bell and calls the name Godzilla. They head for the hills. Loud footsteps are heard, then above a mountain ridge the beast appears. Only the head and neck are visible. The beast roars and the islanders and scientists scatter. Emiko falls, but Ogata picks her up and they run for safety. As quickly as it appeared, Godzilla retreats back into the ocean. The crowd runs to the top of the ridge, but all they see are the creatures enormous footprints leading back to the water.Yamane gives his report of the findings on the island. He postulates Godzilla is an intermediary between ancient land and sea creatures. A picture of the creature taken on the island shows it to be 400 feet tall. He blames H-bomb experimentation for the resurrection of the beast. Steve calls his editor, George Lawrence (an uncredited Mikel Conrad) to provide an update. Steve tells George that the military intends to use depth bombs on Godzilla. Steve next calls Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata), who is working in his laboratory. They make a date for dinner the next evening. Serizawa will be meeting with Emiko this evening.Steve explains that Serizawa and Emiko were betrothed when they were both children. Emiko does not love the scientist, but she does have great respect for him. She is working up the courage to tell Serizawa she intends to marry Ogata. Before she can tell him her news, he insists that she witness something in the laboratory. Sarizawa drops a small tablet into a large fish tank. He applies power, and the water begins to churn and boil. Emiko screams at the sight of something happening in the tank. The pair exit the lab, Emiko still visibly upset. Serizawa swears Emiko to secrecy regarding his discovery. She returns to Ogata but tells him nothing.The Japanese Navy drops depth charges into Tokyo Bay. Dr. Yamane, Emiko, and Ogata watch this on television. Yamane is visibly upset and leaves the room. Emiko goes to check on her father. Yamane does not want the creature killed; He wants it studied. A party boat out in Tokyo Bay spots Godzilla surface and panic ensues. The military prepares for an attack. That evening Godzilla surfaces in the bay and is met by military force. It wades ashore and destroys a train station, picking a train carriage up in its mouth. As people scatter from the menace, Steve and Tomo witness the destruction from higher ground. After a brief time, Godzilla returns to the water. The city of Tokyo is surrounded by large electricity transmission towers carrying 300,000 volts. They hope that will keep the creature out of the city. Non-essential personnel are evacuated from the city. The newspaper office is high up in a building and allows a good view of the city. Steve uses a tape recorder for his observations. That evening Godzilla again walks out of Tokyo Bay. He walks through the high voltage lines, then destroys a few of the towers. Godzilla's hot breath melts the surrounding transmission towers. They glow red hot, then soften and collapse. Again, using its hot breath, sections of the city are engulfed in flames. The creature is impervious to tank fire. Fleeing people are either burned or crushed under foot by the rampaging beast. The newspaper building is destroyed with Steve still reporting from inside. Leaving the city in flames, Godzilla returns to Tokyo Bay. Fighter Jets launch missiles at the creature, but they also have no effect.Steve wakes in the hospital surrounded by Emiko and Ogata. She tells Steve about the terrible weapon Serizawa has invented. Emiko recounts her visit to the lab and provides details about the oxygen destroyer and the terrible effect it had on the fish. The weapon dissolves the flesh from anything it touches.Emiko and Ogata go to see Serizawa at his home. Ogata confronts Serizawa and demands that the discovery be used on Godzilla. Serizawa refuses and he and Ogata scuffle over the formula and papers in the laboratory. Serizawa is concerned his terrible weapon may fall into the wrong hands. To assure himself it won't be misused or stolen, Serizawa destroys all his notes and insists he personally deploy the weapon.Serizawa and Ogata dive into Tokyo Bay to place the weapon to destroy Godzilla. They find the creature prowling around and walk closer. They place the weapon and Ogata surfaces, but Serizawa remains behind and deploys the weapon. Godzilla writhes in pain as the chemical strips his flesh away. Serizawa reports the weapon is working, and then he cuts his line to the surface. Godzilla briefly surfaces and bellows his defeat, then sinks and is devoured by the chemical leaving only his skeleton.We close with a scene of the ocean at sunset and Steve Martin reporting, ""The menace was gone; so was a great man. But the whole world could wake up and live again.""

The friendship between bull and boy is threatened when Gitano's legal owners claim the animal and ship it off to the bullring. Moved by the boy's plight, the President of Mexico signs a ""pardon"" for Gitano - but not soon enough to prevent the bull's appearance at the Plaze de Mexico at Mexico City, where he faces top matador Fermin Rivera. Based on a true incident, the film earned a ""best story"" Academy Award for one Robert Rich - who, much to the embarrassment of the Academy (and the delight of civil libertarians) turned out to be blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo.

"45","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049370/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","After the credits we open in a laboratory/control room for launching and monitoring satellites. Ellen Peters (Karen Kadler) announces that an unidentified object has been spotted. Her colleague, Pete Shelton (Charles B. Griffith) states that all aircraft should have been out of the area twenty minutes ago. The project manager, Dr. Paul Nelson (Peter Graves) notes that a commercial airliner is just off course. They are three minutes from launch. In Washington, D.C., Secretary Platt (Marshall Bradford) is meeting with Dr. Tom Anderson (Lee Van Cleef) when General Carpenter (David McMahon) enters the office. Anderson is there to beg Platt to call off the satellite project. When Anderson asks about the first satellite launched, he is told it exploded in orbit. Anderson tells them why, ""It was a warning. I anticipated that three years before it was launched."" He informs them that, ""Alien intelligence watches us constantly."" Much to his annoyance, Anderson is told the satellite has already been launched.At the Anderson home, Tom and his wife Claire (Beverly Garland) are entertaining Dr. Paul Nelson and his wife, Joan (Sally Fraser). They are just finishing dinner. Nelson reports that the satellite has been in orbit for three months and all is well. Joan voices her annoyance that the men are always talking shop. Claire's concern is more directed at her husband and what she feels are his delusions. The girls work on the dishes while the boys examine Anderson's new radio. He tunes in a station and tells Nelson that the sound is the planet Venus. Within the hum and static he tells Nelson to listen to the voice. At that moment, the phone rings. It is for Nelson; the project is calling to tell him the satellite left its orbit and flew out into space. The Nelsons hastily excuse themselves and drive to the nearby installation. The military lead, General Pattick (Russ Bender) arrives first. Pvt. Manuel Ortiz (Jonathan Haze) and Sgt. Neil (Dick Miller) clear him through the gate.The Andersons are in the living room. Claire is upset that her husband made a fool of himself in front of the Nelsons. The Nelsons arrive at the Installation and are cleared through. When Nelson enters the lab he's told by Pete Shelton that ""its back"". Pete, Ellen and Dr. Nelson exit the lab. Nelson tells them to get the reports to Washington before morning and that they'll bring the satellite down for a full examination. Nelson and his wife then drive home. It is early in the morning and Anderson gets out of bed and tunes in the radio set up in the living room. He's talking to something on board the satellite. Claire comes out to ask him back to bed. He tells her the creature from Venus is on board and will be coming to Earth to save us. Claire is exasperated; She is convinced her husband is crazy.The next day the team brings the satellite back, but something goes wrong. Instead of the designated landing area, it crash lands ten miles south of the Anderson home, at a location near a cave and hot springs. When Anderson tells his wife, ""he's alive, he survived the crash."" She responds, ""Tom, youre a sick man."" She tells him she's going into town and hopes he's better when she returns. The Venusian creature exits the satellite. It looks like a giant squash or pickle with horns and claws on long arms. Almost immediately electricity all over the world fails. The Nelson car stops on the road. At the installation the power is off and the phones are dead. Ellen Peters notes how quiet it is. Floyd Mason (Paul Harbor), her colleague, reminds her that it is always quiet in the mountains. Floyd tells the general that the satellite is down; the signals were coming through before the power failure. The Nelsons note the time as 3:03 p.m. when all the clocks stopped. They decide to walk up to the Anderson home to call a garage. Anderson is reading off names to his Venusian master. Eight people are on the list for mind control devices. The creature expels bat like flying objects that will home in on their prey. In town people are beginning to panic. The crowd asks Haskell (Thomas E. Jackson) the newspaper editor what's happening in the rest of the world. Haskell tells them he doesn't know; the wire service broke down. A woman asks Sheriff Shallert (Taggart Casey) what she can do about her husband's iron lung machine. Anderson comes into town to collect his wife and is attacked on the street by a man. The sheriff breaks up the fight. Nelson and Joan are closer to the Anderson home; they stop to rest. They notice one of the bat-like creatures flying. Nelson throws a rock at it, but it misses. The Andersons drive home. He has the only working vehicle on earth. He tells her that electricity and combustion engines have been disabled. Even the water won't work. Claire is incredulous; she turns on the hose on their house and nearly hits her husband with the stream. He tells her, ""That works because it belongs to me.""As the Sheriff is pushing cars off the road in town the bat-creature stings him leaving an electrical device imbedded in his neck. Like a bee, once it has stung its target it dies. The victim immediately disposes of the dead creature. The Nelsons arrive at the Anderson home and are greeted on the steps. They are invited in for a drink.With all vehicles dead, General Pattick walks to headquarters. Along the way he encounters one of the bat-creatures. It stings him, and like the Sheriff he disposes of the dead creature. And like the Sheriff, he is now under the control of the Venusian.Anderson tells Nelson the story so far, but Nelson doesn't believe him. Nelson does ask why Anderson isn't fighting it. Anderson says that his friend is here on earth to rescue mankind not to conquer. Nelson and his wife get into the Anderson car while Anderson calls the Venusian to tell him to trace the energy from the car to locate and possess Dr. Paul Nelson and his wife, Joan. The Andersons drive the Nelsons home.At the installation, General Pattick tells the technicians that, ""Were in the midst of a Communist Uprising, they've sabotaged every power source in the area."" He orders the staff to remain at the installation. The city of Beachwood is evacuated. Nelson takes his bike to the installation, but no sooner does he leave but a bat creature stings his wife, Joan. As he is biking through town he notices the Sheriff order Haskell out of town. When the newspaper editor refuses he is shot dead by the Sheriff. Nelson demands an explanation. When the Sheriff tells Nelson he is going to place him under protective custody, Nelson slugs him. The Sheriff cold cocks him with his gun, but before he can kill him gets a message from the Venusian to stop. He tells Nelson, ""you're to be one of us...Get up, you're free."" Nelson gets back on his bike and leaves.Anderson tells his wife about the control devices--the bat-like creatures. They plant a radiological device in the subject's neck. He tells her that once infected they are subjects of the benefactor and lose all emotions. Claire is horrified by such a condition.Nelson arrives on his bicycle to find the installation closed. General Pattick is there to greet him. He tells Nelson that the staff was relocated to a nearby air base and that he and his wife should join them. He offers him a ride in the jeep and they put his bike in back. Nelson notices the jeep is running and suspects something. He invents a diversion, and hits the general on the back of the neck with his gun. He tosses the general out and commandeers the jeep. He drives to see Anderson and confronts him in his home. He calls him a murderer. Anderson tells him about the Venusian and the part he played. Anderson tries to convince Nelson about the benefit the alien proposes, but Nelson isn't buying any of it. Nelson leaves after calling Anderson a traitor. Claire tells her husband that he barely avoided being killed. Nelson had a gun. She chides him, ""you just had an undeserved stay of execution."" He contacts the alien, but it refuses to meet with him. No sooner has Nelson's lack of control been reported, but his commandeered jeep stops running. Fortunately he has his bike in back and peddles home. It is dusk when he arrives, but he doesn't notice the lights are on, both outside and inside the house. His wife greets him. She has a control device and throws it at him, then leaves the house for a walk. Nelson fights it off and manages to kill the thing. As soon as the control device is killed Anderson calls Nelson and invites him back over to his house to talk. Nelson tells him he has something to do first. His wife comes home and he pretends to be controlled. She tells him they will be controlled for the rest of their lives. At this, he shoots and kills Joan.After his phone call, the alien tells Anderson to kill Nelson. Claire interrogates her husband about the Venusian. She tries her best to dissuade him from his grim task. He tells her the Venusian is established at Elephant Hot Spring cave because he needs a climate like Venus. He also tells her that Joan has been controlled. Two of the remaining devices have been used. The original targets were the mayor and his wife, but they were killed in the evacuation. Anderson won't tell his wife, but they were used on Pete and Floyd at the installation.At the installation, Ellen wakes up and notices all the equipment functioning. She goes to make coffee and finds the two dead control devices. Floyd kills Ellen while Pete looks on, unemotional. Nelson arrives at the Anderson home in Joan's station wagon. Claire makes her final appeal to her husband, but to no avail. He leaves the house to meet Nelson outside. Furious, she contacts the alien on the radio and threatens it, ""Do you hear that, I'm going to kill you."" She grabs the rifle that Anderson placed on top of the radio and leaves the house through the garage. As Nelson and her husband walk up the stairs into the house she steals Joan's station wagon and departs armed and ready for a confrontation with the Venusian. She drives full speed to the cave.Nelson informs Anderson that his wife is dead. ""I killed her...not my wife, she wasn't my wife; She was a product of your work."" He threatens Anderson, but wants information first. While Nelson interrogates Anderson, Claire arrives at the cave and enters looking for her quarry. As Anderson goes to retrieve his rifle he notices it is missing. Claire finds and confronts the Venusian, ""you're ugly, horrible...go on try your intellect on me...you think you're going to make a slave of the world...I'll see you in hell first."" She fires round after round with no effect. It kills her while her husband hears it on the radio at home. That changes things for Anderson. He tells Nelson that he'll take him to the installation, that Pete and Floyd are controlled. He will go to the cave and kill the creature.Pvt. Ortiz, while out foraging for food, finds Joan's station wagon just outside the cave and hears Claire's screams.

                    One of several remaining members of its race, an alien from Venus is guided to Earth by disgruntled scientist Tom Anderson, who tells it which humans it should attach mind control devices to. Among them is his old friend, fellow scientist Paul Nelson. Nelson, after killing a flying bat-thing which carries the device, finally persuades the paranoid Anderson that he's been wrong to ally himself with an alien bent on world domination. They hurriedly leave when they discover Tom's wife has picked up a rifle and gone to the alien's cave to try to kill it.

    Synopsis
    After the credits we open in a laboratory/control room for launching and monitoring satellites. Ellen Peters (Karen Kadler) announces that an unidentified object has been spotted. Her colleague, Pete Shelton (Charles B. Griffith) states that all aircraft should have been out of the area twenty minutes ago. The project manager, Dr. Paul Nelson (Peter Graves) notes that a commercial airliner is just off course. They are three minutes from launch. In Washington, D.C., Secretary Platt (Marshall Bradford) is meeting with Dr. Tom Anderson (Lee Van Cleef) when General Carpenter (David McMahon) enters the office. Anderson is there to beg Platt to call off the satellite project. When Anderson asks about the first satellite launched, he is told it exploded in orbit. Anderson tells them why, ""It was a warning. I anticipated that three years before it was launched."" He informs them that, ""Alien intelligence watches us constantly."" Much to his annoyance, Anderson is told the satellite has already been launched.At the Anderson home, Tom and his wife Claire (Beverly Garland) are entertaining Dr. Paul Nelson and his wife, Joan (Sally Fraser). They are just finishing dinner. Nelson reports that the satellite has been in orbit for three months and all is well. Joan voices her annoyance that the men are always talking shop. Claire's concern is more directed at her husband and what she feels are his delusions. The girls work on the dishes while the boys examine Anderson's new radio. He tunes in a station and tells Nelson that the sound is the planet Venus. Within the hum and static he tells Nelson to listen to the voice. At that moment, the phone rings. It is for Nelson; the project is calling to tell him the satellite left its orbit and flew out into space. The Nelsons hastily excuse themselves and drive to the nearby installation. The military lead, General Pattick (Russ Bender) arrives first. Pvt. Manuel Ortiz (Jonathan Haze) and Sgt. Neil (Dick Miller) clear him through the gate.The Andersons are in the living room. Claire is upset that her husband made a fool of himself in front of the Nelsons. The Nelsons arrive at the Installation and are cleared through. When Nelson enters the lab he's told by Pete Shelton that ""its back"". Pete, Ellen and Dr. Nelson exit the lab. Nelson tells them to get the reports to Washington before morning and that they'll bring the satellite down for a full examination. Nelson and his wife then drive home. It is early in the morning and Anderson gets out of bed and tunes in the radio set up in the living room. He's talking to something on board the satellite. Claire comes out to ask him back to bed. He tells her the creature from Venus is on board and will be coming to Earth to save us. Claire is exasperated; She is convinced her husband is crazy.The next day the team brings the satellite back, but something goes wrong. Instead of the designated landing area, it crash lands ten miles south of the Anderson home, at a location near a cave and hot springs. When Anderson tells his wife, ""he's alive, he survived the crash."" She responds, ""Tom, youre a sick man."" She tells him she's going into town and hopes he's better when she returns. The Venusian creature exits the satellite. It looks like a giant squash or pickle with horns and claws on long arms. Almost immediately electricity all over the world fails. The Nelson car stops on the road. At the installation the power is off and the phones are dead. Ellen Peters notes how quiet it is. Floyd Mason (Paul Harbor), her colleague, reminds her that it is always quiet in the mountains. Floyd tells the general that the satellite is down; the signals were coming through before the power failure. The Nelsons note the time as 3:03 p.m. when all the clocks stopped. They decide to walk up to the Anderson home to call a garage. Anderson is reading off names to his Venusian master. Eight people are on the list for mind control devices. The creature expels bat like flying objects that will home in on their prey. In town people are beginning to panic. The crowd asks Haskell (Thomas E. Jackson) the newspaper editor what's happening in the rest of the world. Haskell tells them he doesn't know; the wire service broke down. A woman asks Sheriff Shallert (Taggart Casey) what she can do about her husband's iron lung machine. Anderson comes into town to collect his wife and is attacked on the street by a man. The sheriff breaks up the fight. Nelson and Joan are closer to the Anderson home; they stop to rest. They notice one of the bat-like creatures flying. Nelson throws a rock at it, but it misses. The Andersons drive home. He has the only working vehicle on earth. He tells her that electricity and combustion engines have been disabled. Even the water won't work. Claire is incredulous; she turns on the hose on their house and nearly hits her husband with the stream. He tells her, ""That works because it belongs to me.""As the Sheriff is pushing cars off the road in town the bat-creature stings him leaving an electrical device imbedded in his neck. Like a bee, once it has stung its target it dies. The victim immediately disposes of the dead creature. The Nelsons arrive at the Anderson home and are greeted on the steps. They are invited in for a drink.With all vehicles dead, General Pattick walks to headquarters. Along the way he encounters one of the bat-creatures. It stings him, and like the Sheriff he disposes of the dead creature. And like the Sheriff, he is now under the control of the Venusian.Anderson tells Nelson the story so far, but Nelson doesn't believe him. Nelson does ask why Anderson isn't fighting it. Anderson says that his friend is here on earth to rescue mankind not to conquer. Nelson and his wife get into the Anderson car while Anderson calls the Venusian to tell him to trace the energy from the car to locate and possess Dr. Paul Nelson and his wife, Joan. The Andersons drive the Nelsons home.At the installation, General Pattick tells the technicians that, ""Were in the midst of a Communist Uprising, they've sabotaged every power source in the area."" He orders the staff to remain at the installation. The city of Beachwood is evacuated. Nelson takes his bike to the installation, but no sooner does he leave but a bat creature stings his wife, Joan. As he is biking through town he notices the Sheriff order Haskell out of town. When the newspaper editor refuses he is shot dead by the Sheriff. Nelson demands an explanation. When the Sheriff tells Nelson he is going to place him under protective custody, Nelson slugs him. The Sheriff cold cocks him with his gun, but before he can kill him gets a message from the Venusian to stop. He tells Nelson, ""you're to be one of us...Get up, you're free."" Nelson gets back on his bike and leaves.Anderson tells his wife about the control devices--the bat-like creatures. They plant a radiological device in the subject's neck. He tells her that once infected they are subjects of the benefactor and lose all emotions. Claire is horrified by such a condition.Nelson arrives on his bicycle to find the installation closed. General Pattick is there to greet him. He tells Nelson that the staff was relocated to a nearby air base and that he and his wife should join them. He offers him a ride in the jeep and they put his bike in back. Nelson notices the jeep is running and suspects something. He invents a diversion, and hits the general on the back of the neck with his gun. He tosses the general out and commandeers the jeep. He drives to see Anderson and confronts him in his home. He calls him a murderer. Anderson tells him about the Venusian and the part he played. Anderson tries to convince Nelson about the benefit the alien proposes, but Nelson isn't buying any of it. Nelson leaves after calling Anderson a traitor. Claire tells her husband that he barely avoided being killed. Nelson had a gun. She chides him, ""you just had an undeserved stay of execution."" He contacts the alien, but it refuses to meet with him. No sooner has Nelson's lack of control been reported, but his commandeered jeep stops running. Fortunately he has his bike in back and peddles home. It is dusk when he arrives, but he doesn't notice the lights are on, both outside and inside the house. His wife greets him. She has a control device and throws it at him, then leaves the house for a walk. Nelson fights it off and manages to kill the thing. As soon as the control device is killed Anderson calls Nelson and invites him back over to his house to talk. Nelson tells him he has something to do first. His wife comes home and he pretends to be controlled. She tells him they will be controlled for the rest of their lives. At this, he shoots and kills Joan.After his phone call, the alien tells Anderson to kill Nelson. Claire interrogates her husband about the Venusian. She tries her best to dissuade him from his grim task. He tells her the Venusian is established at Elephant Hot Spring cave because he needs a climate like Venus. He also tells her that Joan has been controlled. Two of the remaining devices have been used. The original targets were the mayor and his wife, but they were killed in the evacuation. Anderson won't tell his wife, but they were used on Pete and Floyd at the installation.At the installation, Ellen wakes up and notices all the equipment functioning. She goes to make coffee and finds the two dead control devices. Floyd kills Ellen while Pete looks on, unemotional. Nelson arrives at the Anderson home in Joan's station wagon. Claire makes her final appeal to her husband, but to no avail. He leaves the house to meet Nelson outside. Furious, she contacts the alien on the radio and threatens it, ""Do you hear that, I'm going to kill you."" She grabs the rifle that Anderson placed on top of the radio and leaves the house through the garage. As Nelson and her husband walk up the stairs into the house she steals Joan's station wagon and departs armed and ready for a confrontation with the Venusian. She drives full speed to the cave.Nelson informs Anderson that his wife is dead. ""I killed her...not my wife, she wasn't my wife; She was a product of your work."" He threatens Anderson, but wants information first. While Nelson interrogates Anderson, Claire arrives at the cave and enters looking for her quarry. As Anderson goes to retrieve his rifle he notices it is missing. Claire finds and confronts the Venusian, ""you're ugly, horrible...go on try your intellect on me...you think you're going to make a slave of the world...I'll see you in hell first."" She fires round after round with no effect. It kills her while her husband hears it on the radio at home. That changes things for Anderson. He tells Nelson that he'll take him to the installation, that Pete and Floyd are controlled. He will go to the cave and kill the creature.Pvt. Ortiz, while out foraging for food, finds Joan's station wagon just outside the cave and hears Claire's screams. He enters the cave and fires at the creature, but manages to escape and return to his unit to report. Nelson enters the installation grounds and finds Ellen's body outside. He enters an office and shoots Pete, Floyd and General Pattick. He only manages to wound Pattick, but steals his working jeep. Anderson, in his own car, encounters the Sheriff blocking and guarding the road to the cave. He fires at Anderson, but Anderson circles around on foot and attacks him with a portable welding torch. The military detachment enters the cave. Gen. Pattick jumps into another jeep and heads for the cave. Nelson's jeep stops, he gets out and starts walking, but hears the general's jeep approaching and ambushes it. He shoots and kills the general and drives the jeep to the cave. The military unit opens fire on the Venusian, but it has little effect other than drawing it outside. Even a bazooka blast has no effect. Anderson pulls up in the commandeered police car and orders a cease fire. He lights up the torch and attacks the Venusian. It attacks and kills Anderson. They both die in a heap. Nelson pulls up in the jeep and gives his, ""he learned almost too late that man is a feeling creature..."" speech as we see the earth in space.

And Kay does proceed with the divorce despite believing theirs was a happy and loving marriage before she learned of the indiscretion, and despite having an adolescent daughter, Debbie, to consider. But when Kay learns some information of the goings-on within her social circle, she decides to take back control of her married status while exacting a little revenge.

                    In the fall of 1939, the German heavy cruiser (referred to as a pocket battleship) Graf Spee seems to have command of the Atlantic. In the first three months of World War II, she was responsible for sinking 9 ships. The British sent three cruisers commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood to confront her. The battle took place on December 13, 1939 and the British came out on top. The Graf Spee headed for the neutral harbor of Montevideo, Uruguay. They were given only a short time to effect repairs and the British did their best to make them believe a British fleet of 6 or 8 ships awaited them. Rather than chance the loss of his men, the German captain ordered the Graf Spee scuttled.

"53","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049516/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film opens with a brief lecture by Frank Baxter. He is a Professor of English at the University of Southern California. He explains that there are just a few areas left on Earth that are unknown and briefly describes a few theories that postulate there may be places deep under the surface of the Earth where man can survive.In Asia an archeological dig has discovered something. Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and Prof. Etienne Lafarge (Nestor Paiva) expose a stone tablet. They take it back to their tent to clean and examine it. We are introduced to Dr. Jud Bellamin (Hugh Beaumont) and Dr. Paul Stuart (Phil Chambers) who ask Bentley to translate the find: it may be related to the story of Gilgamesh and Ishtar. An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley. He cleans it and it is revealed to be an ancient oil lamp. The inscription is translated as a pre-biblical Noah's Ark story. The party of scientists set off for the mountain where the artifact originated before it was dislodged by the earthquake.They set up base camp and plan their final assault on the mountain the next day. A storm hits the base camp that evening. As they set off the next morning an avalanche brings down an arm from a statue. They continue climbing and discover the ruins of an ancient Sumarian civilization on a small plateau. They estimate the ruins are 5,000 years old. While Dr. Stuart walks around the ruins he falls down through an opening. The rest of the party goes down on ropes to save him. Bentley leads the way, followed by Lafarge, who is much older than the rest. Bellamin is third down the opening followed by Nazar (Rodd Redwing). After dropping down about 200 feet Bentley finds Stuart, but he died in the fall. Nazar notices a loose piton and hammers it secure, but that triggers a rockfall and he is killed and the three archeologists are trapped.They start searching for a way out, but Lafarge is experiencing breathing problems. He is also claustrophobic, They wander through the cave and discover a light source, which reveals a large underground city. They notice a very large tablet that informs them they have discovered the temple of Ishtar. They bed down for the night, but a lizard creature (a mole person?) digs up to the surface to spy on the three. A short time later, the party is attacked, sacks are placed over their heads, and they are pulled underground. They awake in a cave and Lafarge has claw marks on his chest. Two very pale white representative of the human underground civilization suddenly appear and direct they follow them. The scientists are escorted back to the city and presented to the High Priest, Ilinu (Alan Napier) who is performing a ritual. Ilinu immediately suspects the strangers and tells the king that they are evil. The king questions the three archeologists. At the conclusion of the questioning the high priest sentences them to death.The three escape into a cave, with guards in hot pursuit. Bentley shines his flashlight in the face of the First Officer (Robin Hughes) who cringes and retreats. It seems the light hurts their eyes. The three return to the city and shine their flashlight on the King and High Priest and they also retreat. The inhabitants of the city are albino, adapted to a world without sunlight. A lizard creature pulls the body of one of the guards underground. Seeing this, Lafarge panics and runs back into one of the caves. Bentley and Bellamin follow and discover a slave labor camp where the lizard creatures are forced to cultivate the food source--mushrooms. The guards whip their charges, which particularly incenses Bentley. Laforge is attacked and killed by a lizard creature, but is driven off by the flashlight before he can eat Laforge.Bentley and Bellamin return to the city and are met by the high priest along the way who tells them that they are welcome back to the city since they ""possess the divine fire of Ishtar"". The King is convinced they are holy messengers and are invited to a feast. One of the servers, Adad (Cynthia Patrick) drops her bowl of mushrooms, and is ordered whipped by the king. Bentley stops the punishment and is told not to interfere by the High Priest. Bentley helps her to her feet and notices she is not albino, but normally pigmented. The King presents Adad as a gift to Bentley. The High Priest explains that she is not human (like them) but a ""marked one"". The King and Priest further explain that when the population gets too large the excess are sacrificed in the fire of Ishtar.Bentley and Adad talk about their respective worlds as the High Priest spies on them. The next day Bentley and Bellamin tour the city. Meanwhile the High Priest meets with his fellow priests and plots to get the flashlight. This will show the king that the strangers are not divine, but mere mortals.Bentley and Bellamin intercede when three lizard creatures are being beaten, but their flashlight batteries begin to fail. They free the lizard creatures. Food production has been reduced because the lizard creatures are rebelling against their mistreatment. The High Priest schedules another sacrifice. After a ritual dance three women are escorted into a brightly lit chamber, enter, and are locked in. When they open the chamber later, the charred remains are carried out on stretchers. The High Priest is shown the dead body of Laforge. The High Priest was told by Bentley that Laforge was called back to Ishtar, reinforcing the story of his divinity. The High Priest shows the body to the king and explains that he is mortal and asks the King for permission to kill Bentley and Bellamin. The King agrees. Bentley and Bellamin are drugged and arrested. Elinu takes possession of the flashlight. Adad escapes and is captured by the lizard creatures. Bentley and Bellamin are taken to the lighted sacrifice chamber and locked in. The lizard creatures attack the city in force and kill the inhabitants, including the King and High Priest.The lizard creatures break open the sacrifice chamber, but the light repels them. Adad isn't afraid of the light and joins Bentley and Bellamin on their ascent back to their world. They reach the top and get into warmer clothes. Another earthquake strikes the area, and Adad is killed when a stone pillar crushes her. The underground city is buried.","
    
                    On an archaeological dig in Asia, Dr. Roger Bentley finds a cuneiform tablet referring to an ancient society, the Shadow Dynasty, that was destroyed. An earthquake soon after reveals an ancient artifact and the scientists discover the ruins of an ancient temple world on a remote mountain site. It leads them to an underground world, lost in time, where people have adapted to low light. The High Priest Elinu doesn't welcome the presence of the new arrivals and wants them eliminated.

                    Archaeologists discover a mountaintop temple which leads them to the further discovery an underground civilization of Sumerians, lost to time and among whom they become trapped. This unknown, centuries-old subterranean patriarchal society comprises a brutal albino master race (having, over time, lost their pigment in their nearly lightless world), soil burrowing mole people (a subjugated humanoid slave race that has lost both human appearance and the power of speech), and goats (for milk, clothing, and occasional meat). All subsist on mushrooms. Their enclosed cavern limits their numbers; so, when three unexplained strangers arrive (the archaeologists), the high priest calls for their quick execution. A flashlight - with its indefensible brightness in their dim world - thwarts that plan, and three maidens must instead be sacrificed to the Eye of Ishtar, a temple chamber where citizens and criminals burn to death. Every once in awhile, someone within this society will be born with ""the mark of darkness"" (a.k.a. pigment). Thus is the case with Adad (whom everyone calls Adel), a genetic throwback whom the Sumerians easily give their visitors (now regarded as godly messengers due to the flashlight) as their own personal slave woman. Their presence, however, soon destabilizes this society, and as the mole people rise up to carry out their long-overdue revolt, the archaeologists are sentenced to death under the Eye of Ishtar - which turns out to be exactly what they want, since it's merely a fissure to the outside world. Taking Adel with them (the only current Sumerian able to tolerate sunlight), they regain the mountaintop, only to encounter an earthquake (seemingly the wrath of the goddess Ishtar objecting to Adel's escape).

                    So it starts out with an archaeological team in the 50s that stumbles upon this underground civilization of a lost dynasty of Sumerians, who have apparently failed to evolve over the past 5,000 years (except into albinos). The plot becomes a but fuzzy here, but pretty much only three archaeologists survive. The albinos decide to sacrifice these strangers. One of them dies, but the other two (Dr. Bentley and Dr. Belamin) escape by shining a flashlight in the albinos and mole people's faces. Wait! Who are these mole people? They are mutant humanoid mole-type creatures that are the mistreated slaves of the albinos and resemble the sand people from Star Wars. Just like the albinos, living underground has made them highly sensitive to light. Anyways, the Sumerian priest believes that the flashlight is the sacred fire of their goddess, Ishtar. They come to believe that Bentley and Belamin are messengers of Ishtar and give Bentley a slave, a beautiful woman named Adel who is shunned by the albinos because of her tan skin. Of course, she and Bentley fall in love and he says she can come with him if they ever get out.

Alas, Burt escalates to such a level of anger and paranoia-- believing that Millie is in cahoots with his dad and ex-wife in the scam-- that he slaps Millie and ultimately tries to slam her typewriter on her, which lands on her hand.While Millie seeks treatment for her injuries from the beating, a doctor recommends that she should consult a psychiatrist about Burt. She goes to visit the pompous shrink, who insists that Burt needs months of institutionalization, regardless of whatever the hell is wrong with him. Millie remains faithful that somehow she will not need to make that choice.Within a short time though, Burt has such terrible episodes that Millie signs for him to be committed, and two guys in white jackets come to forcibly take him away to an asylum. While he is there, the authorities subject him to multiple shock treatments and force abundant drugs into him, and Millie waits for months with a guilty conscience, worrying that Burt will not be cured, and accepting that if he is, he will no longer want to be married to her.After the many months go by, Millie is ordered to pick up Burt at the sanitarium, but she only wants to appear briefly to release him and wish him well as he moves on. When they meet, Millie blathers on again for some time about how she is too old for him, and now that he is well he can get on in life with a younger woman. As she walks him off the grounds, he asks her to show him the hand that he smashed with the typewriter-- an incident he had repressed in his previous mania. She lifts her hand and he kisses it, then they deeply kiss each other. Someone walking by gives them a long critical look, which they notice, but they agree they do not care what other people think.They walk off into the falling autumn leaves (with Nat King Cole singing along).","

Alas, Burt escalates to such a level of anger and paranoia-- believing that Millie is in cahoots with his dad and ex-wife in the scam-- that he slaps Millie and ultimately tries to slam her typewriter on her, which lands on her hand.While Millie seeks treatment for her injuries from the beating, a doctor recommends that she should consult a psychiatrist about Burt. She goes to visit the pompous shrink, who insists that Burt needs months of institutionalization, regardless of whatever the hell is wrong with him. Millie remains faithful that somehow she will not need to make that choice.Within a short time though, Burt has such terrible episodes that Millie signs for him to be committed, and two guys in white jackets come to forcibly take him away to an asylum. While he is there, the authorities subject him to multiple shock treatments and force abundant drugs into him, and Millie waits for months with a guilty conscience, worrying that Burt will not be cured, and accepting that if he is, he will no longer want to be married to her.After the many months go by, Millie is ordered to pick up Burt at the sanitarium, but she only wants to appear briefly to release him and wish him well as he moves on. When they meet, Millie blathers on again for some time about how she is too old for him, and now that he is well he can get on in life with a younger woman. As she walks him off the grounds, he asks her to show him the hand that he smashed with the typewriter-- an incident he had repressed in his previous mania. She lifts her hand and he kisses it, then they deeply kiss each other. Someone walking by gives them a long critical look, which they notice, but they agree they do not care what other people think.They walk off into the falling autumn leaves (with Nat King Cole singing along).

And, it is the case of Fred Staples, a comparatively youthful industrial engineer brought in by Ramsey to succeed Briggs. The younger man's views and sensitivities are essentially the same as Briggs'. People are not merely units, they feel. But it is Ramsey's calculated pattern not to fire his aging aide but to create such untenable positions that he will be forced to resign.

                    The true story of airman Douglas Bader who overcame the loss of both legs in a 1931 flying accident to become a successful fighter pilot and wing leader during World War II.

                    Biopic of the famed British World War II flyer, Sir Douglas Bader. He joined the RAF in 1928 and easily took to flying, perhaps too easily as his commanders are concerned at the risks he takes with his aircraft. After a nasty crash in 1931, he loses both of his legs above the knee. After a long convalescence and learning to walk again with artificial legs, he returns to flying school where he again passes. The RAF forcibly retires him however due to his presumed disability. With the onset of World War II, Bader is re-instated and is given command of a fighter squadron. He survives the Battle of Britain but is shot down over enemy territory in 1941 losing one of his artificial legs. He was a POW and the RAF even sent a new leg to replace the one he lost. Known as a problem prisoner because of his numerous attempts to escape, he was transferred to Coldiz for much of his time, until the end of war.

Lt. R. Chasen is dictating his report of the case and tells the story of the Indestructible Man in flashback.We are outside the gates at San Quentin prison in California. This is the final stop for Charles ""Butcher"" Benton (Lon Chaney, Jr.); he is scheduled for execution in the gas chamber the next day. He is visited by his attorney, Paul Lowe (Ross Elliott). Lowe tells Benton his appeal was unsuccessful. Benton, while not surprised, is angry. He calls him a liar and a double crosser. Benton was part of a gang that stole $600,000 in an armored car robbery that Lowe masterminded. Two of his accomplices turned state's evidence, at the urging of Lowe. But Benton hid the money from his gang, and Lowe wants it. He tries to convince Benton to give it to him, but Benton vows to take revenge on all involved and take the location of the money to the grave.Down in Los Angeles, in a seedy bar, Joe Marcelli (Ken Terrell) and Squeamy Ellis (Marvin Ellis) are having a drink and listening to the radio report of Benton's pending execution. In his office at police headquarters, Lt. Chasen (Max Showalter, credited as Casey Adams) is reading the local paper when Capt. John Lauder (Stuart Randall) enters his office. Chasen is told that with Benton's execution the case is being marked as closed and he will be reassigned. Chasen spent a year on the case and is not happy to have it end without the recovery of the money. He vows to continue working on the case on his own time, as he is convinced Lowe was the mastermind.Chasen pays a visit to the local strip club to talk to Eva Martin (Marian Carr), the ""girlfriend"" of Benton's, hoping to get some information. Eva informs him that she and Benton were not involved. He was seeing her roommate, and when the roommate left town, she and Benton just struck up a friendship. She is emphatic that she was unaware of his criminal past and any knowledge of the robbery. Satisfied, he exits the club. He notices Lowe walking towards the club. He pretends to have his shoes shined while hiding behind a magazine so he can spy on Lowe. Lowe enters the club, walks upstairs and enters Eva's dressing room. The time is 5:00 p.m. and Benton has been executed. Eva feels bad for Benton and retrieves a letter he left for her in case he was executed. But before she can examine the contents, she's called back to the stage for her finale. She leaves Lowe behind in the dressing room. He quickly opens the letter and finds a very cryptic map with an ""x"" marking the location of something. He palms the map and puts a $50 bill back in the envelope and seals it. We are told in voiceover that its a map of the sewer system and the location of the stolen money.In San Francisco, Dr. Bradshaw (Robert Shayne) a ""distinguished Biochemist is making preparations for a final experiment which he hoped would lead the way to a cure for cancer."" His assistant (Joe Flynn) arrives with the body of Benton. He procured the body from a local mortuary under questionable circumstances. Bradshaw prepares the body, takes a blood sample, and wheels him into the machine. He runs 287,000 volts through the body. They intend to dissect the body after the experiment. The voltage causes his heart to start beating. Bradshaw dismisses it as ""a shock reaction, it can't last."" They pull the body out of the machine. Bradshaw sends his assistant out for some medications while he examines the body. Benton begins to move, much to Bradshaw's astonishment. He appears alive and aware of his surroundings. He sits up, then stands, and then knocks Bradshaw out with a mere brush of his arm. We are told in voiceover that the voltage burned out his vocal chords, rendering Benton mute. The voltage increased his strength. In his bid to escape the lab he pushes a door off its hinges. Bradshaw wakes as Benton returns to the lab. Bradshaw tries to reason with Benton. His assistant returns, shocked that Benton was up and walking around. Bradshaw warns him that Benton is violent. Bradshaw tries to take a blood sample, but the needle bends; his skin is a solid mass of cells. Benton attacks and kills Bradshaw and his assistant. Benton decides he wants to return to Los Angeles and seek revenge on his three accomplices.Chasen returns to the strip club to see Eva again, but this time it is a social call. They go out on a date to a burger joint. She tells him her life story, he reciprocates. Chasen has been tailing Lowe, and eavesdropping on some of his phone conversations. He is intrigued by just one. He watches Joe Marcelli cross the street, on a pair of crutches, for a meeting with Lowe. In the bar, Joe gets into a confrontation with an old lush (Madge Cleveland) and Harry, the bar owner (Robert Foulk). Lowe has a job for him--to help him recover the money. They are to meet the next day.Benton is walking along a quiet road on his way back to Los Angeles, when he sees a beautiful woman (Rita Green) standing next to a car with a flat tire. As he approaches, Carnie (Eddie Marr) pops out and introduces himself. He tells Benton the car has a flat tire, and he has no tools to change it. Benton pushes the two aside and lifts the car up. Carnie replaces the tire and expresses interest in hiring Benton for his carnival act. Benton kills Carnie and steals the car and continues on his trek for Los Angeles. The police respond with roadblocks. When Benton encounters one, he attacks and kills the two policemen and continues on his way.The next morning Chasen reports in with the Captain. He is informed he and the rest of the force are going on 24-hour duty. Benton, back in Los Angeles, stops by the strip club to see Eva. Eva is shocked to see Benton. He shows her a tattoo to prove his identity. He sees his envelope and opens it. She explains that all it contained was a $50 bill and that Lowe was there when she opened it. Benton leaves and intends to get Squeamy and Joe. Eva calls the police. She asks for Chasen, but is told he is out. She leaves a message that Benton is alive. Immediately she calls Squeamy Ellis and tells him the same, but he doesn't believe her. He did think Benton arranged a hit man, so he takes the warning seriously enough to make arrangements for a quick escape from his apartment down the fire escape. Benton hops on Angels Flight funicular and rides up to Squeamy's apartment. When he hears Benton outside his room he makes good his escape. Eva arrives in time to see Benton at Squeamy's apartment window. Joe, unaware of Benton's escape, is on his way to see Squeamy. Having no money, he bypasses Angels Flight, and walks up the stairs on his crutches. Benton sees his prey from the window and leaves the apartment to confront him. Joe sees Benton just outside the apartment, and tries to escape, but his bad foot slows him down. Benton lifts him up and throws him down a flight of stairs, killing him instantly. The police arrive and shoot Benton, but with no effect at all. Benton kills the policeman.Next on his list is the attorney. He enters the Bradbury Building, and takes the elevator up to Lowe's office. He breaks in and disables the phone. Benton is delighted that Squeamy decides to visit Lowe at his office. As Ellis exits the elevator, Benton is there waiting for him. Ellis empties his revolver into Benton then backs into the elevator. Benton grabs him, lifts him overhead, walks over to the railing and tosses him down five stories to the lobby below. When Eva arrives at the Bradbury Building she sees a crowd gathered around the body of Squeamy Ellis. A short time later, Launer and Chasen arrive and are told the killer must have been wearing a bullet-proof vest. Launer and Chasen are told of a reported sighting of Benton in the Valley. They question a woman (Marjorie Stapp). She describes Benton and the murder of her boyfriend.When Lowe hears a radio report in his car about the death of Joe and that Benton was identified as the killer he stops by the strip club to see Eva. Eva isn't there, but Francine (Peggy Maley) is filling in for her. Francine tells Lowe that Eva is at Police Headquarters. Lowe drives over to the station, and Eva tells him both Joe and Squeamy are dead and Benton is alive. Lowe immediately demands police protection. Chasen demands to know where the money is located. To guarantee his own safety, Lowe provokes arrest by slugging the Sergeant (Roy Engle).Chasen devises a plan to get Lowe to speak. He intends to release him from custody and let Benton track him down. Captain Launer is very reluctant to approve, but finally agrees to the plan. It works and Lowe talks. That leads them to the sewers and the exact location of the money. Benton has been traveling around in the Los Angeles storm drains as the police zeroed in on his exact location. They were advised that a flamethrower might be an effective weapon. Benton locates the money and starts stuffing it into his coat. One police officer shoots him with a bazooka, but it only slows him down a little. Launer recovers the money from the strongbox. When next he is spotted they employ the flamethrower. Other than melting his face a little, it has no effect on stopping him. Benton makes his way to the power station and commandeers a gantry crane. The crane brushes against a large transformer and a surge of electricity passes through the crane killing Benton.Back in Chasen's office, he finishes up his report and closes the case. He asks the Captain for a little time off. Chasen and Eva are back at the burger joint in his car on a date. He informs her he had arranged her dismissal from her job. He tells her being his wife will take up all her time. They kiss.","
    
                    ""Butcher"" Benton goes to his death in the state prison, cursing the three men who double-crossed him following an armored-car hold-up; ""Squeamy"" Ellis, Joe Marcelli and Paul Lowe, his attorney and leader of the gang. He vows to return and kill them and dies without revealing the location of the stolen money. Detective Chasen is determined to keep working on the case until the stolen loot is recovered. Benton's body is taken to Professor Bradshaw and his assistant for experimentation, and they manage to restore him to life, making him practically indestructible in the process. He takes off after the three men, getting rid of everybody who stands in his way. He is impervious to police bullets. He kills Ellis and Marcelli, while Lowe seeks police protection. Benton takes to the sewers to recover the hidden loot and the police are powerless to stop him.

                    Opportunistic con man, Dan Kehoe, is on the run when he stops off at a small town saloon and hears stories of the four notorious McDade Brothers. Three of the career outlaws were killed on their last job while one escaped... his identity unknown. Hearing that their $50,000 cache of stolen gold is hidden somewhere on the family ranch at Wagon Mount, Kehoe ignores warnings about their feisty mother, who dislikes visitors and is a crack shot, and ingratiates himself with the old woman with a phony story about meeting her surviving son in a jail cell. He also uses his charm on the four beautiful man-hungry McDade widows, who have stayed with their cantankerous mother-in-law for the past two years - each hoping that her husband is the surviving son and sole claimant to the money.

                    In the late 20's, the talkative newly graduated in pharmacy and aspirant piano player Eddy Duchin comes from Boston to New York expecting to play with the orchestra of Leo Reisman at fancy New York's Central Park Casino. However he had misunderstood the invitation of the maestro and while leaving the place, he meets the wealthy socialite Marjorie Oelrichs that asks Leo Reisman to give a chance to Eddy. He plays in the intermission and becomes a successful piano showman. Two years later, Marjorie and Eddy get married and in the Christmas, Marjorie has a baby, Peter, but she dies after the delivery.

                    In the early 1930s, Bostonian Eddy Duchin, just having graduated from pharmacy school, decides instead to go to New York City to pursue his dream of becoming a rich and famous pianist, especially as he has a standing job offer from band leader Leo Reisman to play in his band which performs at the Central Park Casino. Reisman had heard Eddy's makeshift band play while Eddy was still in college. Despite Eddy's easy-going performing style and natural charisma on stage, the job offer is not as he believes. Eddy does, however, manage to rise to professional musical renown with the help of who becomes his biggest booster, New York socialite and interior designer Marjorie Oelrichs, who works because she does not want to be beholden to easy money. But Eddy's life in New York does not end up as he wants due primarily to a personal tragedy. He runs away from everything associated with that tragedy, which he believes was his own doing. It becomes easier to do so with the onset of WWII. But when Eddy decides to embrace life again - especially one specific outcome of that tragedy - Eddy finds that it is not as easy as he would like. He may be able to understand how to find that happiness he so desires the second time around with the help of Englishwoman, ""Chiquita"" Wynn, unless...

                    Tom Lee is a sensitive boy of 17 whose lack of interest in the ""manly"" pursuits of sports, mountain climbing and girls labels him ""sister-boy"" at the college he is attending. Head master Bill Reynold's wife Laura sees Tom's suffering at the hands of his school mates (and her husband), and tries to help him find himself.

                    At his ten year reunion, Tom Lee reminisces about his life at Chilton, a boys' prep school. Chilton is the type of institution where generations from the same family attend, and want to attend. Tom, however, has different thoughts. He was perceived as different than the other boys, who called him sister-boy. He doesn't join in the group sporting activities except tennis, a sport he plays with finesse rather than power; he knows how to sew and cook; he knows all about gardening; he wants to be a folk musician; he's only accepted into the dramatic club if he plays the women's roles; and he even doesn't walk or style his hair like the others. The only one of his classmates who tries to understand him is his roommate, Al Thompson, who feels he can only do so much as one person against the masses. Tom knows that he embarrasses his alumnus father, Herb Lee, who is worried the Lee name will now be forever tainted at Chilton. At Chilton, Tom's favorite times are spent with Laura Reynolds, the relatively recent bride of his dormitory house master, the overtly masculine Bill Reynolds who also attended Chilton as a student at the same time as Herb Lee. Seeing the torment he is facing from all sides, Laura wants to help Tom in any way she can. As time goes on and things don't get any better for Tom, Laura comes to the realization of why she is trying so desperately to help him and what she needs to do both to accomplish that task and be true to herself.

A fight breaks out as the two crews change over.In another part of the installation the main office is informed that mine number 8 has filled with water. One of the engineers Shigeru Kwamura (Kenji Sahara) goes down to investigate; the last survey didnt reveal any problems. When he arrives at the shaft he discovers two of the miners are trapped by the waterShigeru calls for a couple of volunteers and they head down the tunnel to rescue the men. Yoshi is the first one found; he appears unconscious and close to death. Hes quickly rushed to the hospital and the doctors are concerned about a strange head wound they have found.There is no news about the other man, Goro. Some of the miners think Goro tried to kill Yoshi because of the earlier fight in the assembly area. Leaving the hospital Shigeru encounters his girlfriend Kiyo (Yumi Shirakawa) who is also Goro's sister. She fears the stories of his crime are true bit Shirakawa insists that she wait till more information is availableBack in the flooded tunnel the search for Goro goes on. One of the men thinks they hear something and investigate. Getting closer to the source of the noise they hear other strange sounds. Suddenly two of the men are dragged below the water but a third escapes. He tries to phone for help but is killed.Later the bodies of the three men are recovered. They seem to have suffered the same injuries as Yoshi. The doctor seems to doubt Goro could have committed the murders; the strength involved would be beyond anything he was capable of.That night Shigeru goes and comforts Kiyo as rumors spread through the village about her brother. As they sit and talk a huge caterpillar like creature crashes into the house, the couple escape and summon the police. They confront the creature but a forced back.The village is alerted to the danger and the mine workers go to try and stem the threat. They spot the creature climbing a hill outside the village and head off in pursuit. Thinking they have the creature cornered they open fire, with little effect. The creature attacks two of the men and kills them, but in the process it loses its footing and slides down the hill into darkness and escapes.Later it is reported the creature was seen entering one of the older mine shafts. The police begin sealing the entrance as they wait for the military to arrive. A detachment of soldiers arrives and confidently enters the tunnel in search of the creature. Finding Goro's body they set up a machine gun while the creature advances. Despite their best efforts the creature continues to advance. Shigeru hits on the idea of sending one of the mine trains into the tunnel. At first his plan seems to work but the creature revives. The machine gun opens fire again causing a cave in that traps Shigeru and apparently kill the creature.Later Professor Kashiwagi arrives and reviews the evidence. He believes the creature is a ""meganuron"", the nymph of a dragonfly, possibly hatched from an egg buried somehow in the mineAn earthquake hits the area and substantial sections of the local mountains subside destroying the only road to the mines. Amid one of the landslides, Shigeru is found, dazed and with a broken arm. At the hospital Shigeru appears non responsive as if in some kind of shock. A doctor suggests he is suffering from amnesia The doctors try to trigger his memory by showing him images of the monster he may have encountered in the mine.At the same time an air force pilot encounters a UFO and as he is pursuing it he informs his base that the object is performing incredible manuvers. Unfortunately as the pilot is chasing the object it does a sharp u-turn and flies so close that the plane breaks up and the only things recovered are his oxygen mask and bloody helmet. They then are informed that a BOAC flight was also attacked by the UFO and was destroyed leaving no survivors. Soon there are reports of the UFO attacking various cities throughout Asia; including Beijing and Manilla.Back in Kyushu, two honeymooners head off for a trip after being recently married. Both are friends of Sunagawa, the seismologist who first informed Kashiwagi and the authorities of the mysterious new activity at Mt. Aso. They stop at a volcanic crater and begin photographing each other, when suddenly a bird-like creature flies low overhead killing them instantly. The camera the couple where using is retrieved and an image of the creature has been captured.The next day the police and Kashiwagi question Sunagawa about his friend and as they are talking to him one of the lab attendants come out with the freshly developed roll and as they are looking at it they see a mysterious shadow and when they make a print of it they see that it is the wing tip of a gigantic bird. Kashiwagi, who happened to have some pictures with him from his recent visit to Shigeru, takes out the drawing of a pteranadon and compares it to the pic and it is almost identical. However, Kashiwagi knows that Shigeru is the key and he is the one who can tell the authorities what he saw.At the hospital Shigeru has a breakthrough when his girlfriend shows him a nest with eggs hatching. He begins to recall seeing a nest with large numbers of odd creatures as well as one giant egg off by itself. As he watches the egg hatches and a Rodan is born. It immediately begins eating the other creatures in the cave. The scientists return to the mineshaft to try and gather more information, if what Shigeru says is correct they should be in no danger from the caterpillar-like creatures, and they believe Rodan has left the nest. They return to the spot indicated by Shigeru and find a piece of eggshell before having to leave due to a cave in.They study the shell fragment and discover the original egg was massive. At a briefing they give details of the size of a fully grown Rodan. Its wingspan should be upwards of 270 meters and have a body weight in excess of 100 tons. Aside from the danger of being eaten they realize the sonic boom created when the creature flies will be fatal to huge numbers of people.Professor Kashiwagi goes on to explain that he believes Rodan now exists because of atomic tests. He explains that radioactive rainwater may have seeped into the underground caverns and caused a mutation. He then suggests a probable search area based around the two mines that had suffered previous attacksFollowing up on the lead the army sends a team to investigate. They witness Rodan breaking through to the surface and taking flight. His supersonic flight is as dangerous as predicted and he destroys a vehicle trying to fleeThe Japanese Air Force attempt to intercept the creature and a dog fight ensues but Rodan clearly out flies the pilots destroying a number of aircraft in the process.Alarms sound in nearby towns as Rodan flies off and the jets try to keep up. The jets close on the creature and seem to shoot it down.

Some of the men sent to investigate are killed but one who has managed to escape brings back a tale of a giant insect. Soon, the giant prehistoric insects are attacking the village. Not long after, something traveling faster than the speed of sound is found flying in the sky. It is Rodan, a giant flying prehistoric reptile that has come to life. It spreads terror throughout Japan and is seemingly invincible to any weapon they may throw at it.

Soon more bodies turn up and the main suspect is Goro. However, one night while Shigeru is visiting his fiancée Kiyo, Goro's sister, a giant caterpillar like monster crashes through her house. Immediately, the authorities realize that Goro is not to blame but the monsters are. Shigeru and the authorities then go back in the mine and track down the monster. While in the mine, they also find Goro's body and while they attempt to free Goro's body, a landslide occurs trapping Shigeru in an adjoining cavern. A few days later Shigeru is found but he is in a state of shock caused by the fact that he saw an even more terrible creature, a flying reptile called Rodan, hatch from its egg. Soon the world finds out about the creature and the world is now on alert as they await for this terrible monster to attack.

Three cowboys or vaqueros approach working around cactus. They spot cattle tracks and follow. A narrator explains, ""Deep in the back country of Mexico there rises a grim and mysterious mountain, which is said to be hollow. Its interior has never been explored because at its base lies an impassible swamp. The superstitious link the hollow mountain and the swamp and their folk legends as places of evil, great evil. They tell of the strange animal from the dawn of creation that inhabits the area, coming forth to prowl and pillage only in time of drought. They tell of men and cattle disappearing without trace. But perhaps these are only tales. Tales told by simple people."" The three men continue to follow the cattle tracks. One cowboy voices his concern about the area, but is accused of being superstitious. Felipe Sanchez (Carlos Rivas) searches on foot in one direction, while his ranch partner, Jimmy Ryan (Guy Madison) in the other. The third man remains behind with the horses and is spooked by the strange animal noises. Felipe manages to get trapped in the swamp, but is rescued by Jimmy. Jimmy discovers one of his dead cows in the quicksand.Panchito (Mario Navarro) is waiting outside the town cantina. His very drunk father, Pancho (Pascual Garcia Pena) finally walks outside to greet his son. They mount the horse to ride home, but troublesome kids throw firecrackers spooking the horse which bucks the pair off. Unfortunately, Pancho still has a foot in one of the stirrups and is dragged down the street. Jimmy sees the commotion and stops the runaway horse. Sarita (Patricia Medina) comes to check on Pancho and the boy. Pancho works for her father. Jimmy and Sarita walk to the house.At Sarita's house, out on the patio, Margarita (Lupe Carriles) is serving Don Pedro (Julio Villarreal) refreshments when Jimmy and Sarita arrive. Jimmy tells Don Pedro that three times in the last month he has had cattle disappear or stolen. The only one found was drown in the swamp. Don Enrique Rios (Eduardo Noriega) pays a visit to see Don Pedro. Enrique tells Jimmy to go back to Texas. They get into a verbal exchange and are reminded by Don Pedro they are both guests.At Rancho Bonito, the spread owned jointly by Jimmy and Felipe, they rise to find their crew of men have quit. Pancho and Panchito have come to the ranch to offer their services. Jimmy and Felipe are not particularly anxious to have a drunk and a little boy as ranch hands, but they need the help and reluctantly agree. Sarita arrives and tries to convince Pancho and his son return to her employment, but she is unsuccessful. She rides out to apologize to Jimmy. She explains that she intends to marry Enrique. Sarita's horse escapes, so Jimmy insists on riding with her back to town on his horse. Enrique is in town and sees his betrothed with Jimmy. Enrique is enraged and jealous and attacks Jimmy. He pulls his gun, but Jimmy is faster on the draw. They agree to a fistfight to settle things. The street market is a mess when they finish, but Jimmy walks away the winner with a few cuts and bruises. He retrieves his telegram that had been knocked from his hand and is happy to read, ""Price of your cattle agreeable to us.

Don Pedro stops by to tell Jimmy and Felipe that Enrique wants to buy their ranch, cattle and all, and before the June 10 delivery date. The pair tell Don Pedro the ranch is not for sale. Don Pedro is distressed, as he knows Enrique is not one to take a refusal graciously. Enrique stops by to see Sarita at her home to find out why she was with Jimmy. They reconcile and she reassures him she is still in love with him.Jimmy, Felipe, Pancho and Panchito are out riding and discover an abandoned ranch house near the swamp near Hollow Mountain. Pancho explains that the owner disappeared when the swamp started to dry up. Jimmy briefly explores the empty house and determines that it was abandoned. The three men leave the little boy, Panchito, to guard the horses at the abandoned ranch house. They walk into the swamp area and find another dead cow.

Enrique hires two thugs and gives them instructions, to which we are not privy. Jimmy goes to the bank for a loan, but since Enrique's influence is strong, the loan is refused. The banker does acknowledge that Enrique has a great influence and tells Jimmy, ""You have made enemies."" The two thugs have volunteered to work for Jimmy and Felipe for double payment after the cattle are sold.At their ranch, Jimmy is feeding an orphaned calf. He gets a note, ""Must see you immediately. Meet me at the graveyard. Sarita."" Pancho and his son go to the abandoned ranch house. Pancho goes off to the mountain to explore. He instructs Panchito to stay at the abandoned ranch house with the horses. Jimmy goes to the graveyard to see Sarita. She wants to know why he didn't sell to Enrique. She also tells Jimmy she is to be married the next day. Pancho explores the swamp area looking for Jimmy's cattle. He encounters something large and fires his gun at the menace. It bellows and roars at this annoyance. He is attacked, and the camera pans over to his hat. Panchito waits, as instructed, until the light on a pole casts a shadow like a sundial on a rock.

They summon plutonium scientist Dr. Adam Royston (Dean Jagger) for advice as to what to do. When Royston has his own lab destroyed he surmises that the culprit was un-human, and when two soldiers guarding the large crevasse where the ground erupted disappear he understands that there is some chemical force at work. The Army decides to block up the ground with concrete but Royston knows that the force will come out for more radioactive material and prepares for it. When it is revealed by Dr. Royston that the monster is actually a mass of energy he gets ample resistance form the voice of reason, the Army generals at hand who decide to bomb the thing back to the center of the earth where it came from. In a final showdown with the force taking a horrible new form Royston and the Army fight for their lives.=============================================================================This is a more detailed synopsis.The movie opens with the credits and title over an open muddy field in Scotland. A soldier, in a radiation suit, holds a Geiger counter and walks searching for a buried sample. This is a military training exercise. The soldier, ""Spider"" Webb (Anthony Newley) finds the cylinder in a bit over a minute. As the soldiers are about to pack things in for the day, Lancing (Kenneth Cope) asks for a turn. Sgt. Grimsdyke (Michael Ripper) buries the sample. Haggis (Ian MacNaughton) and Webb gripe about the cold, the food and the delay. Lancing begins his search. Webb tries to help, but Landing has picked up a stronger radioactive source. Lt. Bannerman (Peter Hammond) takes the counter and tells Sgt. Grimsdyke to fetch Major Cartright. Major Cartright (John Harvey) pulls up in his Jeep and is escorted to the site of the strong radioactive reading. Lancing marks the location with a stick. Grimsdyke, Bannerman, and Cartright walk over to where the sample was buried. Lancing notices the water starting to bubble where he placed the stick. The ground begins to open and the surface water disappears. The other soldiers walk over to Lancing and are ordered back, but Lancing remains behind. The Sergeant orders a soldier (Edwin Richfield) to fetch Lancing. The earth splits open and a fireball shoots up. Lancing falls to the ground.In nearby Lochmouth, Scotland, an Atomic Energy Facility is processing nuclear materials--Cobalt. A Public Address announcement is made for Dr. Adam Royston. The director's son is working on cobalt sample readings. Peter Elliott (William Lucas) is substituting for Dr. Royston. Royston is down in his workshop some distance from the facility. The director, John Elliott (Edward Chapman) comes looking for Royston in person when Royston fails to respond to pages. Father and son have a philosophical difference as to the son's role at the facility.Dr. Adam Royston (Dean Jagger) tunes in a classical radio station behind a shield. He's conducting an experiment to use radio waves to rapidly counteract radioactive decay in certain chemical elements. Static on the radio indicates the chemical element is highly radioactive. A guard, Russell (Neil Wilson) comes to collect Royston. Royston walks back to the facility. The director makes it clear Royston is only to work on his assigned tasks, and not his own pet projects. He also reiterates that his son is to concentrate on administrative duties, not play scientist. He tells Royston the Army contacted them about ""a radiation reaction."" He sends Royston to check it out, much to Royston's annoyance.Royston drives down to the War Department test site and takes Geiger readings. They are all negative. He tells the Major he wants to see the injured soldiers. Lancing is the most seriously burned. Royston immediately recognizes the type of burn. Next he examines the other soldier. His back is seriously blistered and the skin is peeling away. The unburned area corresponds to his rifle slung over his shoulder. These are radiation burns.That night the Army returns with equipment Royston requested, including lights. We learn Lancing has since died of his wounds. Royston requests the presence of the Major. He tells the Major, ""There's nothing more we can do out here. I suggest you leave a couple of men on guard."" Royston and Peter drive back to the atomic facility and discuss the clues.Two boys out for the evening are planning a little frolic. One dares the other to go to an old keep or tower and see ""Old Tom."" Willie Harding (Michael Brooke) sets off for the tower. He slowly and furtively creeps through the underbrush. He spots the tower and approaches. Then he sees something. His eyes widen in horror and he backs away then runs back to his friend, Ian Osborn (Frazer Hines). Willie was severely burned and is now in hospital. Royston is there with the doctor to examine the burns. Dr. Kelly (Robert Bruce) suspected radiation and explains that's why he called Royston. Kelly and Royston go talk to the parents. He asks Jack Harding (Jameson Clark) and his wife Vi (Jane Aird) the circumstances. They tell Royston to talk to the boy, Ian. Royston stops at the church after services to question Ian. Ian is reluctant at first to discuss their little adventure, but finally tells him exactly where it happened. Royston drives out to the tower. An old moonshiner occupies the place. Royston brings his Geiger counter. He notices a soot-like substance on the floor and a liquid dripping through the ceiling. He finds a still and Old Tom (Norman Macowan) sleeping. Royston spots a radioactive sample bottle on the shelf. It is from his workshop. He tests it and discovers it is now inert.Back at Royston's lab the place shows signs of a burglary. Glass is broken and equipment is damaged. There is a strange soot-like substance everywhere. Peter arrives to find Royston going through the damage. Royston explains the container contains tritium with a half-life of 28 years. Now the sample is inert.Inspector McGill (Leo McKern) meets with the director, John Elliott. Because a crime involves radiation, McGill is required to investigate. He meets with Royston in the cafeteria. McGill asks about the child who was burned. He already talked to Old Tom and confirmed the child never touched the container. McGill asks Royston to help him investigate. Willie Harding dies shortly after admission to hospital. Dr. Kelly pronounces and consoles the parents. Royston and McGill arrive and talk to Dr. Kelly. Jack Harding confronts Royston. He tells him, ""You meddle with things that kill, like they killed my boy in there. You should be locked up. You're not safe, you're a murderer.""A lab technician, Harry Unwin (Neil Hallett) exits the radiation treatment room and calls a girl for a little assignation. He notices static on the phone line. Willie's body is removed from his room. The girl, Zena (Marianne Brauns) arrives and they kiss. Harry notices the equipment start on its own. A strong static sound alerts Harry that something is in the room. He retreats cowering against the wall. Zena, safe in another room, sees it through the glass shielding and screams. We zoom in on Harry's hand. His fingers are swelling and blistering. His face melts like wax revealing his teeth. The hospital director (Max Brimmell) shows Royston and McGill the lab. The storage vault is melted and covered in the same soot-like substance. Royston announces, ""Obviously the radium was the target."" Royston concludes it can assume any shape. It can come under a door or through a ventilation grill. McGill tells Royston that the Major posted soldiers at the origin point--the fissure.Haggis and Webb are on guard at the fissure. Haggis hears something. He sees a glow out by the fissure. He ventures to have a look. He calls to Spider Webb then screams. Webb goes out to rescue his friend and finds his rifle covered with soot. He hears the buzzing or static sound and fires his machine gun at it. He screams and falls down. Royston, McGill, and the Major drive up and investigate. The major finds a torn cap.At the atomic facility, Royston calls a meeting to brainstorm. He proposes that the creature lives underground and is intelligent. About every fifty years a greater pull on the earth happens because of planetary alignment. To live it needs energy and fifty years ago there was nothing on the surface to eat. But now there is. In Royston's lab and the hospital there are radioactive isotopes. The director is not convinced. He calls the hypothesis ""absolute rubbish."" McGill wants to see the thing at the fissure.The military makes all the arrangements and provides the equipment. Peter volunteers to go down into the fissure. On the way down he discovers the uniform and skeletal remains of one of the soldiers on a ledge. He continues down, but now his Geiger reacts. He sees it and demands to be pulled out fast. They get him to the car and McGill asks, ""Peter what did you see down there?"" Peter breathlessly replies, ""I don't know what it was. It is something out of a nightmare. It was horrible."" The Major tells Royston his orders are to kill the thing, and then concrete over the fissure. They employ napalm then detonate explosives and cover it in concrete.Royston is back in his lab working. McGill stops in for a chat and tells him what the Army did. Royston is dubious that will stop the thing. He asks, ""How do you kill mud?"" McGill is leaving for London. Royston tells McGill of his pet project, namely, the ability to disintegrate atomic structure without the explosion.

                    British Army radiation drills at a remote Scottish base attract a subterranean, radioactive entity of unknown nature that vanishes, leaving two severely radiation-burned soldiers... and a ""bottomless"" crack in the earth. Others who meet the thing in the night suffer likewise, and with increasing severity; it seems to be able to ""absorb"" radiation from any source, growing bigger and bigger. What is it?? How do you destroy a thing that ""feeds"" on energy?

    Synopsis
    While going through some routine practice training inScotlandfor mine detection a group of soldiers detects a large radioactive signal just before the ground opens up in an explosive eruption. They summon plutonium scientist Dr. Adam Royston (Dean Jagger) for advice as to what to do. When Royston has his own lab destroyed he surmises that the culprit was un-human, and when two soldiers guarding the large crevasse where the ground erupted disappear he understands that there is some chemical force at work. The Army decides to block up the ground with concrete but Royston knows that the force will come out for more radioactive material and prepares for it. When it is revealed by Dr. Royston that the monster is actually a mass of energy he gets ample resistance form the voice of reason, the Army generals at hand who decide to bomb the thing back to the center of the earth where it came from. In a final showdown with the force taking a horrible new form Royston and the Army fight for their lives.=============================================================================This is a more detailed synopsis.The movie opens with the credits and title over an open muddy field in Scotland. A soldier, in a radiation suit, holds a Geiger counter and walks searching for a buried sample. This is a military training exercise. The soldier, ""Spider"" Webb (Anthony Newley) finds the cylinder in a bit over a minute. As the soldiers are about to pack things in for the day, Lancing (Kenneth Cope) asks for a turn. Sgt. Grimsdyke (Michael Ripper) buries the sample. Haggis (Ian MacNaughton) and Webb gripe about the cold, the food and the delay. Lancing begins his search. Webb tries to help, but Landing has picked up a stronger radioactive source. Lt. Bannerman (Peter Hammond) takes the counter and tells Sgt. Grimsdyke to fetch Major Cartright. Major Cartright (John Harvey) pulls up in his Jeep and is escorted to the site of the strong radioactive reading. Lancing marks the location with a stick. Grimsdyke, Bannerman, and Cartright walk over to where the sample was buried. Lancing notices the water starting to bubble where he placed the stick. The ground begins to open and the surface water disappears. The other soldiers walk over to Lancing and are ordered back, but Lancing remains behind. The Sergeant orders a soldier (Edwin Richfield) to fetch Lancing. The earth splits open and a fireball shoots up. Lancing falls to the ground.In nearby Lochmouth, Scotland, an Atomic Energy Facility is processing nuclear materials--Cobalt. A Public Address announcement is made for Dr. Adam Royston. The director's son is working on cobalt sample readings. Peter Elliott (William Lucas) is substituting for Dr. Royston. Royston is down in his workshop some distance from the facility. The director, John Elliott (Edward Chapman) comes looking for Royston in person when Royston fails to respond to pages. Father and son have a philosophical difference as to the son's role at the facility.Dr. Adam Royston (Dean Jagger) tunes in a classical radio station behind a shield. He's conducting an experiment to use radio waves to rapidly counteract radioactive decay in certain chemical elements. Static on the radio indicates the chemical element is highly radioactive. A guard, Russell (Neil Wilson) comes to collect Royston. Royston walks back to the facility. The director makes it clear Royston is only to work on his assigned tasks, and not his own pet projects. He also reiterates that his son is to concentrate on administrative duties, not play scientist. He tells Royston the Army contacted them about ""a radiation reaction."" He sends Royston to check it out, much to Royston's annoyance.Royston drives down to the War Department test site and takes Geiger readings. They are all negative. He tells the Major he wants to see the injured soldiers. Lancing is the most seriously burned. Royston immediately recognizes the type of burn. Next he examines the other soldier. His back is seriously blistered and the skin is peeling away. The unburned area corresponds to his rifle slung over his shoulder. These are radiation burns.That night the Army returns with equipment Royston requested, including lights. We learn Lancing has since died of his wounds. Royston requests the presence of the Major. He tells the Major, ""There's nothing more we can do out here. I suggest you leave a couple of men on guard."" Royston and Peter drive back to the atomic facility and discuss the clues.Two boys out for the evening are planning a little frolic. One dares the other to go to an old keep or tower and see ""Old Tom."" Willie Harding (Michael Brooke) sets off for the tower. He slowly and furtively creeps through the underbrush. He spots the tower and approaches. Then he sees something. His eyes widen in horror and he backs away then runs back to his friend, Ian Osborn (Frazer Hines). Willie was severely burned and is now in hospital. Royston is there with the doctor to examine the burns. Dr. Kelly (Robert Bruce) suspected radiation and explains that's why he called Royston. Kelly and Royston go talk to the parents. He asks Jack Harding (Jameson Clark) and his wife Vi (Jane Aird) the circumstances. They tell Royston to talk to the boy, Ian. Royston stops at the church after services to question Ian. Ian is reluctant at first to discuss their little adventure, but finally tells him exactly where it happened. Royston drives out to the tower. An old moonshiner occupies the place. Royston brings his Geiger counter. He notices a soot-like substance on the floor and a liquid dripping through the ceiling. He finds a still and Old Tom (Norman Macowan) sleeping. Royston spots a radioactive sample bottle on the shelf. It is from his workshop. He tests it and discovers it is now inert.Back at Royston's lab the place shows signs of a burglary. Glass is broken and equipment is damaged. There is a strange soot-like substance everywhere. Peter arrives to find Royston going through the damage. Royston explains the container contains tritium with a half-life of 28 years. Now the sample is inert.Inspector McGill (Leo McKern) meets with the director, John Elliott. Because a crime involves radiation, McGill is required to investigate. He meets with Royston in the cafeteria. McGill asks about the child who was burned. He already talked to Old Tom and confirmed the child never touched the container. McGill asks Royston to help him investigate. Willie Harding dies shortly after admission to hospital. Dr. Kelly pronounces and consoles the parents. Royston and McGill arrive and talk to Dr. Kelly. Jack Harding confronts Royston. He tells him, ""You meddle with things that kill, like they killed my boy in there. You should be locked up. You're not safe, you're a murderer.""A lab technician, Harry Unwin (Neil Hallett) exits the radiation treatment room and calls a girl for a little assignation. He notices static on the phone line. Willie's body is removed from his room. The girl, Zena (Marianne Brauns) arrives and they kiss. Harry notices the equipment start on its own. A strong static sound alerts Harry that something is in the room. He retreats cowering against the wall. Zena, safe in another room, sees it through the glass shielding and screams. We zoom in on Harry's hand. His fingers are swelling and blistering. His face melts like wax revealing his teeth. The hospital director (Max Brimmell) shows Royston and McGill the lab. The storage vault is melted and covered in the same soot-like substance. Royston announces, ""Obviously the radium was the target."" Royston concludes it can assume any shape. It can come under a door or through a ventilation grill. McGill tells Royston that the Major posted soldiers at the origin point--the fissure.Haggis and Webb are on guard at the fissure. Haggis hears something. He sees a glow out by the fissure. He ventures to have a look. He calls to Spider Webb then screams. Webb goes out to rescue his friend and finds his rifle covered with soot. He hears the buzzing or static sound and fires his machine gun at it. He screams and falls down. Royston, McGill, and the Major drive up and investigate. The major finds a torn cap.At the atomic facility, Royston calls a meeting to brainstorm. He proposes that the creature lives underground and is intelligent. About every fifty years a greater pull on the earth happens because of planetary alignment. To live it needs energy and fifty years ago there was nothing on the surface to eat. But now there is. In Royston's lab and the hospital there are radioactive isotopes. The director is not convinced. He calls the hypothesis ""absolute rubbish."" McGill wants to see the thing at the fissure.The military makes all the arrangements and provides the equipment. Peter volunteers to go down into the fissure. On the way down he discovers the uniform and skeletal remains of one of the soldiers on a ledge. He continues down, but now his Geiger reacts. He sees it and demands to be pulled out fast. They get him to the car and McGill asks, ""Peter what did you see down there?"" Peter breathlessly replies, ""I don't know what it was. It is something out of a nightmare. It was horrible."" The Major tells Royston his orders are to kill the thing, and then concrete over the fissure. They employ napalm then detonate explosives and cover it in concrete.Royston is back in his lab working. McGill stops in for a chat and tells him what the Army did. Royston is dubious that will stop the thing. He asks, ""How do you kill mud?"" McGill is leaving for London. Royston tells McGill of his pet project, namely, the ability to disintegrate atomic structure without the explosion. McGill leaves.At the fissure, the concrete cap explodes and a mud like substance flows out. The atomic pile at the facility is now inactive. They are removing the cobalt to be transported elsewhere. McGill calls headquarters and requests a delay in his return to London. The phone line is bad and he has trouble hearing his boss. As he leaves he hears a police report about, ""People Melting.""

""It's on its way for the biggest meal of its life."" McGill arrives at the facility as the cobalt is loaded onto a truck. The creature arrives at one of the guard posts and an alarm is sounded.

Not wanting to do any of the work but retain the glory, Walter creates a new position - Executive Director - that person who effectively will become head of the organization. The heads of the three primary arms of the business - John Day Griffith (newspaper), Mark Loving (wire service) and Harry Kritzer (photographic service) - are those in line for the job, each who will do whatever he needs to for the appointment. Walter has decided that whoever of the three solves and reports the Lipstick Killings first will get the position. The Lipstick Killings are the murders of young women, the murderer who scrawls a note in lipstick at the murder scene after the fact. Pulitzer Prize winning author and reporter Edward Mobley is seen by most to be the real brains of the organization, although he has no desire for the top job. Although he initially will not get into the internal fight for the job, Ed, who has connections to the police department and has his own thoughts as to the psychological profile of the killer, decides to assist his old friend, John Griffith, in solving the case. In their quest, those involved do not hesitate to use the women in their lives - namely Nancy Liggett (Ed's fiancée and Mark's secretary), Dorothy Kyne (Walter's wife), and Women's Affairs columnist Mildred Donner - in whatever manner they can.

                    There is money missing from a bank job, an attractive model, an insurance investigator, and two extremely dangerous thugs. James Vanning (Aldo Ray) portrays an innocent man on the run, being pursued by the criminals who stupidly misplaced their take from the crime and think he has it or knows where it is hidden. Add model Marie Gardner (Anne Bancroft) who crossed paths with nice guy Vanning, while he is on the run. This all adds up to a thriller wherein the viewer is drawn into the story and becomes part of the drama. When Marie says ""things that really happen are difficult to explain"" it captures the theme of this film. A nice girl helps a nice guy, who is innocent and is drawn into the drama. As tension mounts she says: ""I am always meeting the wrong man, and it leads to doomed relationships."" Marie inadvertently leads Vanning into the hands of the villains. However, she is a pseudo-femme fatale, innocently involved in the intrigue and, like the viewer, is gradually drawn into the plot. Beside one of the more chilling murder scenes for that era, the film has a three part flashback, which takes the viewer from a cityscape and menacing oil wells to the snow-covered plains of Wyoming and back to the streets of Hollywood. The interplay of high contrast images makes it worth seeing, but the story keeps the viewer engaged.

                    Rancher Chuck Rodwell is at the Sands Resort Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on his annual gambling getaway. Everyone at the Sands knows and welcomes Chuck not only because he is good-natured, but because he is a perpetual loser in the games of chance in the casino. Concurrently at the resort is Maria Corvier, a US-born, Paris-bred ballerina, whose manager Pierre booked her on a lucrative $60,000, two-week stint at the resort's supper club purely as a springboard to a more prestigious gig hopefully in New York City. Maria is all work and no play, does not like this gig of having to perform in a noisy supper club, and does not like the general brash atmosphere of Las Vegas. When Chuck and Maria first meet, she has no time for him, she seeing him as the typical Las Vegas type. However, Chuck, based on circumstances, believes Maria is his lucky charm, he winning at those games of chance whenever he holds her hand. Maria, in turn, begins to believe the same, not only that she is his lucky charm, but that he also is hers. Despite their obvious differences, Chuck and Maria start to fall for each other based partly on the magic feeling of their winning streak. Their attraction and that magic turns to talk of marriage. Beyond the Las Vegas casino and hotel managers, including the Sands own Tom Culdane, and Pierre having their own views of what they want to happen between Chuck and Maria, the strongest force may be the third that has always been in their relationship, Lady Luck, and what would happen if she were ever to leave them.

"87","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049944/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The movie opens with a scene of a small village in the mountains at night. It is the downtown business district of the small town of Mountaincrest (Big Bear, California), lit by street lights and neon signs. A narrator (an uncredited Fred F. Sears) tells us, ""The word lycanthropy is defined as a human being having the power of becoming a wolf, or of having the power of turning another human into a wolf. Some say lycanthropy stems from nothing but myth and superstition. Yet the belief that a human can turn into a wolf has persisted since the Dark Ages to this very day. It is a universal belief. The ancient Romans and Greeks wrote of the phenomenon. There are tales of such happenings in Borneo, Turkey, South America. Everywhere. The American Navajo Indians and other tribes tell stories about wolf-men. The legends have persisted from the beginnings of man's memory of time. Why? Why haven't these tales died? The tales that say wolf-men roam the earth."" A man, Duncan Marsh (Steven Rich) approaches Chad's Place, the local bar and watering hole. He hesitates, then enters the establishment. Titles and credits roll.A woman, Min (Marjorie Stapp), a tall blonde feeds a few coins into a jukebox, then returns to her seat at the bar. Marsh pays for his drink, but Hoxie (George Cisar) the bartender is annoyed that it is a large denomination bill, a twenty. Marsh finishes his drink, ignores his change, and slowly walks over to the fireplace and stares at the roaring fire. Marsh slowly walks to the exit but is reminded by Hoxie he has left his change. A tough looking man, Joe Mitchell (an uncredited Charles Horvath) notices Marsh and his slight build and casual way with money and follows him outside. Joe confronts Marsh and demands his money. He pulls Marsh into an alley and beats him up. An old woman, Ma Everett (an uncredited Jean Harvey), passing by hears and sees the commotion and stops to watch. Growls are heard and the feet of the scuffling men are seen. Marsh is victorious in the exchange, but he has changed physically. While we don't see yet, the woman is horrified by the visage and screams. The patrons and bartender are drawn outside by the woman's screams. She explains what happened to Hoxie. Deputy Sheriff Ben Clovey (Harry Lauter) checks on Joe. Hoxie grimaces and says, ""His throat."" Clovey adds, ""Hoxie, only an animal could do that to a man's throat."" Clovey sends Hank Durgis (Larry J. Blake) to fetch Doctor Jonas Gilcrist.Marsh runs out into the woods, followed by the now well armed Ben Clovey, Hoxie, and Mack Fanning (James Gavin) who follow his footprints. Shoe prints suddenly turn into wolf paw prints. Hoxie gets cold feet and insists any further investigation is the responsibility of the law. Ben sends Hoxie and Mack back to brief the Sheriff, Jack Haines. The two men depart and Clovey remains. Back at the bar, Chad's Place, the patrons discuss events. Mack looks out the window and sees Sheriff Haines and Clovey walking back into town. They exit the bar and notice Clovey has been injured. Sheriff Jack Haines (Don Megowan) tells the patrons, ""I don't want you breathing a word about what happened tonight to anyone. Understand? Nobody."" Jack takes Ben to see Dr. Jonas Gilcrist. Amy Standish (Joyce Holden) answers the door. She is the doctor's niece, and leads the men into a room and starts to tend to Ben's arm wounds. She explains that the man killed earlier, Joe, was dead when they brought him. She gets her uncle. Jack asks Ben about what attacked him. Clovey tries to describe the creature, but admits it was dark and he didn't get a good look at the thing. Dr. Jonas Gilcrist (Ken Christy) enters wearing a bathrobe and complaining about the late hour. The doctor wants information and reminds the sheriff that if he wants to marry his niece he better be more forthcoming. Jonas treats Clovey and leaves the bandaging to Amy. Clovey intimates that it may be a werewolf, but Doc Gilcrist isn't buying, ""Storybook stuff. The things kids get nightmares about."" Sheriff Haines intends to set up roadblocks, ""Nothing's getting in or out of town without us knowing."" Haines kisses Amy goodnight, and he and his deputy leave.The next morning, Marsh wakes up shivering from the cold in a drainage opening. He is in distress and rubs his bare feet. He sees paw prints in the snow and recognizes something familiar, ""I was dreaming! I know I was dreaming!"" He tries to convince himself some animal wandered by and left the tracks. He finds his shoes and socks and puts them back on his feet. Outside the Sheriff's Office, a crowd of men gather to complain about the moratorium on hunting in the woods. The Sheriff checks on the roadblocks. Three reporters are curious about the roadblock and admit that a talkative undertaker in Larken gave them enough information to know a story was worth investigating in Mountaincrest. The Sheriff relents and allows them to come to town. Marsh observes the roadblock from a higher elevation then heads back into the woods. He happens upon Amy outside her home getting firewood from the pile. He tells Amy he came looking for the doctor and asks to see him. Amy leads him into the house. Marsh tells Amy and Jonas he doesn't remember his name, ""I can't remember who I am, or even what I'm doing in this town."" He recalls an automobile accident and seeing two doctors. He asks if a man was killed the night before. When told yes, he asks how and is told it was by an animal. Marsh corrects the doctor and admits he killed Joe. When Amy presents him with a sedative he reacts violently and runs from the house. Amy calls the Sheriff's Office and speaks to Clovey. Jonas and Amy go to the Sheriff's Office and wait for Jack to return. They relay their story to Ben and Jack. Amy tries to dissuade Jack from hunting him down like a criminal because, ""He's not a criminal. He's a sick man."" Jonas and Amy tell the Sheriff he was in an auto accident and he may have brain damage.A man in a lab coat is performing an experiment on a wolf. His name is Dr. Morgan Chambers (George Lynn) and his colleague, Dr. Emery Forrest (S. John Launer) enters the lab carrying a newspaper. Morgan asks, ""You think this is our man?"" Emery replies, ""The paper says they found an animal's teeth marks on the dead man's throat. Morgan, what have you done?"" Morgan, the prototype mad scientist rants about humans destroying themselves with technology. Morgan has a plan to inoculate himself and a few deserving people with his serum and revert to some lower form, but better adapted creature. Morgan knows the side effects of his serum, but is not concerned with Marsh. Morgan tells Emery they must go to Mountaincrest. He casually informs his colleague, ""If the police haven't disposed of the man by the time we get there, it may become our task."" The doorbell rings and Morgan answers. He is distressed to find Mrs. Helen Marsh (Eleanore Tanin). She is inquiring about her husband. Morgan explains that his injuries were slight and he left soon after treatment. She leaves the office and returns to her car. Her son, Chris (Kim Charney) asks about his father. They get in the car and drive home, hoping Marsh will call. Marsh has taken back to the woods, but he has been followed by a large and angry posse. Drs. Forrest and Chambers encounter the roadblock trying to enter Mountaincrest. They identify themselves and indicate they have information that will help the Sheriff. They are allowed to pass. It is getting late and the Sheriff and posse agree to push on for another half mile. Forrest and Chambers are armed and doing their own search. Marsh hears them approaching and hides in the entrance of an old mine. Forrest spotted him and enters the mine. He finds Marsh. Marsh asks for help, but is told nothing can be done. Marsh transforms into a werewolf. Forrest tries to escape, calling for his partner. Forrest is attacked by the werewolf, but a shot by Morgan's rifle scares him off. The Sheriff and his posse arrive, and Haines is very unhappy the interference flushed Marsh from the mine. Dr. Chambers tells the Sheriff that Marsh was a patient of theirs. That night Clovey tells the Sheriff and Amy that Marsh killed a sheep over at the Sanderson Ranch and ate it. Haines, Amy and Jonas meet to discuss the Sheriff's plan, which is to put out bait and use bear traps to catch Marsh.The next morning the Sheriff oversees the preparation of the traps. He returns to the office to talk to the three reporters. The three lawmen exchange information and now know the identity of the man--Duncan Marsh. Mrs. Marsh and son drive to Mountaincrest. Marsh is still in the woods and takes the bait and is caught by the trap. He is able to free himself but is now seriously injured, and transforms back to human form. Forrest and Chambers meet at the bar. Chambers is concerned that now that Marsh's wife is in town the law may try a capture rather than a kill strategy. Chambers wants Marsh dead. Mrs. Marsh and Chris are staying at the home of Jonas and Amy. Mrs. Marsh confronts the Sheriff and is told the facts. She volunteers to join the search and the Sheriff reluctantly agrees.Haines, Clovey, Amy, Mrs. Marsh and Chris begin the search. Helen Marsh tries to get her husband to surrender. Marsh shows himself and his son rushes up to greet him. Helen joins her husband. Amy renders first aid. The posse has gathered at the bar to get drunk and gloat. Duncan Marsh is now in a jail cell at the Sheriff's Office. He meets with his wife and son and implores his family to leave before he changes again. Amy escorts them from the cell. Chambers asks Forrest to find out what precautions the Sheriff is taking to guard Marsh. Jonas Gilcrist, Amy and the Sheriff speculate on Marsh's condition. He notes, ""The thing is, the man who did it to Marsh. What did he have in mind?"" Amy adds, ""And what kind of a future is he dreaming up for everybody else?"" Haines spends the night at the doctor's house.Chambers encounters a very drunk Hank Durgis and persuades him to help him get inside the Sheriff's Office. Forrest knocks Hank out and the two doctors drag their drunk accomplice down to the station. Forrest prepares a sedative of chloroform on a rag for the deputy. When Clovey checks on Hank, the two doctors grab him and administer their sedative. They drag the bodies of both Clovey and Hank back inside the office, then make their way to the cell holding Marsh. Chambers prepares a syringe. They approach the sleeping Marsh, but discover, to their horror and regret, that Marsh isn't sleeping or himself. The werewolf dispatches the two doctors, but not without a lot of screaming, which draws the attention of both the Sheriff and the townsfolk.With two more bodies, the Sheriff is convinced hunting down and killing Marsh is the only solution. He and the posse search the woods. Armed with torches and guns they press on, encouraged by a blood trail to follow. They close in and throw torches at the creature. The fire and gunshots scare the werewolf. The Sheriff and posse decide to leave and return when it's light. The next morning they return in force and begin the pursuit. They spot him heading for the bridge. A Caterpillar Grader is employed to block the bridge. The werewolf climbs over the bridge and up an embankment. He is shot several times and transforms back into human form as he lay dying. We close with a scene on the bridge and an exchange between Haines and Clovey. Clovey exclaims, ""You see that? He changed back again. Do you think he'll stay that way this time?"" Haines replies, ""Yeah, he'll stay. Now he can go home.""","
    
                    Two scientists come across an auto accident, and find an unconscious man in the wreck. They take him back to their lab and inject him with a serum they have been working with. Unfortunately, the serum has the effect of turning the man into a murderous werewolf.

    Synopsis
    The movie opens with a scene of a small village in the mountains at night. It is the downtown business district of the small town of Mountaincrest (Big Bear, California), lit by street lights and neon signs. A narrator (an uncredited Fred F. Sears) tells us, ""The word lycanthropy is defined as a human being having the power of becoming a wolf, or of having the power of turning another human into a wolf. Some say lycanthropy stems from nothing but myth and superstition. Yet the belief that a human can turn into a wolf has persisted since the Dark Ages to this very day. It is a universal belief. The ancient Romans and Greeks wrote of the phenomenon. There are tales of such happenings in Borneo, Turkey, South America. Everywhere. The American Navajo Indians and other tribes tell stories about wolf-men. The legends have persisted from the beginnings of man's memory of time. Why? Why haven't these tales died? The tales that say wolf-men roam the earth."" A man, Duncan Marsh (Steven Rich) approaches Chad's Place, the local bar and watering hole. He hesitates, then enters the establishment. Titles and credits roll.A woman, Min (Marjorie Stapp), a tall blonde feeds a few coins into a jukebox, then returns to her seat at the bar. Marsh pays for his drink, but Hoxie (George Cisar) the bartender is annoyed that it is a large denomination bill, a twenty. Marsh finishes his drink, ignores his change, and slowly walks over to the fireplace and stares at the roaring fire. Marsh slowly walks to the exit but is reminded by Hoxie he has left his change. A tough looking man, Joe Mitchell (an uncredited Charles Horvath) notices Marsh and his slight build and casual way with money and follows him outside. Joe confronts Marsh and demands his money. He pulls Marsh into an alley and beats him up. An old woman, Ma Everett (an uncredited Jean Harvey), passing by hears and sees the commotion and stops to watch. Growls are heard and the feet of the scuffling men are seen. Marsh is victorious in the exchange, but he has changed physically. While we don't see yet, the woman is horrified by the visage and screams. The patrons and bartender are drawn outside by the woman's screams. She explains what happened to Hoxie. Deputy Sheriff Ben Clovey (Harry Lauter) checks on Joe. Hoxie grimaces and says, ""His throat."" Clovey adds, ""Hoxie, only an animal could do that to a man's throat."" Clovey sends Hank Durgis (Larry J. Blake) to fetch Doctor Jonas Gilcrist.Marsh runs out into the woods, followed by the now well armed Ben Clovey, Hoxie, and Mack Fanning (James Gavin) who follow his footprints. Shoe prints suddenly turn into wolf paw prints. Hoxie gets cold feet and insists any further investigation is the responsibility of the law. Ben sends Hoxie and Mack back to brief the Sheriff, Jack Haines. The two men depart and Clovey remains. Back at the bar, Chad's Place, the patrons discuss events. Mack looks out the window and sees Sheriff Haines and Clovey walking back into town. They exit the bar and notice Clovey has been injured. Sheriff Jack Haines (Don Megowan) tells the patrons, ""I don't want you breathing a word about what happened tonight to anyone. Understand? Nobody."" Jack takes Ben to see Dr. Jonas Gilcrist. Amy Standish (Joyce Holden) answers the door. She is the doctor's niece, and leads the men into a room and starts to tend to Ben's arm wounds. She explains that the man killed earlier, Joe, was dead when they brought him. She gets her uncle. Jack asks Ben about what attacked him. Clovey tries to describe the creature, but admits it was dark and he didn't get a good look at the thing. Dr. Jonas Gilcrist (Ken Christy) enters wearing a bathrobe and complaining about the late hour. The doctor wants information and reminds the sheriff that if he wants to marry his niece he better be more forthcoming. Jonas treats Clovey and leaves the bandaging to Amy. Clovey intimates that it may be a werewolf, but Doc Gilcrist isn't buying, ""Storybook stuff. The things kids get nightmares about."" Sheriff Haines intends to set up roadblocks, ""Nothing's getting in or out of town without us knowing."" Haines kisses Amy goodnight, and he and his deputy leave.The next morning, Marsh wakes up shivering from the cold in a drainage opening. He is in distress and rubs his bare feet. He sees paw prints in the snow and recognizes something familiar, ""I was dreaming! I know I was dreaming!"" He tries to convince himself some animal wandered by and left the tracks. He finds his shoes and socks and puts them back on his feet. Outside the Sheriff's Office, a crowd of men gather to complain about the moratorium on hunting in the woods. The Sheriff checks on the roadblocks. Three reporters are curious about the roadblock and admit that a talkative undertaker in Larken gave them enough information to know a story was worth investigating in Mountaincrest. The Sheriff relents and allows them to come to town. Marsh observes the roadblock from a higher elevation then heads back into the woods. He happens upon Amy outside her home getting firewood from the pile. He tells Amy he came looking for the doctor and asks to see him. Amy leads him into the house. Marsh tells Amy and Jonas he doesn't remember his name, ""I can't remember who I am, or even what I'm doing in this town."" He recalls an automobile accident and seeing two doctors. He asks if a man was killed the night before. When told yes, he asks how and is told it was by an animal. Marsh corrects the doctor and admits he killed Joe. When Amy presents him with a sedative he reacts violently and runs from the house. Amy calls the Sheriff's Office and speaks to Clovey. Jonas and Amy go to the Sheriff's Office and wait for Jack to return. They relay their story to Ben and Jack. Amy tries to dissuade Jack from hunting him down like a criminal because, ""He's not a criminal. He's a sick man."" Jonas and Amy tell the Sheriff he was in an auto accident and he may have brain damage.A man in a lab coat is performing an experiment on a wolf. His name is Dr. Morgan Chambers (George Lynn) and his colleague, Dr. Emery Forrest (S. John Launer) enters the lab carrying a newspaper. Morgan asks, ""You think this is our man?"" Emery replies, ""The paper says they found an animal's teeth marks on the dead man's throat. Morgan, what have you done?"" Morgan, the prototype mad scientist rants about humans destroying themselves with technology. Morgan has a plan to inoculate himself and a few deserving people with his serum and revert to some lower form, but better adapted creature. Morgan knows the side effects of his serum, but is not concerned with Marsh. Morgan tells Emery they must go to Mountaincrest. He casually informs his colleague, ""If the police haven't disposed of the man by the time we get there, it may become our task."" The doorbell rings and Morgan answers. He is distressed to find Mrs. Helen Marsh (Eleanore Tanin). She is inquiring about her husband. Morgan explains that his injuries were slight and he left soon after treatment. She leaves the office and returns to her car. Her son, Chris (Kim Charney) asks about his father. They get in the car and drive home, hoping Marsh will call. Marsh has taken back to the woods, but he has been followed by a large and angry posse. Drs. Forrest and Chambers encounter the roadblock trying to enter Mountaincrest. They identify themselves and indicate they have information that will help the Sheriff. They are allowed to pass. It is getting late and the Sheriff and posse agree to push on for another half mile. Forrest and Chambers are armed and doing their own search. Marsh hears them approaching and hides in the entrance of an old mine. Forrest spotted him and enters the mine. He finds Marsh. Marsh asks for help, but is told nothing can be done. Marsh transforms into a werewolf. Forrest tries to escape, calling for his partner. Forrest is attacked by the werewolf, but a shot by Morgan's rifle scares him off. The Sheriff and his posse arrive, and Haines is very unhappy the interference flushed Marsh from the mine. Dr. Chambers tells the Sheriff that Marsh was a patient of theirs. That night Clovey tells the Sheriff and Amy that Marsh killed a sheep over at the Sanderson Ranch and ate it. Haines, Amy and Jonas meet to discuss the Sheriff's plan, which is to put out bait and use bear traps to catch Marsh.The next morning the Sheriff oversees the preparation of the traps. He returns to the office to talk to the three reporters. The three lawmen exchange information and now know the identity of the man--Duncan Marsh. Mrs. Marsh and son drive to Mountaincrest. Marsh is still in the woods and takes the bait and is caught by the trap. He is able to free himself but is now seriously injured, and transforms back to human form. Forrest and Chambers meet at the bar. Chambers is concerned that now that Marsh's wife is in town the law may try a capture rather than a kill strategy. Chambers wants Marsh dead. Mrs. Marsh and Chris are staying at the home of Jonas and Amy. Mrs. Marsh confronts the Sheriff and is told the facts. She volunteers to join the search and the Sheriff reluctantly agrees.Haines, Clovey, Amy, Mrs. Marsh and Chris begin the search. Helen Marsh tries to get her husband to surrender. Marsh shows himself and his son rushes up to greet him. Helen joins her husband. Amy renders first aid. The posse has gathered at the bar to get drunk and gloat. Duncan Marsh is now in a jail cell at the Sheriff's Office. He meets with his wife and son and implores his family to leave before he changes again. Amy escorts them from the cell. Chambers asks Forrest to find out what precautions the Sheriff is taking to guard Marsh. Jonas Gilcrist, Amy and the Sheriff speculate on Marsh's condition. He notes, ""The thing is, the man who did it to Marsh. What did he have in mind?"" Amy adds, ""And what kind of a future is he dreaming up for everybody else?"" Haines spends the night at the doctor's house.Chambers encounters a very drunk Hank Durgis and persuades him to help him get inside the Sheriff's Office. Forrest knocks Hank out and the two doctors drag their drunk accomplice down to the station. Forrest prepares a sedative of chloroform on a rag for the deputy. When Clovey checks on Hank, the two doctors grab him and administer their sedative. They drag the bodies of both Clovey and Hank back inside the office, then make their way to the cell holding Marsh. Chambers prepares a syringe. They approach the sleeping Marsh, but discover, to their horror and regret, that Marsh isn't sleeping or himself. The werewolf dispatches the two doctors, but not without a lot of screaming, which draws the attention of both the Sheriff and the townsfolk.With two more bodies, the Sheriff is convinced hunting down and killing Marsh is the only solution. He and the posse search the woods. Armed with torches and guns they press on, encouraged by a blood trail to follow. They close in and throw torches at the creature. The fire and gunshots scare the werewolf. The Sheriff and posse decide to leave and return when it's light. The next morning they return in force and begin the pursuit. They spot him heading for the bridge. A Caterpillar Grader is employed to block the bridge. The werewolf climbs over the bridge and up an embankment. He is shot several times and transforms back into human form as he lay dying. We close with a scene on the bridge and an exchange between Haines and Clovey. Clovey exclaims, ""You see that? He changed back again. Do you think he'll stay that way this time?"" Haines replies, ""Yeah, he'll stay. Now he can go home.""

                    The year is 1947, the British are on the verge of finally leaving India. Amongst the few who are sorry to see the British leave are the Anglo-Indians, half British and half Indian, for they are going to miss the patronage of their white cousins, the job reservations, and the important status and positions they currently hold. The British, quite frankly, do not think well of Anglo-Indians, nor do the Indians. Victoria Jones is one such Anglo-Indian, a WAC in the British Army, her father a railway engine driver, and her mom a housewife. She is close to another Anglo-Indian, Patrick Taylor, but changes her mind about him as he harbors deep hatred for the Indians. She witnesses Col. Rodney Savage instruct his soldiers to pour filthy water and garbage at the hands of untouchables on high-caste men and women who are protesting by laying down on the railway tracks to prevent trains from moving. Repulsed and shocked at this, she turns to Ranjit Singh Kassi, a Sikh, and longs to be Indian. She even accompanies him to the Gurudwara in order to change her faith. Then circumstances make her change her mind in favor of Rodney Savage. What Rodney does not know is that Victoria harbors a deep dark secret - a murder of a white British Officer named Graham McDaniels, on one hand, and of her knowledge of a terrorist named Ghanshyam - the one who was responsible for stealing explosives from a stranded train - and who may use these to bring the railways to a halt by planting them on the tracks, his motive to disrupt the railways, and to kill the passengers of a train. And amongst the passengers is none other than Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi - more popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi.

                    In the time leading up to Indian independence, civil disturbances are becoming the norm. Colonel Rodney Savage arrives in Bhowani Junction with his troops, intent on keeping the peace. While most Indians support Ghandi's non-violent approach, communist agitators led by someone known only as Davay are prepared to use violence to meet their objectives. The beautiful Victoria Jones - an Anglo-Indian of mixed English and Indian heritage - returns home for a holiday. The Anglo-Indian community run the railroads and are not accepted by either the English or the Indians and Victoria herself is torn between both cultures. As a subaltern in the WAC (I) however, she soon finds herself back on duty as protests increase. After a violent encounter with a lecherous British officer, she is blackmailed into helping the communists with their plot. She and Savage however have also fallen in love.

                    At breakfast, Jane announces that she and Ralph are getting married the next week. All Jane and Ralph want is a small wedding with the immediate family and no reception, because Jane's parents are poor and Jane and Ralph can borrow a car for their honeymoon. But at dinner that night, all Ralph's parents talk about are the big weddings they gave their daughters, and everything escalates. Suddenly it's a big wedding breakfast with hundreds of guests. The problem is that for 12 years, Tom has been saving money to buy his own cab and license, but now that he can, all of that money is going towards a wedding that neither he nor Jane nor Ralph really want.

                    Jane Hurley, the daughter of Bronx cabbie Tom Hurley and housewife Aggie Hurley, has just announced to her family that she is getting married to her boyfriend of three years, Ralph Halloran, a teacher from a middle-class background whose father Joe is a successful real-estate agent. The Hurleys and Hallorans have never met and Jane doesn't want her parents to make any extra fuss to appear better off than they are just to compete. Tom, the family spendthrift, agrees. Jane and Ralph decide to be married in four days in a small church ceremony with just the immediate family and no reception, then immediately leave on a driving honeymoon to California. Aggie and Tom had long discussed giving Jane an unspecified amount of money as a wedding gift, which Jane doesn't really want as she and Ralph are eking out a decent living for themselves and she knows money has always been very tight in her parents' household.

"100","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049515/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","A wagon train courses across the Cherry Valley in New York, headed for Ft. Alden. As members of various indian tribes comprising the Iroquois Nation watch, two women riding on a wagon are worried about possible danger. The man driving the wagon tells them that the indians are currently peaceful, but can't be trusted to stay that way. He tells them white women in their war paint (make-up) make him much more nervous.The women are Aunt Agatha (Barbara Jo Allen) and her niece Cynthia (Lori Nelson) Stanhope. They are on their way from Boston to Ft. Alden to find Jonathan Adams (Scott Brady), an artist whom Cynthia hopes to marry. Adams had been commissioned by the Massachusetts Society to go to Ft. Alden and produce at least 20 paintings representing the area.Captain Langley (John Hudson) is the commandant of Ft. Alden. When he learns that the ladies are there to meet up with Jonathan Adams, he's a bit taken aback, especially when they tell him that Cynthia is Jonathan's fiance. It seems Jonathan has a bit of a reputation as a ladies man. The ladies' visit was meant to be a surprise.Langley calls over the fort's store proprietor, Clem Jones (Rhys Williams), and asks him if he knows where Adams is. Jones doesn't know specifically, only that Adams is with his daughter Greta (Allison Hayes), and a milk cow, outside the fort someplace doing a painting.Greta is a beautiful redhead who is in love with Adams, but she knows he doesn't love her, so when he mentions that he should marry a woman like her, she comments that she's too stupid for him and will be fat like her father in another 10 years.Three Iroquois maidens stumble upon Greta and Jonathan, but the couple don't see them. One of the maidens is Onida (Rita Gam), the daughter of Chief Kowanen (Ted de Corsia). She's curious about the practice of kissing, which she observes Greta and Jonathan do.Mr. Butler (John Hoyt) is a life-long resident of the Cherry Valley who resents both the indians and the settlers who now live there. He goes over to the indian encampment and meets with Chief Kowanen, informing the chief that 61 new settlers and a wagon load of rifles had recently arrived in the valley, inferring that the rifles were meant to be used against the indians to force them off their lands, which are needed for the growing number of settlers. Kowanen responds that ""the eagle is not afraid of the mole."" That elicits and immediate response from a Tuscarora Indian named Rokhawah (Neville Brand), who says that's just the sort of thing that his father used to say before their people were overwhelmed by the white man.Minikah (Mae Clarke), Kowanen's wife, glances down at the indian blanket draped across her shoulders and reads the story told by the symbols on the blanket about the history of their people and how the Great Spirit and the wise men all counseled the Iroquois peoples to band together and maintain the peace by being strong in unity. Kowanen tells Butler and Rokhawah that he will not seek hostilities against the whites.Jonathan and Greta arrive back at the fort just as the gates are being closed at sunset. Jonathan is shocked to see Cynthia and Aunt Agatha standing there. After exchanging hugs hello, he introduces them to Greta. Cynthia then asks Jonathan to show her what paintings he had completed to date. She observes that he is two months overdue in returning to Boston. She wants him to return with her and get married. He doesn't seem interested in either idea.Greta shows Agatha the painting she and the cow had been modeling for. In the painting, Greta stands holding the bottom of her skirt up so that her legs are showing. Agatha doesn't seem impressed.At dinner, Butler is informed by Agatha that she is a ""Miss,"" and further explains that she's a spinster due to her wit, because every time a man proposed to her, she laughed at him, and after some time, the joke was on her. Mr. Butler reveals a strong bitterness to his table mates when he speaks that his family used to be the only white family in the valley and they considered it to be their personal property. He thinks that indians have the same rights as animals and are fit to be no more than slaves. He observes that so many white settlers are showing up, that they are squeezing the life out of the valley.Kowanen's and Minikah's son, Keoga (Tommy Cook), and Rokhawah both believe an attempt should be made to get the rifles away from the settlers so they can't be used against them. Keoga asks his sister, Onida, if she will help them. Onida seems to share their concerns and agrees to help. Because indians are allowed inside the fort during the day, but must leave at dusk, Onida hides out inside the fort and later lets the warriors in through a door connected to a secret tunnel that leads outside the fort. The indians proceed to club four sentries unconscious and begin removing rifles from the back of a wagon and passing them to others outside the fort. Another sentry sees them and shoots, wounding one brave. The rest of the fort's occupants are alerted by the shooting and rush out to see what's up. The indians all make to escape, but another warrior is shot before they all get out. Agatha wonders why Jonathan just sits at a table continuing to calmly eat his supper when there's obvious trouble outside. He tells her that his help isn't needed. Seeing that the ladies are distraught, he offers to escort them to their quarters for the night, then goes to his own room. Onida didn't go over the wall with the warriors, so she attempts to return to the tunnel to get out, but as Adams is there by then, he grabs her as she runs past. He's immediately taken with her looks and spirit. They struggle for awhile, but when they hear others approaching, he hides her behind his bed. A small detail led by the commandant enter Adams' quarters. An old timer immediately goes to the doorway in the wall and explains to the commandant that it provides access to a tunnel leading outside the fort and was likely how the warriors gained entry. A small keg of dynamite is placed inside the tunnel and it's blown closed. After the detail leaves his room, Adams tells Onida that he'll smuggle her outside the fort tomorrow in his wagon. He tells her he would like to paint a picture of her. He directs her to a mat on the floor to sleep on. When he gets in his big bed and turns on his side to gaze admirably at her, she pulls her knife from it's sheath in a threatening gesture and he turns over and goes to sleep.The next morning, Cynthia asks Greta why she's in the picture Adams is painting when there's already a cow. Greta explains that the cow is required by the Massachusetts Society and she's in there as the surprise.Adams tells Cynthia and Greta that he's going out to paint by himself that day. With Onida in the back of his wagon covered with a blanket, he hooks up the milk cow and heads out. He tells the soldiers at the gate that he won't hold them accountable should anything happen to him as a result of the indians being riled up. They decide to go ahead and let him leave the fort.Out in the countryside, Onida climbs up on the seat next to Adams. She wants to know the nature of his relationship with Cynthia and Greta, as she'd witnessed him kissing them both. She says her people never kiss and she doesn't understand it. He then kisses her and she pulls away and laughs. It tickled and seems odd to her. Onida tells Adams that he's different than other white men and she thinks he has a good heart. She wants him to come to her village and learn about her people and learn how peaceful they are. Adams says he'll go if he can paint what he sees.At the indian camp, a council is underway. The leaders are discussing recent events. Rokhawah is the most agitated and is itching for a fight. When Adams arrives, Rokhawah insults him, prompting Onida to chastise Rokhawah, as does her brother, Keoga. When Rokhawah slaps Onida, Adams punches him and the fight is on. Rokhawah draws a knife, but Adams evades it and knocks Rokhawah down and takes away the knife, breaking it on a tree trunk.Chief Kowanen takes a liking to Adams and tells him he's always welcome among his people. Adams offers to paint the indians so he can show other whites the pictures and allow them to get to know the Iroquois better.When Jonathan does not return to the fort by sundown, nor for the next several days, the women are very upset, especially when the commandant won't send a patrol out to look for him. Agatha astutely figures Adams is either dead or in the arms of some beautiful woman. The commandant tells them that Jonathan had been warned of the danger. Mr. Butler wants to go to the encampment and forcibly search for Adams if need be (an excuse to slaughter them), but Langley says no. Butler tells the people at the fort that they'd better react to the earlier attack at the fort and to Adams' disappearance, or the indians will believe there's no repercussions to fear. Jonathan is busy painting scenes of indian life at the encampment. He paints a scene of indians signing a traditional song around a campfire as Onida explains it's meaning to him, then the next morning, working shirtless, he paints a group of women washing clothes on the rocks in a nearby stream as another group of young women play what seems to be an early game of Frisbee. Onida is one of the Frisbee players and when Adams teases her by catching the ring and tossing it into the river, the other women join her in pushing him into the water. Adams and Onida end up wrestling around in the water and then kissing on the bank. Rokhawah, returning from a deer hunt, witnesses that and is obviously not pleased.Rather than send out a patrol to look for Adams, Langley decides to go by himself. He rides over to the indian encampment where he finds Adams painting a picture of the chief and his wife (they are very impressed with the work). Langley tells Chief Kowanen that Mr. Butler is stirring things up at the fort among the soldiers and settlers and they need to be reassured that the Indians have no intent of disturbing the peace. Jonathan offers to go back and explain what's going on. The chief decides that sending his son Keoga along will serve as a demonstration of his peoples' peaceful intent.As Adams and Keoga ride toward the fort, Butler is lying in wait and ambushes them. He shoots and kills Keoga, then runs off. Adams immediately places Keoga back in his wagon and returns with the body to the indian encampment.Rokhawah is about to bust with hatred and the desire for revenge now. As the Mohawk Priest (Michael Granger) says a prayer over Keoga's body, Rockaway interrupts and observes how the Iroquois people have not only suffered being killed by the whites but the dead must walk the earth forever because the whites had plowed up all the burial grounds. He calls for war. Chief Kowanen is likewise very upset but he won't go to war unless it's agreed to by the other chiefs. He calls for runners to go out and summon the chiefs to a war council.As Adams struggles to figure out who might have cause to shoot Keoga, Onida tells Adams about the time Butler came to the encampment and told her father about the arrival of new white settlers and a wagon with rifles. She now fears for the safety of Adams, telling him that if the Iroquois decide to go to war, he will likely be the first one killed and dumped outside the doors of the fort. She wants him to leave, but he refuses and instead runs over to where the war council is going on and tries to dissuade the chiefs from declaring war. They tie him to a tree at the edge of the encampment. The decision has been made to go to war. It's clear that Chief Kowanen has had a distinct change in attitude about his feelings towards Adams, now just another white man.Onida informs her mother that she loves Adams and will defend him to the death. Minikah seems angry about that at first, then showing great wisdom, she counsels her daughter to go cut Adams loose before he is killed. But, before Onida can do that, Rokhawah approaches Adams and prepares to start a process of slowly cutting and torturing Adams, preparatory to killing him. Onida then sneaks up on Rokhawah from behind and stabs him before he can do any harm to Adams. Onida then sends Adams away, to go warn the people at the fort. He promises to return for her.Some of the warriors see Jonathan jumping over the encampment wall and three of them give chase. It's a long way to the fort and they all run full tilt the entire way, but Adams is able to get their without being caught.The indians begin their attack and the settlers take flight, loading up their wagons with their women and children and head for Ft. Alden. The indians burn the abandoned homes and crops, whooping and hollering the entire time.Langley sends a rider to go find their colonel and bring back more men to help.Mr. Butler prepares to leave the fort on his own and ride away somewhere to safety. That's when Adams confronts him, suspecting he was the one who shot and killed Keoga and had also earlier told the Iroquois about the rifles in the wagon. Butler doesn't deny any of the accusations, making it apparent that he did do those things, so he's shoved outside the fort on foot, and the gates are barred behind him. As the indians approach the fort, Butler bangs on the doors begging to be let back in, but an arrow hits him in the back and kills him.The Iroquois rush the fort with homemade ladders, but they are repelled from scaling the walls. However, they massed outside the walls, so the fort gates are ordered open and a cannon is fired point blank into the mass of indians, causing them to lose their fervor and fall back to the edge of the woods.Cynthia doesn't want Adams to do any fighting, fearing it will kill or injure him so that he can't paint anymore. Greta tells Cynthia that Adams wouldn't amount to much of an artist if he wasn't a man first.The rider sent out by Langley reaches the colonel and the colonel orders his men to head for Ft. Alden. Meanwhile, the Iroquois have re-gathered for another attack. They find some powder kegs and place them near the gates of the fort and set them off. That causes a fire that results in Langley ordering everyone to fall back and get inside the buildings. The indians then climb over the stockade walls and open the gates. It's not long before they break into the buildings and the fighting becomes hand-to-hand. That's when the colonel and other men arrive and turn the tide. Lots of people are hurt or killed, but the battle has ended.Chief Kowanen is speaking about how the fight was such a waste and he believes that neither side won. Adams comes forward carrying the dead body of Butler and dumps it at the chief's feet, explaining that it was the man who killed Keoga. The chief announces that too many people had died already because of that man and peace is re-established.Adams sends more than his contracted 20 paintings back to Boston with Cynthia and Agatha. Both Cynthia and Greta had come to the understanding that Adams wasn't interested in marrying either one of them and that he was choosing to stay there.Adams heads back to the Iroquois encampment where he marries Onida. Chief Kowanen and his wife Minikah inform Adams that he is now like a son to them and they have given him an Iroquois name: Keoga. The End","

    Synopsis
    A wagon train courses across the Cherry Valley in New York, headed for Ft. Alden. As members of various indian tribes comprising the Iroquois Nation watch, two women riding on a wagon are worried about possible danger. The man driving the wagon tells them that the indians are currently peaceful, but can't be trusted to stay that way. He tells them white women in their war paint (make-up) make him much more nervous.The women are Aunt Agatha (Barbara Jo Allen) and her niece Cynthia (Lori Nelson) Stanhope. They are on their way from Boston to Ft. Alden to find Jonathan Adams (Scott Brady), an artist whom Cynthia hopes to marry. Adams had been commissioned by the Massachusetts Society to go to Ft. Alden and produce at least 20 paintings representing the area.Captain Langley (John Hudson) is the commandant of Ft. Alden. When he learns that the ladies are there to meet up with Jonathan Adams, he's a bit taken aback, especially when they tell him that Cynthia is Jonathan's fiance. It seems Jonathan has a bit of a reputation as a ladies man. The ladies' visit was meant to be a surprise.Langley calls over the fort's store proprietor, Clem Jones (Rhys Williams), and asks him if he knows where Adams is. Jones doesn't know specifically, only that Adams is with his daughter Greta (Allison Hayes), and a milk cow, outside the fort someplace doing a painting.Greta is a beautiful redhead who is in love with Adams, but she knows he doesn't love her, so when he mentions that he should marry a woman like her, she comments that she's too stupid for him and will be fat like her father in another 10 years.Three Iroquois maidens stumble upon Greta and Jonathan, but the couple don't see them. One of the maidens is Onida (Rita Gam), the daughter of Chief Kowanen (Ted de Corsia). She's curious about the practice of kissing, which she observes Greta and Jonathan do.Mr. Butler (John Hoyt) is a life-long resident of the Cherry Valley who resents both the indians and the settlers who now live there. He goes over to the indian encampment and meets with Chief Kowanen, informing the chief that 61 new settlers and a wagon load of rifles had recently arrived in the valley, inferring that the rifles were meant to be used against the indians to force them off their lands, which are needed for the growing number of settlers. Kowanen responds that ""the eagle is not afraid of the mole."" That elicits and immediate response from a Tuscarora Indian named Rokhawah (Neville Brand), who says that's just the sort of thing that his father used to say before their people were overwhelmed by the white man.Minikah (Mae Clarke), Kowanen's wife, glances down at the indian blanket draped across her shoulders and reads the story told by the symbols on the blanket about the history of their people and how the Great Spirit and the wise men all counseled the Iroquois peoples to band together and maintain the peace by being strong in unity. Kowanen tells Butler and Rokhawah that he will not seek hostilities against the whites.Jonathan and Greta arrive back at the fort just as the gates are being closed at sunset. Jonathan is shocked to see Cynthia and Aunt Agatha standing there. After exchanging hugs hello, he introduces them to Greta. Cynthia then asks Jonathan to show her what paintings he had completed to date. She observes that he is two months overdue in returning to Boston. She wants him to return with her and get married. He doesn't seem interested in either idea.Greta shows Agatha the painting she and the cow had been modeling for. In the painting, Greta stands holding the bottom of her skirt up so that her legs are showing. Agatha doesn't seem impressed.At dinner, Butler is informed by Agatha that she is a ""Miss,"" and further explains that she's a spinster due to her wit, because every time a man proposed to her, she laughed at him, and after some time, the joke was on her. Mr. Butler reveals a strong bitterness to his table mates when he speaks that his family used to be the only white family in the valley and they considered it to be their personal property. He thinks that indians have the same rights as animals and are fit to be no more than slaves. He observes that so many white settlers are showing up, that they are squeezing the life out of the valley.Kowanen's and Minikah's son, Keoga (Tommy Cook), and Rokhawah both believe an attempt should be made to get the rifles away from the settlers so they can't be used against them. Keoga asks his sister, Onida, if she will help them. Onida seems to share their concerns and agrees to help. Because indians are allowed inside the fort during the day, but must leave at dusk, Onida hides out inside the fort and later lets the warriors in through a door connected to a secret tunnel that leads outside the fort. The indians proceed to club four sentries unconscious and begin removing rifles from the back of a wagon and passing them to others outside the fort. Another sentry sees them and shoots, wounding one brave. The rest of the fort's occupants are alerted by the shooting and rush out to see what's up. The indians all make to escape, but another warrior is shot before they all get out. Agatha wonders why Jonathan just sits at a table continuing to calmly eat his supper when there's obvious trouble outside. He tells her that his help isn't needed. Seeing that the ladies are distraught, he offers to escort them to their quarters for the night, then goes to his own room. Onida didn't go over the wall with the warriors, so she attempts to return to the tunnel to get out, but as Adams is there by then, he grabs her as she runs past. He's immediately taken with her looks and spirit. They struggle for awhile, but when they hear others approaching, he hides her behind his bed. A small detail led by the commandant enter Adams' quarters. An old timer immediately goes to the doorway in the wall and explains to the commandant that it provides access to a tunnel leading outside the fort and was likely how the warriors gained entry. A small keg of dynamite is placed inside the tunnel and it's blown closed. After the detail leaves his room, Adams tells Onida that he'll smuggle her outside the fort tomorrow in his wagon. He tells her he would like to paint a picture of her. He directs her to a mat on the floor to sleep on. When he gets in his big bed and turns on his side to gaze admirably at her, she pulls her knife from it's sheath in a threatening gesture and he turns over and goes to sleep.The next morning, Cynthia asks Greta why she's in the picture Adams is painting when there's already a cow. Greta explains that the cow is required by the Massachusetts Society and she's in there as the surprise.Adams tells Cynthia and Greta that he's going out to paint by himself that day. With Onida in the back of his wagon covered with a blanket, he hooks up the milk cow and heads out. He tells the soldiers at the gate that he won't hold them accountable should anything happen to him as a result of the indians being riled up. They decide to go ahead and let him leave the fort.Out in the countryside, Onida climbs up on the seat next to Adams. She wants to know the nature of his relationship with Cynthia and Greta, as she'd witnessed him kissing them both. She says her people never kiss and she doesn't understand it. He then kisses her and she pulls away and laughs. It tickled and seems odd to her. Onida tells Adams that he's different than other white men and she thinks he has a good heart. She wants him to come to her village and learn about her people and learn how peaceful they are. Adams says he'll go if he can paint what he sees.At the indian camp, a council is underway. The leaders are discussing recent events. Rokhawah is the most agitated and is itching for a fight. When Adams arrives, Rokhawah insults him, prompting Onida to chastise Rokhawah, as does her brother, Keoga. When Rokhawah slaps Onida, Adams punches him and the fight is on. Rokhawah draws a knife, but Adams evades it and knocks Rokhawah down and takes away the knife, breaking it on a tree trunk.Chief Kowanen takes a liking to Adams and tells him he's always welcome among his people. Adams offers to paint the indians so he can show other whites the pictures and allow them to get to know the Iroquois better.When Jonathan does not return to the fort by sundown, nor for the next several days, the women are very upset, especially when the commandant won't send a patrol out to look for him. Agatha astutely figures Adams is either dead or in the arms of some beautiful woman. The commandant tells them that Jonathan had been warned of the danger. Mr. Butler wants to go to the encampment and forcibly search for Adams if need be (an excuse to slaughter them), but Langley says no. Butler tells the people at the fort that they'd better react to the earlier attack at the fort and to Adams' disappearance, or the indians will believe there's no repercussions to fear. Jonathan is busy painting scenes of indian life at the encampment. He paints a scene of indians signing a traditional song around a campfire as Onida explains it's meaning to him, then the next morning, working shirtless, he paints a group of women washing clothes on the rocks in a nearby stream as another group of young women play what seems to be an early game of Frisbee. Onida is one of the Frisbee players and when Adams teases her by catching the ring and tossing it into the river, the other women join her in pushing him into the water. Adams and Onida end up wrestling around in the water and then kissing on the bank. Rokhawah, returning from a deer hunt, witnesses that and is obviously not pleased.Rather than send out a patrol to look for Adams, Langley decides to go by himself. He rides over to the indian encampment where he finds Adams painting a picture of the chief and his wife (they are very impressed with the work). Langley tells Chief Kowanen that Mr. Butler is stirring things up at the fort among the soldiers and settlers and they need to be reassured that the Indians have no intent of disturbing the peace. Jonathan offers to go back and explain what's going on. The chief decides that sending his son Keoga along will serve as a demonstration of his peoples' peaceful intent.As Adams and Keoga ride toward the fort, Butler is lying in wait and ambushes them. He shoots and kills Keoga, then runs off. Adams immediately places Keoga back in his wagon and returns with the body to the indian encampment.Rokhawah is about to bust with hatred and the desire for revenge now. As the Mohawk Priest (Michael Granger) says a prayer over Keoga's body, Rockaway interrupts and observes how the Iroquois people have not only suffered being killed by the whites but the dead must walk the earth forever because the whites had plowed up all the burial grounds. He calls for war. Chief Kowanen is likewise very upset but he won't go to war unless it's agreed to by the other chiefs. He calls for runners to go out and summon the chiefs to a war council.As Adams struggles to figure out who might have cause to shoot Keoga, Onida tells Adams about the time Butler came to the encampment and told her father about the arrival of new white settlers and a wagon with rifles. She now fears for the safety of Adams, telling him that if the Iroquois decide to go to war, he will likely be the first one killed and dumped outside the doors of the fort. She wants him to leave, but he refuses and instead runs over to where the war council is going on and tries to dissuade the chiefs from declaring war. They tie him to a tree at the edge of the encampment. The decision has been made to go to war. It's clear that Chief Kowanen has had a distinct change in attitude about his feelings towards Adams, now just another white man.Onida informs her mother that she loves Adams and will defend him to the death. Minikah seems angry about that at first, then showing great wisdom, she counsels her daughter to go cut Adams loose before he is killed. But, before Onida can do that, Rokhawah approaches Adams and prepares to start a process of slowly cutting and torturing Adams, preparatory to killing him. Onida then sneaks up on Rokhawah from behind and stabs him before he can do any harm to Adams. Onida then sends Adams away, to go warn the people at the fort. He promises to return for her.Some of the warriors see Jonathan jumping over the encampment wall and three of them give chase. It's a long way to the fort and they all run full tilt the entire way, but Adams is able to get their without being caught.The indians begin their attack and the settlers take flight, loading up their wagons with their women and children and head for Ft. Alden. The indians burn the abandoned homes and crops, whooping and hollering the entire time.Langley sends a rider to go find their colonel and bring back more men to help.Mr. Butler prepares to leave the fort on his own and ride away somewhere to safety. That's when Adams confronts him, suspecting he was the one who shot and killed Keoga and had also earlier told the Iroquois about the rifles in the wagon. Butler doesn't deny any of the accusations, making it apparent that he did do those things, so he's shoved outside the fort on foot, and the gates are barred behind him. As the indians approach the fort, Butler bangs on the doors begging to be let back in, but an arrow hits him in the back and kills him.The Iroquois rush the fort with homemade ladders, but they are repelled from scaling the walls. However, they massed outside the walls, so the fort gates are ordered open and a cannon is fired point blank into the mass of indians, causing them to lose their fervor and fall back to the edge of the woods.Cynthia doesn't want Adams to do any fighting, fearing it will kill or injure him so that he can't paint anymore. Greta tells Cynthia that Adams wouldn't amount to much of an artist if he wasn't a man first.The rider sent out by Langley reaches the colonel and the colonel orders his men to head for Ft. Alden. Meanwhile, the Iroquois have re-gathered for another attack. They find some powder kegs and place them near the gates of the fort and set them off. That causes a fire that results in Langley ordering everyone to fall back and get inside the buildings. The indians then climb over the stockade walls and open the gates. It's not long before they break into the buildings and the fighting becomes hand-to-hand. That's when the colonel and other men arrive and turn the tide. Lots of people are hurt or killed, but the battle has ended.Chief Kowanen is speaking about how the fight was such a waste and he believes that neither side won. Adams comes forward carrying the dead body of Butler and dumps it at the chief's feet, explaining that it was the man who killed Keoga. The chief announces that too many people had died already because of that man and peace is re-established.Adams sends more than his contracted 20 paintings back to Boston with Cynthia and Agatha. Both Cynthia and Greta had come to the understanding that Adams wasn't interested in marrying either one of them and that he was choosing to stay there.Adams heads back to the Iroquois encampment where he marries Onida. Chief Kowanen and his wife Minikah inform Adams that he is now like a son to them and they have given him an Iroquois name: Keoga. The End
