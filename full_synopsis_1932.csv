                    A traveling circus has a wide variety of acts, including a number of sideshow curiosities based on some unusual physical attributes. They include midgets, limbless people, pinheads, conjoined twins, a bearded lady, and a half man/half woman. There are many interpersonal interactions between the entire troupe, those interactions which are generally amiable, although there are some who treat the curiosities merely as freaks. However, there are few romantic relationships between the ""normal"" troupe members and the curiosities. One of those exceptions is the budding romantic relationship between Hans and Cleopatra, one of the midgets and a trapeze artist respectively. What Hans is unaware of is that Cleopatra only fosters that relationship because of the expensive gifts he lavishes on her, while in reality she carries on with who is probably the antithesis of Hans physically, Hercules, the muscle man. A fellow midget, Frieda, who was once engaged to Hans and who she still loves, believes Cleopatra's interest in Hans is solely to make fun. But Frieda inadvertently provides Cleopatra with some information which changes Cleopatra's resolve instead to marry Hans. Hans' fellow sideshow curiosities do whatever they need to protect their dignity and that of one of their own.

On 22nd Street in Chicago, a gentleman is cleaning up a club where some men who are hanging out are discussing the fact that Johnny Lovo is looking for some action on the south side. This man is ""Big Louis"" who has done well for himself. He makes a phone call in a phone booth. A shadowy figure comes in from the right and guns him down, wipes his gun and leaves. The man cleaning up the club puts on his jacket and leaves to avoid any complications.A newspaper editor is putting out a story that ""Big"" Louis Costello has been killed, and that this is the beginning of a gang war. He was the last of the older generation of gangsters. He wants ""gang war"" in the lead copy.Some cops (led by Guarino) (C. Henry Gordon) come to a barbershop. and the barber hides a man's gun under a towel. The man, Tony Camonte (Paul Muni), makes sarcastic jokes with the police and lights a match off of the policeman's badge as a sign of disrespect. The cop punches him and places him under arrest. Down at the police station someone reads off Tony's police record, showing us that Tony Camonte is currently strong arm for Louis Costilo (Harry J. Vejar). Johnny Lovo split with ""Big"" Louis. Tony was seen with Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins) in a barber shop and what was he up to? He is released on habeus corpus by his lawyer, Fleming. He then visits Johnny Lovo. Johnny Lovo has a girlfriend named Poppy (Karen Morley) who is flippant with the two men. Johnny gives Tony some cash and tells him he's in for a raise as they move in on the south side. Tony want's to move in on O'Hara, a big deal on the north side but Johnny tells Tony to forget about having ideas of his own and to forget the north side. Johnny wants to wait until after Louis' funeral to have a meeting about running beer on the south side.Tony is paying someone off for an easy job about listening to a gun go off. He expresses disrespect of Johnny Lovo, and claims he will run the whole thing himself someday. He isn't intimidated by the north side, after all, why didn't they take out Big Louis first? there's only one rule; ""Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doing it""Tony is eating dinner at home. He is not happy his sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak) is not home. He then catches her making out with a guy inside the front door. He doesn't approve of her hanging out with guys, and offers her cash to have some fun with. She delightedly accepts, but mother warns her that Tony gives nothing away for free, the money is bad, and she will eventually get mixed up in some of Tony's business. She tells her mother not to worry, and that she will run her own life and be ok. She flips some money to a barrel organ player with a monkey on the street.Tony and Johnny and crew smash their way into dead Louis' club and take over. The start shaking down the local speakeasy and pigden joints and overselling their beer and telling them not to worry about Meehan and Berzini. There's a shootup at ""the Shamrock"". where presumably they took care of Meehan and Berzini. This should lock up the south side. But the newspaper indicates Meehan will live. They go to the hospital with flowers and gun down Meehan.A prop calander indicates the passing of a few months. Tony hits on Poppy again. She is charmed, but tells him to go get a girl. Johnny is mad that Tony took out a north side place because O'Hara is likely to come out and kill them. Just then on the street ""Keech"" is thrown out of a car with a message to ""Stay out of the north side"" pinned on him.Back at Tony's house, Camonte's dim-witted ""secretary"" or right hand man is putting on a hat, gets a call but doesn't get the name of who called. He banters with Tony about his inability to get the name of the caller. He gets a call again and it is not clear who it was. A man comes in with a carnation implying that he has done something to someone at a flower shop. The intercom buzzes, the dumb secretary again does not get the name. Tony takes it, it turns out to be Poppy who is waiting to come in. Tony removes the carnation to remove any connection to the flower shop hit. The man leaves and Poppy comes in. He gives the carnation to Poppy who says O'Hara was killed in a flower shop in the morning. He shows her his place with steal shutters. She notices he has an expensive bathrobe on. He's got a pile of shirts so he only wears a shit once a day. He's got a mattress with inside springs. He brags about a sign outside ""Cook Tours - The World is Yours"" and says someday the world will be his. Tony makes a move on Poppy but is interrupted by the announcement of the arrival of the cops. He sends Poppy down a secret exit and sets up a date on 4th street for when he is done with the cops. Guino Renaldo (George Raft) comes in. Tony instructs him to get a message to the lawyer to get him out on habeus corpus again.Meanwhile, a British crime lord named Gaffney, (Boris Karloff) is plotting against Tony. He has just gotten an overseas shipment of Thompson sub-machine guns. One of his men calls in to say he is being tailed and Gaffney plots to get the guns moving. Tony has gotten out of the police station and goes to the restaurant. A call comes into the restaurant for Tony which the dim-witted secretary goes to get - then, in a slapstick way he is still on the phone as the restaurant he is at is plastered with bullets from drive by cars. Somehow, he is unscathed.. Tony gets his hand on a machine gun that was lost by someone in the drive by and he sees that you can carry it and sees that it could be useful. He goes to a gang hideout, orders three cars, gets into a fight with Johnny and demonstrates the machine gun. He goes and makes hits on the north side people.The cops complain there's no law against making machine guns, just owning them. They decide to harass a warehouse where they think the machine guns are coming in. There are more hits with car accidents resulting - women screaming, chaos etc. (This is supposed to be on Valentine's day, a reference to the real life 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre.)He shoots seven men execution style. The cops have picked up Gafney who is amazed to see the seven bodies. A reporter finds Gafney in his hideout. Meanwhile the cops discuss how horrible the public's attitude to gangsters is, always being glorified. The cops try talking to the editor to keep gang violence out of the paper or otherwise complaining that the paper contributes to the problem. The editor defends the headlines and the editor makes an impassioned plea to the crowd in his office, presumably city hall types, that laws need to be passed or made tougher in order to change things and that it's in the hands of the people to fix the situation.Tony is with his men at a play where he takes an interest in Sadie Thompson, the main character in a play he is watching. He goes out for a smoke. There is one act left in the play but Tony's men have found Gafney down at the bowling alley and believe it's a setup. He reluctantly agrees to go deal with Gafney. Tony gives instructions for the hit down at the bowling alley as the secretary gets back with news about the 3rd act. Sadie ended up with the marine. Gangs of men begin to crowd around in the bowling alley and as Gafney tosses a bowling ball down the lane, machine gun fire cuts him down.Back at the Paradise nightclub, Tony and his men arrive. He spots Poppy having dinner with Johnny. He gets a chair pulled up. They both try and light Poppy's cigarette. Gunshots ring out in a scuffle a few tables away. It doesn't phase Tony at all - he's used to ""noises"". Tony's sister hits on Guino Renaldo. She does a seductve dance to entice him to dance with her but he still wants to stay away since she is Tony's sister. She goes with someone else. Tony steals Poppy out on to the dance floor from Johnny. Tony spots his sister on the floor with some guy and knocks him out. He takes her home and he has an argument where she indicates ""I'll do what I want"". It escalates. He hits her. Cesca runs into her mother's arms. The mother, who has a moral conscience, takes her upstairs to console her. Tony, who might actually feel guilty goes outside.As he gets outside, there is machine gun fire. He makes it to a car to escape but is followed. There is a car chase with a haze of bullets. He is gain unscathed. They go for his tires. and both cars go over an embankment. Tony has escaped to a store (Pietro's) where a man in the dark gives him some nickles to make calls for Renaldo or Lovo back at the club but they have left. He finds Renaldo with one of his girlfriends. He's suspicious Johnny Lovo put out a hit on him. He sets up a scheme where Pietro is going to call him while he is in his office claiming to be one of the guys who saw Tony get away and somehow this will give him away. This is presumably because the assumption is that Johnny wouldn't have known what members of the crew were out so he when he ducks the phone call in Tony's presence, it will give him away. It goes down as planned. After a confrontation, Johnny pleads for his life but Tony leaves having Renaldo shoot him.Tony goes to Poppy's place.

His sister, Cesca, sobbing hysterically, explains that she really loved him and they were married yesterday.

                    Johnny Lovo rises to the head of the bootlegging crime syndicate on the south side of Chicago following the murder of former head, Big Louis Costillo. Johnny contracted Big Louis' bodyguard, Tony Camonte, to make the hit on his boss. Tony becomes Johnny's second in command, and is not averse to killing anyone who gets in his and Johnny's way. As Tony is thinking bigger than Johnny and is not afraid of anyone or anything, Tony increasingly makes decisions on his own instead of following Johnny's orders, especially in not treading on the north side run by an Irish gang led by a man named O'Hara, of whom Johnny is afraid. Tony's murder spree increases, he taking out anyone who stands in his and Johnny's way of absolute control on the south side, and in Tony's view absolute control of the entire city. Tony's actions place an unspoken strain between Tony and Johnny to the point of the two knowing that they can't exist in their idealized world with the other. Tony's ultimate downfall may be one of two women in his life: Poppy, Johnny's girlfriend to who Tony is attracted; and Tony's eighteen year old sister, Cesca, who is self-professed to be older mentally than her years much to Tony's chagrin, he who will do anything to protect her innocence. Cesca ultimately comes to the realization that she is a lot more similar to her brother than she first imagined.

                    The prohibition of alcohol has led to a flourishing market of illegal liquors, dominated by organized crime. In Chicago the gangs control different parts of the city. As long as each gang limits its activities to its own district, there is peace between them. This balance of power is shattered, when the bodyguard Tony Camonte kills his boss Louis Costillo, and joins another gang. Tony helps his new boss, Johnny Lovo, to expand his market share by going into districts controlled by other gangs, kill their leaders and force pubs to buy illegal beer from Lovo instead. The situation quickly develops into an all-out war between the gangs. Tony wants to be the boss of the whole city. He starts disobeying Lovo, takes over his mistress Poppy, and finally kills Lovo. Tony is now the king, but he has one weak point: his overprotection of his 18-year-old sister Cesca. He forbids her to go out, and to flirt with men. When she breaks his commandments, he gets furious and forces her back home. In those situations he loses his watchfulness, makes mistakes, and is vulnerable for attacks from other gangs and the police.

    Synopsis
    The film opens with a statement that the film is an indictment of gang rule and a call to the individual to do something about it since the government is your government. On 22nd Street in Chicago, a gentleman is cleaning up a club where some men who are hanging out are discussing the fact that Johnny Lovo is looking for some action on the south side. This man is ""Big Louis"" who has done well for himself. He makes a phone call in a phone booth. A shadowy figure comes in from the right and guns him down, wipes his gun and leaves. The man cleaning up the club puts on his jacket and leaves to avoid any complications.A newspaper editor is putting out a story that ""Big"" Louis Costello has been killed, and that this is the beginning of a gang war. He was the last of the older generation of gangsters. He wants ""gang war"" in the lead copy.Some cops (led by Guarino) (C. Henry Gordon) come to a barbershop. and the barber hides a man's gun under a towel. The man, Tony Camonte (Paul Muni), makes sarcastic jokes with the police and lights a match off of the policeman's badge as a sign of disrespect. The cop punches him and places him under arrest. Down at the police station someone reads off Tony's police record, showing us that Tony Camonte is currently strong arm for Louis Costilo (Harry J. Vejar). Johnny Lovo split with ""Big"" Louis. Tony was seen with Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins) in a barber shop and what was he up to? He is released on habeus corpus by his lawyer, Fleming. He then visits Johnny Lovo. Johnny Lovo has a girlfriend named Poppy (Karen Morley) who is flippant with the two men. Johnny gives Tony some cash and tells him he's in for a raise as they move in on the south side. Tony want's to move in on O'Hara, a big deal on the north side but Johnny tells Tony to forget about having ideas of his own and to forget the north side. Johnny wants to wait until after Louis' funeral to have a meeting about running beer on the south side.Tony is paying someone off for an easy job about listening to a gun go off. He expresses disrespect of Johnny Lovo, and claims he will run the whole thing himself someday. He isn't intimidated by the north side, after all, why didn't they take out Big Louis first? there's only one rule; ""Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doing it""Tony is eating dinner at home. He is not happy his sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak) is not home. He then catches her making out with a guy inside the front door. He doesn't approve of her hanging out with guys, and offers her cash to have some fun with. She delightedly accepts, but mother warns her that Tony gives nothing away for free, the money is bad, and she will eventually get mixed up in some of Tony's business. She tells her mother not to worry, and that she will run her own life and be ok. She flips some money to a barrel organ player with a monkey on the street.Tony and Johnny and crew smash their way into dead Louis' club and take over. The start shaking down the local speakeasy and pigden joints and overselling their beer and telling them not to worry about Meehan and Berzini. There's a shootup at ""the Shamrock"". where presumably they took care of Meehan and Berzini. This should lock up the south side. But the newspaper indicates Meehan will live. They go to the hospital with flowers and gun down Meehan.A prop calander indicates the passing of a few months. Tony hits on Poppy again. She is charmed, but tells him to go get a girl. Johnny is mad that Tony took out a north side place because O'Hara is likely to come out and kill them. Just then on the street ""Keech"" is thrown out of a car with a message to ""Stay out of the north side"" pinned on him.Back at Tony's house, Camonte's dim-witted ""secretary"" or right hand man is putting on a hat, gets a call but doesn't get the name of who called. He banters with Tony about his inability to get the name of the caller. He gets a call again and it is not clear who it was. A man comes in with a carnation implying that he has done something to someone at a flower shop. The intercom buzzes, the dumb secretary again does not get the name. Tony takes it, it turns out to be Poppy who is waiting to come in. Tony removes the carnation to remove any connection to the flower shop hit. The man leaves and Poppy comes in. He gives the carnation to Poppy who says O'Hara was killed in a flower shop in the morning. He shows her his place with steal shutters. She notices he has an expensive bathrobe on. He's got a pile of shirts so he only wears a shit once a day. He's got a mattress with inside springs. He brags about a sign outside ""Cook Tours - The World is Yours"" and says someday the world will be his. Tony makes a move on Poppy but is interrupted by the announcement of the arrival of the cops. He sends Poppy down a secret exit and sets up a date on 4th street for when he is done with the cops. Guino Renaldo (George Raft) comes in. Tony instructs him to get a message to the lawyer to get him out on habeus corpus again.Meanwhile, a British crime lord named Gaffney, (Boris Karloff) is plotting against Tony. He has just gotten an overseas shipment of Thompson sub-machine guns. One of his men calls in to say he is being tailed and Gaffney plots to get the guns moving. Tony has gotten out of the police station and goes to the restaurant. A call comes into the restaurant for Tony which the dim-witted secretary goes to get - then, in a slapstick way he is still on the phone as the restaurant he is at is plastered with bullets from drive by cars. Somehow, he is unscathed.. Tony gets his hand on a machine gun that was lost by someone in the drive by and he sees that you can carry it and sees that it could be useful. He goes to a gang hideout, orders three cars, gets into a fight with Johnny and demonstrates the machine gun. He goes and makes hits on the north side people.The cops complain there's no law against making machine guns, just owning them. They decide to harass a warehouse where they think the machine guns are coming in. There are more hits with car accidents resulting - women screaming, chaos etc. (This is supposed to be on Valentine's day, a reference to the real life 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre.)He shoots seven men execution style. The cops have picked up Gafney who is amazed to see the seven bodies. A reporter finds Gafney in his hideout. Meanwhile the cops discuss how horrible the public's attitude to gangsters is, always being glorified. The cops try talking to the editor to keep gang violence out of the paper or otherwise complaining that the paper contributes to the problem. The editor defends the headlines and the editor makes an impassioned plea to the crowd in his office, presumably city hall types, that laws need to be passed or made tougher in order to change things and that it's in the hands of the people to fix the situation.Tony is with his men at a play where he takes an interest in Sadie Thompson, the main character in a play he is watching. He goes out for a smoke. There is one act left in the play but Tony's men have found Gafney down at the bowling alley and believe it's a setup. He reluctantly agrees to go deal with Gafney. Tony gives instructions for the hit down at the bowling alley as the secretary gets back with news about the 3rd act. Sadie ended up with the marine. Gangs of men begin to crowd around in the bowling alley and as Gafney tosses a bowling ball down the lane, machine gun fire cuts him down.Back at the Paradise nightclub, Tony and his men arrive. He spots Poppy having dinner with Johnny. He gets a chair pulled up. They both try and light Poppy's cigarette. Gunshots ring out in a scuffle a few tables away. It doesn't phase Tony at all - he's used to ""noises"". Tony's sister hits on Guino Renaldo. She does a seductve dance to entice him to dance with her but he still wants to stay away since she is Tony's sister. She goes with someone else. Tony steals Poppy out on to the dance floor from Johnny. Tony spots his sister on the floor with some guy and knocks him out. He takes her home and he has an argument where she indicates ""I'll do what I want"". It escalates. He hits her. Cesca runs into her mother's arms. The mother, who has a moral conscience, takes her upstairs to console her. Tony, who might actually feel guilty goes outside.As he gets outside, there is machine gun fire. He makes it to a car to escape but is followed. There is a car chase with a haze of bullets. He is gain unscathed. They go for his tires. and both cars go over an embankment. Tony has escaped to a store (Pietro's) where a man in the dark gives him some nickles to make calls for Renaldo or Lovo back at the club but they have left. He finds Renaldo with one of his girlfriends. He's suspicious Johnny Lovo put out a hit on him. He sets up a scheme where Pietro is going to call him while he is in his office claiming to be one of the guys who saw Tony get away and somehow this will give him away.

""In the moonstruck night light and shadow, voices and faces, seemed to take on hidden meaning. Allan Gray felt the darkness take control. In vain he tried to protect himself from unspeakable terror. Fear of the intangible followed him into a restless sleep."" Allan is awakened by a noise at his chamber door. A man enters, says only ""She must not die...do you hear?' and gives Allan a package on which is written ""To be opened after my death.""""What was going on? Which horrifying secret was revealing itself? One thing became clear to Allan Gray. A human soul in fear of Death cried for help--and an inner voice ordered him to follow its call."" Again, Allan goes snooping. He finds shadows--the shadow of a man UNdigging a hole, the shadow of a man with a wooden leg, shadow dancers. He hears barking dogs and a child wailing. The village Doctor [Jan Heironimko] appears and asks Allan: ""Did you hear it? There are no children or dogs here."" Allan leaves, and the man is joined by an old woman who gives him a bottle of poison.""(Allan) followed the shadows and entered a park. Among the ancient trees a chateau raised its towers into the haze of summer night. The man, whom Allan Gray had seen that same night at the inn, lived here in seclusion--with only his two daughters and a few servants."" The daughters (Gisèlle [Rena Handel] and Léone [Sybille Schmitz]) appear to be ill. The family awaits the arrival of the village Doctor. Gisèlle lies in her bed and cries out, ""The blood! The blood!"". The old man, lord of the manor [Maurice Schutz], is killed by the gun-carrying shadow. Allan is asked to stay with the family while a servant goes for the police.While he waits, Allan opens the mysterious package to find a book entitled ""The History of Vampires"" by Paul Bonnard. He reads ""...about horrendous demons called vampires. At full moon the Dead, not at peace because of terrible deeds they did while living, rise from their coffins--to suck the blood of children and young people--and prolong their own life in the land of the shadows. The Prince of Darkness is their companion, and...at night, creatures of the Abyss visit homes of the living to sow Death and Despair. Whoever falls into the hands of a vampire withers away hopelessly...a wound on the throat, as by a bite of a rat or a cat, is the mark of Damnation. Neither Doctors nor...""As Allan reads, Léone looks out the window to see Giselle wandering across the yard. Allan and Leone find her lifeless body and see an old woman walking away. While servants tend to the girl, Allan continues to read about vampires ""...to grow accustomed to their miserable fate--which, besides pain in the body, brings untold agony to the Soul. Therefore, like an epidemic, a vampire's craving for blood is carried over to the victim, who himself becomes a vampire and goes searching for more victims among his dear ones. Whole families, yes, whole villages, in this way have been sucked into the curse...Shadows of executed criminals are their helpers. Living people may also be forced to do their dreadful bidding. A tale from Hungary tells how a village Doctor, having sold his soul to The Evil One became the helper of a vampire--and was accomplice to a series of horrid crimes in that parish. Here, vampires...""The Doctor arrives and determines that Gisèlle needs blood. While Allan donates blood for a transfusion, the manservant reads from the book. ""The vampire, who had obtained complete power over its victim, tries in every possible way to drive it to suicide; for the one who takes his own life is lost for all eternity. For him, the golden gates of Heaven are closed--all hope is gone! Oh, you Devilish...the riddle of life? Who can penetrate the secrets hidden from the light of Day? Just as strange as the life of the vampires is the manner of breaking their might. These monsters, who cannot find peace, must be murdered so that persecuted Mankind may be freed from its nightmare. Many monasteries and libraries have, in their secret...how sometimes vampires have been made harmless. In the village of Kisiloba, which was haunted by a vampire in the body of an old woman, they went about it as follows. At dawn the grave was opened; they found the old one lying down, as if asleep. They drove a metal bar into her heart--and nailed her detestable soul to the crypt. She now died a true Death, and the crime, that rested over...Certain places were beset by vampires. Many years ago there was a foul epidemic in the village of Courtempierre--claiming eleven victims. Doctors gave the sickness a scientific name. Yet among men a rumour spread that a vampire was playing its game. People believed this vampire was one Marguerite Chopin [Henriette Gerard], buried in the village churchyard. All her life, Marguerite Chopin was a monster in a human body. She died without remorse, and at the hour of Death the Church refused her...""As Allan rests from his blood donation, a voice in the background is heard saying ""Come with me. We will be one soul...one body...death is waiting."" The manservant awakens Allan just in time for them to stop Gisèlle from taking the poison left at her bedside by the Doctor. Gisèlle must not die till sunrise. The Doctor escapes, but Allan follows. Allan's shadow separates from his body. He goes to the Doctor's house where he finds his own body in a coffin, and the body of Léone tied to a bed. As Allan's shadow watches, the Doctor and his wooden-legged helper nail shut the coffin. Is this actually happening, is it a memory or perhaps a dream induced by Allan's lack of blood?Now Allan watches the manservant digging up a grave, and he goes over to help. Is it his own grave? Will he find his own body? They open the grave to find the old woman's body. As the morning sun rises, the manservant drives a stake through Marquerite Chopin's body. Gisèlle sits up in bed. ""I feel strong,"" she says. ""My soul is free."" The man with the wooden leg falls down the stairs and is killed. The Doctor becomes entrapped and buried in a grain elevator. Allan unties Léone and they go home together. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]

"19","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023042/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","It is about 1922. Sergeant James Allen is returning home by boat to New York City after having served a stint in the Army and in World War One in Europe, being awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre. After taking part in a welcome home parade with fellow soldiers, he travels by train to his hometown in New Jersey.James is welcomed home by his mother, his prissy brother that is a Protestant minister, younger sister, and former boss from the factory he worked. His boss has reserved his old job as a shoe factory shipping clerk he had before joining the Army. Though it is a decent job and pays him over $50 a week, which was good money back in the early 1920's, James served in the Army Corps of Engineers and wants to do something more rewarding by building things, instead of a routine life of a desk job. Plus the war made him restless. Much to the dismay of his brother, who wants him to settle down and keep his steady job, his mother supports him and wants him to do what makes him happy and what his heart desires.James leaves his small New Jersey hometown for Boston and soon after being hired by a construction company, he is laid off. He then travels by boat to New Orleans and looks for a job at a construction site, but they are not hiring. After 4 months, James gets a temporary job driving a truck in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, but is soon laid off. He stops at a pawn shop in St. Louis attempting to get cash for his Belgian Croix De Guerre, but is rejected due to the box full of medals other former service members already pawned. He is last seen heading south. To avoid identity of the state, which was actually Georgia in the true life story of Robert Elliot Burns, it fades out around Kentucky and Tennessee on the map and James is seen walking on railroad tracks. After over a year of looking for work and taking up temporary jobs, he is now a homeless and penniless vagrant.James takes up residence in a homeless shelter in the fictional city of Stanton (a pseudonym for Atlanta) and meets a man named Pete that offers him to go for a handout at a lunch wagon for a hamburger. James heartily accepts and they go there with the owner reluctantly agreeing to give them a handout. Pete pulls a gun on the owner to rob his cash drawer and then on James forcing him to rob the $5. Pete is soon shot dead by local police. James instinctively runs from the scene, but the police arrest him.James is sentenced by the county judge 10 years imprisonment on the chain gang for the minor theft. Supposedly the diner owner either lied to the police or refused to testify for James for the incident, since he did see James forced to rob the register at the point of a gun.James is at a rural prison camp just outside of Stanton with leg shackles being attached to him by a blacksmith. At 4:20 the next morning, the guards are turning on the oil lanterns and waking up the prisoners, who are chained to their bed. James sleeps through the removal of the chains and is pushed by a guard and has his chain thrown in his face. He and the prisoners all go to eat breakfast, an abominable meal of pork fat, grease, a piece dough made out of flour and lard, and sorghum molasses, which helps make the food somewhat more tolerable. The meal is served for breakfast and dinner every single day.The black and white prisoners are separated from each other in housing and trucks that chain them drive to the worksites. The prisoners await the rising of the sun before getting to work. They are forced to chop rocks in a quarry for over 15 hours a day nonstop, with only a short restroom break with the approval of the guards and lunch break. James wipes sweat off his brow without permission from the guards and punched for it. He learns the ropes through an elderly prisoner named Bomber Wells, who injects a lot of humor into the situation. Another prisoner named Red, who is on the verge of dying from overwork, passes out and guards attempt to revive him by throwing cold water on him.It is 8:20 p.m. and the prisoners are dirty and exhausted from over 15 hours of work. The only bathing they have available is a galvanized steel tub full of water they rinse themselves in and share. James and the prisoners sit down to the same abominable meal they had for breakfast, this time enjoying it somewhat.After mealtime and at bedtime, the warden asks the guards to point out the prisoners that did not give them a good days work. Ackerman and Red are chosen. James calls the warden a skunk under his breath for wanting to whip Red, who is obviously on the verge of dying. Ackerman gets ten lashes and screaming, with his scarred and bloody back revealed. James is whipped instead of Red at least fifteen times and takes it stoically, to the admiration of the other prisoners.About one month later, prisoner Barney has now completed his sentence convincing the others they can get out alive by ""work out or die out"". Prisoner Red has also left, but in a pine box, having died from overwork. James is determined to break free from the prison, but Bomber advises him that he needs to wait weeks or even months to scout out the area and have a good plan before doing it.Several months pass and James asks a large black prisoner by the name of Sebastian to bend his shackles with a sledgehammer, while they're working on the railroad tracks. That night, James successfully pulls the shackles off. Bomber gives him $7 (almost $100 in 2013 dollars) and wishes him luck.That Monday, James asks the guard permission to ""get out here"", to use the bathroom. He takes his shackles off and makes a run for it. The guards gather up the bloodhounds and follow his trail. James conveniently finds a house with clothes on a clothesline to put on and take off his prison clothes to lose the dogs scent. He hides in a pond using a reed to breathe and is just inches away from a guard searching for him before the guard turns back.James successfully makes it to Stanton. A brief nighttime scene is seen of Atlanta's Forsyth Street with the Rialto Theater and Dixie Hotel. James is walking the streets cautiously and enters a men's clothing store for a suit and hat. Then he goes to a barber shop for a shave. A police officer enters and tells the barber there was a breakout on the chain gang. James leaves the barber shop without the police noticing him. Then he goes to a hotel to see his former fellow prisoner Barney, who has been free for the past several months. He is allegedly running a prostitution ring and offers James a comfortable bedroom, booze, and a nice lady for the night.The next day, James is enjoying a hamburger and soda at a stand near the train station. The Chief of Police makes a trip to search for him. Just as he is about to get on the train, the police are supposedly trying to catch him, but instead capture a bum nearby. As soon as he gets on the train, the porter asks for his ticket inquiring why he didn't see him and that there was an escaped prisoner search, but they didn't find him. Allegedly, the porter and another porter secretly converse that James could be the escaped prisoner, but they leave the room and nothing happens.James stops somewhere in Tennessee or Kentucky, then travels by vehicle and foot to Chicago. He applies for a menial job as a laborer at Tri State Construction, starting off at $4 a day as Allen James. After two years as a laborer, he is promoted to foreman at $7 a day.James goes to find a place for rent from a boarder, a flirtatious blonde lady by the name of Marie Woods, who is asking for $25 a month, but she lowers it to $20 and he accepts. Little does James know Marie is a scheming, manipulative sociopath that is about to make his life a living hell.James is spending his nights at home studying engineering and resisting Marie's advances. After 5 years with Tri State Construction company and promoted to Assistant Superintendent, James is about to leave the boardinghouse and tells Marie he doesn't love her, but she shows him a letter his brother wrote to him about his life on the chain gang. She promises she will never tell anybody his secret as long as he marries her.James has made well at his job pleasing his superiors with his project for building a bridge and made his way up to field superintendent. But despite that, Marie is spending all his money on booze, lavish dinners, men, and leaving the house a mess.James' boss invites his to a party dinner at the Club Chateau and he falls in love with a woman named Helen, who also likes him, but finds him a little strange and troubled.It is now 1930 and the beginning of the Great Depression. James has confessed to Marie he's in love with another woman and she continues to be a spendthrift and leave the house a mess. He wants an amicable divorce, but she refuses knowing she would lose all she has, even though he offers her what she wants. He loses it and tells her his life with her is just as bad as the chain gang and she storms out the door leaving him.The next day while at work and receiving an invitation to speak at a banquet, a detective barges in to James' office arresting him. Newspapers are on the screen about a fine citizen that has made good in Chicago being a wanted fugitive.While in jail, Allen has spoken to reporters about his life on a southern chain gang and swears by it. Chicago officials have refused his extradition back to the prison.The Chicago DA and Allen's lawyer, along with a shady Southern representative, are all in an office with the representative promising a pardon to Allen in 90 days if he voluntarily goes back to serve in a clerical job. His lawyer does not recommend it, but his girlfriend Helen says he should do it to clear his name. Allen decides to go back and the representative assures him it is a good decision he won't regret.Allen goes back to Stanton and his lawyer Ramsey is paid over $2,500 up front and tells Allen that the clerical job may not happen because of the criticism Allen made to the press about the chain gangs. The assurance of the pardon seems to be fading as wellAllen has been assigned to the Tuttle County prison camp. It turns out no promises have been kept for him and that the camp he is assigned to this time is even more harsh than the first one he was at. His old pal, Bomber Wells from the first prison, has been assigned to this one because of attempted assault on a guard at the first one. He and other fellow prisoners assure Allen there is no such thing as a pardon, but Allen remains somewhat hopeful. The next day, he and the prisoners are swinging sledgehammers with a fellow black prisoner singing ""Raise Them High"" to make the day more bearableAfter three months, the prison chairman, Lawyer Ramsey, Allen's brother, and three prison commission board members are present at a hearing about releasing Allen. Allen's brother weakly testifies he has made good despite his past, his lawyer says he's paid his part of the bargain and voluntarily returned to have his sentence commuted, but the chairman insists that the chain gang is a good character builder, crime must be punished, and that Allen made unwarranted and untrue attacks against the chain gang system. During the testimonies from Ramsey, Allen, and the chairman, all three prison commission board members sit with a glare of cold indifference on their face, making it evident they already had their minds made up before the hearing.The Reverend Allen visits James in his prison declaring the bad news he was rejected for release. Allen realizes he was lied to and that they just want revenge, but the Reverend tells him if he will be a model prisoner for nine more months, they will release him and be forced to through support of his fans.Allen perseveres and serves out his nine months. Lawyer Ramsey and the prison chairman meet with the three board members once again. Ramsey said Allen has served as a model prisoner and had letters from prominent officials and the three board members still sit with the same glare of cold indifference they did at the first hearing.Allen is in his bunk that night and by this time has grayed hair. and notified by the warden that the decision is suspended indefinitely and that he will have to serve the remainder of his sentence. Allen is beyond pained and crushed.Some time later, Allen dupes a dump truck driver at a quarry that there is a broken spring. He and Bomber hijack the truck and make a run for it. With a police car chasing them and a number of guards shooting at the truck, they use some dynamite in the truck to explode near one of the hills and slow down or stop the police car. Bomber is shot and falls out of the truck. Afterwards, Allen cuts his shackles off, then lights a bunch of dynamite and throws it at a bridge to keep the police from chasing him any further.Once again newspaper headlines flood the screen about Allen's second escape and being a hunted fugitive with the final one noting that it's been a year since his disappearance.One night, Helen pulls up in her garage and Allen calls out for her. He is now a broken and destitute man that is constantly moving from place to place and deprived of sleep just to avoid being found. Helen wants him to stay, but he insists he's still on the run and can't. He confesses he steals just to survive.","
    
                    Having returned from fighting in World War I, James Allen doesn't want to settle into a humdrum life and decides to set off to find his fortune.

His boss has reserved his old job as a shoe factory shipping clerk he had before joining the Army. Though it is a decent job and pays him over $50 a week, which was good money back in the early 1920's, James served in the Army Corps of Engineers and wants to do something more rewarding by building things, instead of a routine life of a desk job. Plus the war made him restless. Much to the dismay of his brother, who wants him to settle down and keep his steady job, his mother supports him and wants him to do what makes him happy and what his heart desires.James leaves his small New Jersey hometown for Boston and soon after being hired by a construction company, he is laid off. He then travels by boat to New Orleans and looks for a job at a construction site, but they are not hiring. After 4 months, James gets a temporary job driving a truck in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, but is soon laid off. He stops at a pawn shop in St. Louis attempting to get cash for his Belgian Croix De Guerre, but is rejected due to the box full of medals other former service members already pawned. He is last seen heading south. To avoid identity of the state, which was actually Georgia in the true life story of Robert Elliot Burns, it fades out around Kentucky and Tennessee on the map and James is seen walking on railroad tracks. After over a year of looking for work and taking up temporary jobs, he is now a homeless and penniless vagrant.James takes up residence in a homeless shelter in the fictional city of Stanton (a pseudonym for Atlanta) and meets a man named Pete that offers him to go for a handout at a lunch wagon for a hamburger. James heartily accepts and they go there with the owner reluctantly agreeing to give them a handout. Pete pulls a gun on the owner to rob his cash drawer and then on James forcing him to rob the $5. Pete is soon shot dead by local police. James instinctively runs from the scene, but the police arrest him.James is sentenced by the county judge 10 years imprisonment on the chain gang for the minor theft. Supposedly the diner owner either lied to the police or refused to testify for James for the incident, since he did see James forced to rob the register at the point of a gun.James is at a rural prison camp just outside of Stanton with leg shackles being attached to him by a blacksmith. At 4:20 the next morning, the guards are turning on the oil lanterns and waking up the prisoners, who are chained to their bed. James sleeps through the removal of the chains and is pushed by a guard and has his chain thrown in his face. He and the prisoners all go to eat breakfast, an abominable meal of pork fat, grease, a piece dough made out of flour and lard, and sorghum molasses, which helps make the food somewhat more tolerable. The meal is served for breakfast and dinner every single day.The black and white prisoners are separated from each other in housing and trucks that chain them drive to the worksites. The prisoners await the rising of the sun before getting to work. They are forced to chop rocks in a quarry for over 15 hours a day nonstop, with only a short restroom break with the approval of the guards and lunch break. James wipes sweat off his brow without permission from the guards and punched for it. He learns the ropes through an elderly prisoner named Bomber Wells, who injects a lot of humor into the situation. Another prisoner named Red, who is on the verge of dying from overwork, passes out and guards attempt to revive him by throwing cold water on him.It is 8:20 p.m. and the prisoners are dirty and exhausted from over 15 hours of work. The only bathing they have available is a galvanized steel tub full of water they rinse themselves in and share. James and the prisoners sit down to the same abominable meal they had for breakfast, this time enjoying it somewhat.After mealtime and at bedtime, the warden asks the guards to point out the prisoners that did not give them a good days work. Ackerman and Red are chosen. James calls the warden a skunk under his breath for wanting to whip Red, who is obviously on the verge of dying. Ackerman gets ten lashes and screaming, with his scarred and bloody back revealed. James is whipped instead of Red at least fifteen times and takes it stoically, to the admiration of the other prisoners.About one month later, prisoner Barney has now completed his sentence convincing the others they can get out alive by ""work out or die out"". Prisoner Red has also left, but in a pine box, having died from overwork. James is determined to break free from the prison, but Bomber advises him that he needs to wait weeks or even months to scout out the area and have a good plan before doing it.Several months pass and James asks a large black prisoner by the name of Sebastian to bend his shackles with a sledgehammer, while they're working on the railroad tracks. That night, James successfully pulls the shackles off. Bomber gives him $7 (almost $100 in 2013 dollars) and wishes him luck.That Monday, James asks the guard permission to ""get out here"", to use the bathroom. He takes his shackles off and makes a run for it. The guards gather up the bloodhounds and follow his trail. James conveniently finds a house with clothes on a clothesline to put on and take off his prison clothes to lose the dogs scent. He hides in a pond using a reed to breathe and is just inches away from a guard searching for him before the guard turns back.James successfully makes it to Stanton. A brief nighttime scene is seen of Atlanta's Forsyth Street with the Rialto Theater and Dixie Hotel. James is walking the streets cautiously and enters a men's clothing store for a suit and hat. Then he goes to a barber shop for a shave. A police officer enters and tells the barber there was a breakout on the chain gang. James leaves the barber shop without the police noticing him. Then he goes to a hotel to see his former fellow prisoner Barney, who has been free for the past several months. He is allegedly running a prostitution ring and offers James a comfortable bedroom, booze, and a nice lady for the night.The next day, James is enjoying a hamburger and soda at a stand near the train station. The Chief of Police makes a trip to search for him. Just as he is about to get on the train, the police are supposedly trying to catch him, but instead capture a bum nearby. As soon as he gets on the train, the porter asks for his ticket inquiring why he didn't see him and that there was an escaped prisoner search, but they didn't find him. Allegedly, the porter and another porter secretly converse that James could be the escaped prisoner, but they leave the room and nothing happens.James stops somewhere in Tennessee or Kentucky, then travels by vehicle and foot to Chicago. He applies for a menial job as a laborer at Tri State Construction, starting off at $4 a day as Allen James. After two years as a laborer, he is promoted to foreman at $7 a day.James goes to find a place for rent from a boarder, a flirtatious blonde lady by the name of Marie Woods, who is asking for $25 a month, but she lowers it to $20 and he accepts. Little does James know Marie is a scheming, manipulative sociopath that is about to make his life a living hell.James is spending his nights at home studying engineering and resisting Marie's advances. After 5 years with Tri State Construction company and promoted to Assistant Superintendent, James is about to leave the boardinghouse and tells Marie he doesn't love her, but she shows him a letter his brother wrote to him about his life on the chain gang. She promises she will never tell anybody his secret as long as he marries her.James has made well at his job pleasing his superiors with his project for building a bridge and made his way up to field superintendent. But despite that, Marie is spending all his money on booze, lavish dinners, men, and leaving the house a mess.James' boss invites his to a party dinner at the Club Chateau and he falls in love with a woman named Helen, who also likes him, but finds him a little strange and troubled.It is now 1930 and the beginning of the Great Depression. James has confessed to Marie he's in love with another woman and she continues to be a spendthrift and leave the house a mess. He wants an amicable divorce, but she refuses knowing she would lose all she has, even though he offers her what she wants. He loses it and tells her his life with her is just as bad as the chain gang and she storms out the door leaving him.The next day while at work and receiving an invitation to speak at a banquet, a detective barges in to James' office arresting him. Newspapers are on the screen about a fine citizen that has made good in Chicago being a wanted fugitive.While in jail, Allen has spoken to reporters about his life on a southern chain gang and swears by it. Chicago officials have refused his extradition back to the prison.The Chicago DA and Allen's lawyer, along with a shady Southern representative, are all in an office with the representative promising a pardon to Allen in 90 days if he voluntarily goes back to serve in a clerical job. His lawyer does not recommend it, but his girlfriend Helen says he should do it to clear his name. Allen decides to go back and the representative assures him it is a good decision he won't regret.Allen goes back to Stanton and his lawyer Ramsey is paid over $2,500 up front and tells Allen that the clerical job may not happen because of the criticism Allen made to the press about the chain gangs. The assurance of the pardon seems to be fading as wellAllen has been assigned to the Tuttle County prison camp. It turns out no promises have been kept for him and that the camp he is assigned to this time is even more harsh than the first one he was at. His old pal, Bomber Wells from the first prison, has been assigned to this one because of attempted assault on a guard at the first one. He and other fellow prisoners assure Allen there is no such thing as a pardon, but Allen remains somewhat hopeful. The next day, he and the prisoners are swinging sledgehammers with a fellow black prisoner singing ""Raise Them High"" to make the day more bearableAfter three months, the prison chairman, Lawyer Ramsey, Allen's brother, and three prison commission board members are present at a hearing about releasing Allen. Allen's brother weakly testifies he has made good despite his past, his lawyer says he's paid his part of the bargain and voluntarily returned to have his sentence commuted, but the chairman insists that the chain gang is a good character builder, crime must be punished, and that Allen made unwarranted and untrue attacks against the chain gang system. During the testimonies from Ramsey, Allen, and the chairman, all three prison commission board members sit with a glare of cold indifference on their face, making it evident they already had their minds made up before the hearing.The Reverend Allen visits James in his prison declaring the bad news he was rejected for release. Allen realizes he was lied to and that they just want revenge, but the Reverend tells him if he will be a model prisoner for nine more months, they will release him and be forced to through support of his fans.Allen perseveres and serves out his nine months. Lawyer Ramsey and the prison chairman meet with the three board members once again. Ramsey said Allen has served as a model prisoner and had letters from prominent officials and the three board members still sit with the same glare of cold indifference they did at the first hearing.Allen is in his bunk that night and by this time has grayed hair. and notified by the warden that the decision is suspended indefinitely and that he will have to serve the remainder of his sentence. Allen is beyond pained and crushed.Some time later, Allen dupes a dump truck driver at a quarry that there is a broken spring. He and Bomber hijack the truck and make a run for it. With a police car chasing them and a number of guards shooting at the truck, they use some dynamite in the truck to explode near one of the hills and slow down or stop the police car. Bomber is shot and falls out of the truck. Afterwards, Allen cuts his shackles off, then lights a bunch of dynamite and throws it at a bridge to keep the police from chasing him any further.Once again newspaper headlines flood the screen about Allen's second escape and being a hunted fugitive with the final one noting that it's been a year since his disappearance.One night, Helen pulls up in her garage and Allen calls out for her. He is now a broken and destitute man that is constantly moving from place to place and deprived of sleep just to avoid being found. Helen wants him to stay, but he insists he's still on the run and can't. He confesses he steals just to survive.

"27","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023369/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","One drop of rain falls to the ground, then more drops and finally the rain becomes heavy, filling the rain barrel. The rain falls on palm leaves and other tropical plants.We are in Pago Pago, a village in an American Samoa isle, where Marines are stationed.For residents of the village, life is simple, involving fishing.A steamer en route to another port, is temporarily quarantined there when one sailor appears to have contracted cholera. Because of the heavy rains, the ship must stay longer than anticipated. Five passengers on the boat must come ashore. They are Alfred Davidson (Walter Huston), a missionary, his wife Martha (Beulah Bondi), Dr. McPhail and his wife (Matt Moore and Kendall Lee), and Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford), a prostitute.The only accommodations are at a general store that doubles as a hotel, run by Joe Horn (Guy Kibbee) and his native wife (Mary Shaw). Mr. Horn is a genial and usually drunk innkeeper, who fusses, chortles, philosophizes, and who readily admits that he is escaping from America during the Prohibition years.On the boat prior to disembarking, the quartermaster receives some buddies from the Marine base, and he introduces them to Sadie, whom he had met in a Honolulu establishment of ill repute. They treat her like a friend, a comrade, not a lowly piece of scum or sexual object. Her interest is piqued by the shyest in the group, whom she names Handsome, although he is known as Sergeant Tim OHara (William Gargan). She smokes, jokes, and drinks with the guys, and asks them to take her belongings to the hotel.At the hotel, Sadie sets up her Victrola to play music and dances with Tim and others. Mrs. Davidson is annoyed at the antics of the wanton woman, and complains to Mr. Horn, but he says she is just a friendly person having fun. Mrs. Davidson then confronts the group telling them they should be ashamed to be partying up on the Sabbath. Sadie tells her to mind her own business, yet, in a spirit of compromise, moves the Victrola, music, and party into her own room.Mrs. Davidson persists in complaining about the intolerable noise to her husband. He goes to see the island governor, but is told there isnt any reason to evict the young woman, and anyway it will all stop in a few days.Dr. McPhail, who has a philosophical bent, and the innkeeper Mr. Horn have no objection to Sadie, and make mild comments in defense of her rights, but Mrs. Davidson hardens and insists that her husband put a stop to the activities in Sadies room immediately.The Reverend knocks at Sadies door and enters, shouting ensues, and the Reverend is forcibly ejected by the guys in Sadies room. She comes out and in no uncertain terms tells him to knock and wait to be invited in before he barges into a ladys private room, or else put up with what he got.Sadie Thompson, fights back like lightning whenever something or someone, like Davidson, objects to her lifestyle.The rain does not stop, the hotel guests must stay in close proximity to each other, and from time to time Sadie and the Reverend meet. When only the two of them are present, he talks calmly to her at first, almost sympathetically, because his pastoral duty is to convert sinners, not hate them. Again, at first, she responds well, saying she is sorry to make trouble, and wants to be a good person. But in repeated opportunities their initially respectful conversation turns ugly as he makes demands for an instant, complete turnaround in her behavior. Davidson finds is that his religious persistence annoys her and that Sadie can be as demanding and powerful as he in her responses.The Reverends frustration, amplified by his wifes entreaties, convince him to go back to the governor and threaten him with consequences if he doesnt get rid of Sadie, as the missionary claims to have powerful connections back in Washington.The governor, a weak man, as the Reverend describes him, acquiesces and orders Sadie deported back to San Francisco on the next available ship.Meantime, Tim has fallen in love with Sadie and talks to her about having a future together in Sydney, despite his knowledge of her past. He describes to her how one of his best buddies has married and has a family with a girl who used to work at the same establishment as Sadie, back in Honolulu.

When the boat, which was en route to another port, is temporarily stranded on the island due to a possible Cholera outbreak on-board, Sadie spends her time ""partying"" with the American soldiers stationed on the island. Her behavior, however, is more than the Davidsons can stand and soon Mr. Davidson confronts Sadie about her evil ways and offers salvation.

    Synopsis
    
One drop of rain falls to the ground, then more drops and finally the rain becomes heavy, filling the rain barrel. The rain falls on palm leaves and other tropical plants.We are in Pago Pago, a village in an American Samoa isle, where Marines are stationed.For residents of the village, life is simple, involving fishing.A steamer en route to another port, is temporarily quarantined there when one sailor appears to have contracted cholera. Because of the heavy rains, the ship must stay longer than anticipated. Five passengers on the boat must come ashore. They are Alfred Davidson (Walter Huston), a missionary, his wife Martha (Beulah Bondi), Dr. McPhail and his wife (Matt Moore and Kendall Lee), and Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford), a prostitute.The only accommodations are at a general store that doubles as a hotel, run by Joe Horn (Guy Kibbee) and his native wife (Mary Shaw). Mr. Horn is a genial and usually drunk innkeeper, who fusses, chortles, philosophizes, and who readily admits that he is escaping from America during the Prohibition years.On the boat prior to disembarking, the quartermaster receives some buddies from the Marine base, and he introduces them to Sadie, whom he had met in a Honolulu establishment of ill repute. They treat her like a friend, a comrade, not a lowly piece of scum or sexual object. Her interest is piqued by the shyest in the group, whom she names Handsome, although he is known as Sergeant Tim OHara (William Gargan). She smokes, jokes, and drinks with the guys, and asks them to take her belongings to the hotel.At the hotel, Sadie sets up her Victrola to play music and dances with Tim and others. Mrs. Davidson is annoyed at the antics of the wanton woman, and complains to Mr. Horn, but he says she is just a friendly person having fun. Mrs. Davidson then confronts the group telling them they should be ashamed to be partying up on the Sabbath. Sadie tells her to mind her own business, yet, in a spirit of compromise, moves the Victrola, music, and party into her own room.Mrs. Davidson persists in complaining about the intolerable noise to her husband. He goes to see the island governor, but is told there isnt any reason to evict the young woman, and anyway it will all stop in a few days.Dr. McPhail, who has a philosophical bent, and the innkeeper Mr. Horn have no objection to Sadie, and make mild comments in defense of her rights, but Mrs. Davidson hardens and insists that her husband put a stop to the activities in Sadies room immediately.The Reverend knocks at Sadies door and enters, shouting ensues, and the Reverend is forcibly ejected by the guys in Sadies room. She comes out and in no uncertain terms tells him to knock and wait to be invited in before he barges into a ladys private room, or else put up with what he got.Sadie Thompson, fights back like lightning whenever something or someone, like Davidson, objects to her lifestyle.The rain does not stop, the hotel guests must stay in close proximity to each other, and from time to time Sadie and the Reverend meet. When only the two of them are present, he talks calmly to her at first, almost sympathetically, because his pastoral duty is to convert sinners, not hate them. Again, at first, she responds well, saying she is sorry to make trouble, and wants to be a good person. But in repeated opportunities their initially respectful conversation turns ugly as he makes demands for an instant, complete turnaround in her behavior. Davidson finds is that his religious persistence annoys her and that Sadie can be as demanding and powerful as he in her responses.The Reverends frustration, amplified by his wifes entreaties, convince him to go back to the governor and threaten him with consequences if he doesnt get rid of Sadie, as the missionary claims to have powerful connections back in Washington.The governor, a weak man, as the Reverend describes him, acquiesces and orders Sadie deported back to San Francisco on the next available ship.Meantime, Tim has fallen in love with Sadie and talks to her about having a future together in Sydney, despite his knowledge of her past. He describes to her how one of his best buddies has married and has a family with a girl who used to work at the same establishment as Sadie, back in Honolulu. As that couple initially met ""illegally"", seeing each other at their worst, they can now appreciate seeing each other at their best.As Sadie has continued to meet with Tim and some of his buddies, and not given up music or dancing or drinking and smoking, the Reverend makes a formal complaint to the military authorities about Tim having attacked him, and Tim is sent to the brig.Sadie is fearful of being sent back to San Francisco, and is without support from Tim, so she weakens and returns to talk to the Reverend, pleading with him to let her wait for another ship a few days more and go to Sydney instead.The Reverend keeps asking her questions, and changes his emphasis somewhat, talking to her about Gods infinite love and forgiveness and the need for repentance about the past, rather than her current behavior, and he begins to have an influence on her.

                    Twelve Anglo-Saxon women who were members of the same sorority at St. Alban's Seminary have remained friends long after their days at the seminary. One person who did not remain friends with this group is half-caste Hindu Ursula Georgi, a woman who wanted to pass as white but was shunned by the group for her ethnicity. To get back at the group, Ursula, now working as the secretary for the renowned astrologist Swami Yogadachi, manages to get the women, through a series of round-robin letters, to ask the Swami to send each of them their horoscope. Regardless of the Swami's horoscope for each, Ursula instead sends them one of doom, often predicting their death or that of a loved one. The doomed predictions start to become self-fulfilling prophecies primarily through the mere suggestion, although Ursula does have some strong mystical powers of her own. The woman deemed to be the strongest of the group, single mother and Beverly Hills society matron Laura Stanhope, decides to gather the remaining group together as an act of defiance against the doomed predictions. What Laura does not tell her friends is that she too has fears about her horoscope, predicting the death of her son Bobby before his upcoming birthday in three days, especially after the Swami's prediction of a death not among the group does also come to pass. Knowing Laura's inner strength, Ursula takes some more direct measures to ensure the Swami's prediction for Bobby's death does happen. When Laura begins to realize that someone other than the Swami is really trying to kill Bobby, she turns to the police. Sergeant Barry Clive, who investigated another death among the group, takes it upon himself to find out what's going on and stop it before Bobby's predicted end.

                    Tom Collier has had a great relationship with Daisy, but when he decides to marry, it is not Daisy whom he asks, it is Cecelia. After the marriage, Tom is bored with the social scene and the obligations of his life. He publishes books that will sell, not books that he wants to write. Even worse, he has his old friend working as a butler and Cecelia wants him fired. When Tom tries to get back together with Daisy to renew the feelings that he once felt, Daisy turns the tables on him and leaves to protect both of them.

However, while she was away, Tom, who believed their relationship was destined to be only as platonic best friends because of Daisy's continual refusals, ended up meeting and falling in love with Cecelia Henry, to who he is instead getting married. Tom does not want to give up his friendship with Daisy, which he believes transcends convention. Daisy is uncertain if they can remain friends or if Cecelia would like it. What little he knows about Tom's life, Tom's wealthy father, Rufus Collier, doesn't truly understand or like, but believes refined Cee, as all that know her refer to Cecelia, will be a good influence on Tom. Conversely, Tom doesn't much like what his father represents. Several months later after Tom and Cee have settled into married life... Tom doesn't much like Cee's pretentious friends. In turn, they no longer associate with Tom's bohemian friends, except Tom's butler, ""Red"" Regan, a former prize fighter who Tom hired despite he being a little rough around the edges to be a butler. Cee and Red have an unspoken dislike for each other. Daisy, on the most part, has stayed out of their lives as she still loves Tom. Tom, largely in order to please Cee, is now publishing dime store novels, which he doesn't like but which make money. Cee, in turn, uses her coy sexuality to get Tom to do what she wants. What little Tom's friends know about his current life they don't much like as they feel he has lost his integrity, all of Cee's doing. The question becomes if Tom has or will come to the same conclusion and if he does what he will do about it.

The boys get off to a rocky start in their new neighborhood as they end up being bullied by a group of similarly aged boys, led by slightly bigger Kamekichi. Keiji and Ryoichi even secretly play hooky from school, not wanting to have to confront the bullies. After befriending Kozou, the older delivery boy at the local store who ends up being their protector of sorts, Keiji and Ryoichi are able to stand up to their tormentors to become the ones among the boys who call the shots. Their newfound pride takes a hit when they end up being at the same social gathering as their father and his coworkers at Iwasaki's house, and see that their father is a proverbial apple-polisher toward Iwasaki and not the important man they previously believed him to be.

Ever with her eye toward the harbor, Butterfly holds a secret delight that she eagerly wishes to surprise her husband with: their son. Pinkerton arrives in Japan with his American bride by his side.

She is amazed to see on a cobweb-covered table, a new telephone, and as she enters the dining-room, where rats are gnawing the decayed remains of a sumptuous feast laid out years ago for thirteen guests, she is also surprised to find that electric lights have been installed. She sits in the thirteenth chair and reconstructs the scene of thirteen years before, when she, as a young girl, sat at the side of her father who died at the table after reading a mysterious will. Outside two people climb out of an unlighted car and enter the house. Screams pierce the night air, and her cab driver goes for the police. The police find Marie dead at her place at the table. Police Captain Ryan calls in criminologist Phil Winston to assist him in the investigation. Police officers bring in Harold 'Bud' Morgan, brother of the girl, and his friend, Thor Jensen, both also guests at the fatal meal thirteen years before. They identify the body and cast suspicions upon family lawyer Robert Barksdale. Order are given to pick up Barksdale who is later found dead at his original place at the table. Winston is called, and as he arrives, police officers bring in Marie Morgan, the supposedly dead girl, who explains that she was frightened away by the screams when she was there and has just come out of hiding. Winston determines that a double was substituted for her at the table, and takes her to his apartment where he persuades her to call the surviving members of the dinner to come to his apartment. First to arrive is Uncle John Adams, who Marie describes as mean enough to kill anybody, followed by Aunt Jane and Uncle Dick Thornton and their daughter Marjorie. Harold and Thor also arrive. Finding them unwilling to assist and inclined to make a joke of the whole affair, Winston orders their confinement, but later has them released with a police officer ordered to shadow each one. The trail leads back to the old house, when Marie is given a false message to meet Winston there. Winston rescues her from a secret room and the clutches of the killer, and finds that the motive had been the attempted theft of a combination in her possession which unlocked a vault containing keys to a safe-deposit box disclosing her as the beneficiary of a will made prior to the dinner party 13 years before.

                    It's the 1930s, the Depression era, and the Board of Directors of Thomas Dickson's bank want Dickson to merge with New York Trust and resign. He refuses. One night, Dickson's bank is robbed of $100,000. The suspect is Matt Brown, an ex-convict whom Dickson hired and appointed Chief Teller. Brown, who's very loyal to Dickson, refuses to say where he was that night. He actually has two witnesses for his alibi, Mrs. Dickson and fellow worker Cyril Cluett, but Brown is protecting Dickson from finding out that Mrs. Dickson was with Cluett having a romantic evening. Cluett, who has a $50,000 gambling debt, is actually responsible for the robbery, but lets Brown take the rap. Will Brown's loyalty to Mr. Dickson pay off, or send him back to prison?

In turn, his employees and the bank's clients are fiercely loyal to Tom and the bank. The bank's Board of Directors have a different view. They accuse Tom of being reckless, especially in being overly liberal in approving what they consider questionable loans. Tom defends his loan policy, stating that money in circulation is what is needed to help the country get out of the depression. The Board will do whatever it needs to to remove Tom from his position. When the bank is robbed of $200,000, one of Tom's most loyal employees, Matt Brown, the newly appointed assistant head cashier, is implicated as the thief, although Tom believes Matt is innocent. Although Matt does not know who committed the robbery, he is reluctant to defend himself if only to protect Tom from information concerning head cashier Cyril Cluett and Tom's neglected wife, Phyllis. The robbery, however, has wider effects in that it starts a chain of events that could ruin the bank. Tom has to figure out how to save the bank, while evaluating his priorities in light of information that comes to his attention about his home life.

                    Selina lived well until her father Simeon died. Her aunts sold the estate and put her in a boarding school. As an adult she wants to be a teacher in farming country. She falls in love with and marries Pervus, a Dutch farmer she has been tutoring. When he dies her hopes lie with their son Dirk, who disappoints her by giving up architecture for stock brokerage. Her new hope is Roelfe, the son of her former boardinghouse keeper and a sculptor. Dirk falls in love with Dallas O'Mara, whom Selina hopes will be the inspiration for her son's salvation.

                    In the 1890s, Selina Peake was being raised in Chicago by her widowed father, who lost everything to gambling. He is killed when Selina is a young woman, leaving her penniless and forced to take a job as a schoolteacher in a small Dutch community. Selina takes room and board with the Poole family, whose young teen son, Roelf, works the family farm rather than attend school. Selina soon begins tutoring Roelf, who is already artistic and thirsts after knowledge, and opens his mind to literature, art, and culture. He develops a schoolboy crush on her. ¶ Selina meets Pervus De Jong at a church fund raiser, and she agrees to tutor him in math to enable him to make better deals at the hay-market. It isn't long before he begins courting Selina, breaking Roelf's heart. Selina and Pervus marry and live a hardscrabble life working their farm. Selina gives birth to a 10-lb son they name Dirk, lovingly nicknamed So Big. Roelf leaves home when his mother dies, as he feels the life of farming is what killed her. Still a teenager, he strikes out on his own. ¶ When Pervus leaves Selina a young widow, her efforts to run the farm on her own are met with discouragement by the menfolk in town; the hay-market is considered no place for a woman. But she dreams of a proper education for So Big, and is determined to succeed. She does so by giving up on cabbages and radishes in favor of developing a thriving asparagus farm. ¶ Dirk graduates from college with a degree in architecture. He enjoys the high life, and thus laments his meager pay in an architecture firm. Selina encourages him to stick with it, but the married woman Dirk is involved with entices him to leave architecture to join her husband's investment firm. He becomes assistant manager, and he does well for himself, but he is unhappy with his life. He hires artist Dallas O'Mara to create an ad for the firm. She is shocked and disappointed that he would give up architecture for finance. He falls in love with her, but she refuses to marry him because he isn't willing to really work for a living. ¶ Dallas introduces Dirk to her old friend, Roelf Poole, who has become a renowned sculptor in Europe. Roelf realizes Dirk is the same child he knew as So Big all those years ago. He is keen to reunite with his former tutor, and invites Dirk to join him and Dallas on the visit. Dirk looks on with humility and Dallas with admiration as Selina and Roelf exchange praise for their respective accomplishments. She is pleased and humbled to learn that Roelf owes his success to her influence. Dallas observes that Selina is possessed of the distinguished beauty that is only afforded to those who carry a light inside and have the calloused hands to show for it.

Undercover, John hangs around the area's biggest town as a drifter and a drunk. His investigation centers around two factions doing the rustling; Sonora Joe, a philosophical and flamboyant stock taker and, the less obvious but more dangerous, cattle-and-land baron Sam Crew, who poses as a respectable citizen while employing the likes of Arizona Frank Bailey to do his dirty work. News reaches town that a wagon train of settlers with 5,000 head of cattle is on the trail. John joins the pioneers, becoming close friends with the train's leader, Cal Brett and his niece Ginger Malloy. Arizona and his men raid the camp and Brett is killed by Arizona in the ensuing gun battle. Sonora Joe and his vaqueros, atop a nearby hill, watch the battle and decide the herd is ripe for their picking. The resourceful John and his marvel horse Duke save the herd. Visiting Sonora's camp the next morning. John reveals his identity and offers to make Sonora a deputy so they might bring Arizoa to justice. The bemused Sonora accepts and assists John in arresting Arizona at the El Dorado saloon and he is sent to Fort Cummings for trial. Crew, determined to get the big herd, has John taken prisoner, and rounds up every gunman in the Valley and rides after the herd. But Duke, not known as the Miracle Horse for nothing, races to Sonora's camp and leads him and his vaqueros to the rescue. This film was a remake of 1927's ""The Land Beyond the Law"" and most of the action footage involving John Wayne and Duke in this film is stock footage of Ken Maynard and Tarzan from the 1927 film.

Mickey's grandmother recently died, and he is about to be taken away by Mrs. Berger to the orphanage. He chooses to go with Annie to the shack where she and Daddy Warbucks live. She feeds him leftover pig's feet, cream puff and assorted food, but by the next morning he has a stomach ache. Annie takes him to an orphanage where he will be taken care of, but is herself is taken into custody. While in the orphanage, Annie takes care of Mickey. One day, Mrs. Stewart (a rich dowager) appears, wanting to adopt. The children a paraded before her. Hearing of her contrary nature, Annie makes sure that Mickey catches her attention by saying bad things about him, and by the end of the interview, Mrs. Stewart adopts him. In the orphanage, Annie misses Mickey, and although she's written four letters, Mickey has not responded (because he can't write). Meanwhile, in Mrs. Stewart's home, Mickey is happy, but appears to be angry with Annie, for having said the bad things about him in the adoption process. Annie decides to visit Mickey, and appears by his window just after he's been put to bed since Mrs. Stewart is holding a dinner party. Annie tries to reconcile with Mickey who brings Annie into the house. They pass by the kitchen where Annie takes some cheese dip and Sandy makes off with the main course, a roast beef. The dinner party guests tell about their brushes with supernatural apparitions, although Mrs. Stewart doesn't believe a word of it. Meanwhile, Mickey and Annie find themselves in Mrs. Stewart's bedroom, where Sandy performs tricks for Mickey, and Annie does imitations of Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Groucho Marx (from the film Horse Feathers (1932)) and Mrs. Stewart. The dinner party ends with the guests humorously wondering if the missing roast beef was also a supernatural occurrence. Upon hearing them leave, Mickey quickly gets back into bed, Sandy goes into Mrs. Stewart's closet, and Annie is stuck in her room. While Mrs. Stewart reads, she sees what she think is an apparition (really just Annie trying to escape stealthily). Mrs. Stewart makes her way to her room, but as she's preparing for bed she sees a ghostly figure (Sandy in a sheet) escape from the closet it door. After a bit of rambunctious chasing, Mrs. Stewart confronts Annie asking her what she's doing in the house. Annie is ejected, but Mickey now doesn't want Annie to go. As he tries to call to her from his second floor window, Mickey falls out of the window to everyone's horror. After some doubt, the doctor declares he will survives and will be able to remove a brace by Christmas. It's Christmas, Mickey is now back to health, and Mrs. Stewart has thrown a party for all the orphans from the orphanage, including Annie. Suspecting something odd, Annie walks up to Santa and discovers it's really Daddy Warbucks. The film ends happily for all.

When she finds she is pregnant, she considers her options: suicide, to raise the child on her own, to wait for Marius, or to marry Honoré Panisse, the older merchant who seeks her hand. These choices are emotional: to raise a bastard, to trust in Marius' eventual return, to believe he'll want to marry her, to save her mother from shame, to fool Panisse, to give her child a name. In scenes dramatizing Fanny's honesty, she talks to her mother, then Panisse, César, and later Marius, and she makes her choices.
