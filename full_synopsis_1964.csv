"2","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","At the Burpelson U.S. Air Force Base somewhere in the continental USA, the eccentric Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders the 34 nuclear-armed B-52's of the 843rd Bomb Wing past their failsafe points where they normally hold awaiting possible orders to proceed and into Soviet airspace. He also tells the personnel on the base that the US and the USSR have entered into a ""shooting war"".In the ""War Room"" at The Pentagon, Air Force General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) about the attack that General Ripper ordered. Although a nuclear attack should require Presidential authority to be initiated, Ripper used ""Plan R"", an emergency war plan enabling a senior officer to launch a retaliation strike against the Soviets if everyone in the normal chain of command, including the President, has been killed during a sneak attack. Plan R was intended to discourage the Soviets from launching a decapitation strike against the President in Washington to disrupt U.S. command and control and stop an American nuclear counterattack. Turgidson tries to convince Muffley to take advantage of the situation to eliminate the Soviets as a threat by launching a full-scale attack. Turgidson believes that the United States is in a superior strategic position, and a first strike against the Soviet Union would destroy 90% of their missiles before they could retaliate, resulting in a victory for the U.S. with ""acceptable"" American casualties of ""no more than 10 to 20 million killed, tops... depending on the breaks"". He is rebuked when Muffley instead admits the Soviet Ambassador (Peter Bull) to the War Room, contacts Soviet Premier Dmitri Kissoff on the hotline, and insists on giving the Soviets all the information necessary to shoot down the American planes before they can carry out their strikes.Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (also played by Peter Sellers), an RAF exchange officer serving as General Ripper's executive officer, realizes that there has been no attack on the U.S. when he turns on a radio and hears pop music instead of Civil Defense alerts. When Mandrake reveals this to Ripper, and Ripper refuses to recall the wing, Mandrake announces that he will issue the recall on his own authority, but only Ripper knows the three-letter code necessary for recalling the bombers and locks the two of them in his office. Mandrake tries to convince Ripper to give up the three letter code. The psychotic Ripper refuses and rambles on that the Communists have a plan to ""sap and impurify"" the ""precious bodily fluids"" of the American people with fluoridated water, a theory that occurred to him during sexual intercourse, and which he believed to be the cause of his post-coital fatigue.Over the phone, an unseen and drunken Kissoff reveals to the Soviet Ambassador that their country has installed an active ""Doomsday Device"" which will automatically destroy all human and animal life on Earth if a nuclear attack were to hit the Soviet Union. The Doomsday Device is operated by a network of computers and has been conceived as the ultimate deterrent: as a safeguard, it cannot be deactivated, or it will set itself off, because its hardware and programs have been configured in such a way that an attempt at its deactivation would be recognized as sabotage. The doomsday weapon is described as based on ""cobalt-thorium-G"" [this was inspired by the real idea of a cobalt bomb, conceived by nuclear pioneer Leo Szilard, founder of Council for a Livable World]. According to the Soviet ambassador, life on Earth's surface will be extinct in ten months and was made as a low cost alternative to the bomb-race.The President now calls upon Dr. Strangelove (a.k.a. Merkwürdigeliebe), a former Nazi and strategy expert (Sellers in his third role). The wheelchair-bound Strangelove is a type of ""mad scientist"", whose eccentricities include a severe case of alien hand syndrome, so that his right hand, clad in an ominous black leather glove, occasionally attempts to strangle Strangelove or make the Nazi salute (no one in the room acts if this is unsusual). Strangelove also slips in addressing the President, as either ""Mein President"" or even ""Mein Führer"".Strangelove explains the principles behind the Doomsday Device, which he says is ""simple to understand... credible and convincing"". He also points out that a Doomsday Device kept secret has no value as a deterrent; the Soviet Ambassador admits that his government had installed it a few days before they were going to announce it publicly to the world, because Kissoff ""loves surprises"".U.S. Army paratroopers sent by the President arrive at Burpelson to arrest General Ripper. Because Ripper has warned his men that the enemy might attack disguised as American soldiers, the base's security forces, and Ripper himself with a .50 caliber M1919 Browning machine gun kept in his golf bag, open fire on them. After a fierce firefight the Army forces win the battle and gain access to the base, and Ripper, fearing torture to extract the recall code commits suicide. Colonel ""Bat"" Guano (Keenan Wynn) shoots his way into Ripper's office, but suspects that Mandrake, whose uniform he does not recognize, is leading a mutiny of ""deviated preverts"" and proceeds to arrest him. Mandrake convinces Guano that he has to call the President to tell him the recall code, which he has deduced from Ripper's desk blotter doodles to be based on the initials for the phrases peace on earth and purity of essence. Since office phone connections had been knocked out by the fighting at the base, Mandrake is forced to use a pay phone to try to contact the President. Not having the correct change to place a long-distance call to the Pentagon, Mandrake persuades Guano to shoot a Coca-Cola vending machine to get the change out of it, and eventually is able to forward the likely code combinations to Strategic Air Command.The correct recall code, ""OPE"", is issued to the planes, and those that have not been shot down return to base except for one. Its radio and fuel tanks were damaged by a Soviet anti-aircraft missile, with the result that the plane is neither able to receive the recall code nor to reach its primary or secondary target where, at the urging of the U.S. President, the Soviets have concentrated all available defenses. On the crew's own initiative, and losing fuel, the plane proceeds to fly at low level under radar to a closer target of opportunity.As they start their bomb run, the damaged B-52's bomb bay doors will not open, and aircraft commander Major T. J. ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens) goes down to the bomb bay to open them himself. He succeeds just as the plane reaches its target, and one of the nuclear bombs falls, with Kong still sitting on it. He straddles the bomb and rides it to the ground like a rodeo cowboy, whooping and hollering and waving his cowboy hat. The bomb explodes, triggering the Doomsday Machine.Back in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends to the President that a select group of about 200,000 or more people be relocated into a deep mine shaft, where the nuclear fallout cannot reach them, so that the U.S. can be repopulated afterwards. Because of space limitations, Strangelove suggests a gender ratio of ""ten females to each male"", with the women selected for their sexual characteristics, and the men selected on the basis of their physical strength, intellectual capabilities, and importance in business and government. General Turgidson rants that the Soviets will likely create an even better bunker than the U.S., and argues that America ""must not allow a mine shaft gap"". Meanwhile, the Soviet Ambassador retreats to a corner of the War Room and starts taking pictures with a spy camera disguised as a pocket watch.A visibly excited Dr. Strangelove bolts out of his wheelchair, shouting ""Mein Führer, I can walk!"". Abruptly, the film ends with a barrage of nuclear explosions, accompanied by Vera Lynn's famous World War II song ""We'll Meet Again"".","
    
                    Paranoid Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper of Burpelson Air Force Base, believing that fluoridation of the American water supply is a Soviet plot to poison the U.S. populace, is able to deploy through a back door mechanism a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union without the knowledge of his superiors, including the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Buck Turgidson, and President Merkin Muffley. Only Ripper knows the code to recall the B-52 bombers and he has shut down communication in and out of Burpelson as a measure to protect this attack. Ripper's executive officer, RAF Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (on exchange from Britain), who is being held at Burpelson by Ripper, believes he knows the recall codes if he can only get a message to the outside world. Meanwhile at the Pentagon War Room, key persons including Muffley, Turgidson and nuclear scientist and adviser, a former Nazi named Dr. Strangelove, are discussing measures to stop the attack or mitigate its blow-up into an all out nuclear war with the Soviets. Against Turgidson's wishes, Muffley brings Soviet Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky into the War Room, and get his boss, Soviet Premier Dimitri Kisov, on the hot line to inform him of what's going on. The Americans in the War Room are dismayed to learn that the Soviets have an as yet unannounced Doomsday Device to detonate if any of their key targets are hit. As Ripper, Mandrake and those in the War Room try and work the situation to their end goal, Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, one of the B-52 bomber pilots, is working on his own agenda of deploying his bomb where ever he can on enemy soil if he can't make it to his intended target.

                    U.S. Air Force General Jack Ripper goes completely and utterly mad, and sends his bomber wing to destroy the U.S.S.R. He suspects that the communists are conspiring to pollute the ""precious bodily fluids"" of the American people. The U.S. president meets with his advisors, where the Soviet ambassador tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a ""Doomsday Machine"" which will destroy all plant and animal life on Earth. Peter Sellers portrays the three men who might avert this tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating a drunken Soviet Premier and the former Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove, who concludes that ""such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious"". Will the bombers be stopped in time, or will General Jack Ripper succeed in destroying the world ?

The hydrogen bomb....Well, now, what happened is that, uh, one of our base commanders...he went a little funny in the head....and he went and did a silly thing....He ordered his planes to attack your country."" A comedy about an accidental nuclear attack? One that ends with total annihilation, thermonuclear apocalypse? Preposterous! Stanley Kubrick thought otherwise. In the end his thinking prevailed. The mad saga revolves around a psychotic Strategic Air Command officer, Gen. Jack D. Ripper, who lets loose his B-52 bomber squadron on the Soviet Union. Ripper takes this unilateral action because of his paranoid belief that Communists are sapping and contaminating ""all our precious bodily fluids"" as part of their plan to take over the world. Unbeknownst to Ripper, his attack will trigger the Russian's ultimate weapon, the Doomsday Machine, a diabolical retaliatory device set to blow up the planet.

Higgins, who dislikes the pretentiousness of the upper class, partly conceals a grin behind his hand, as if to say ""I wish I had said that!""The bet is won when Eliza successfully poses as a mysterious lady of patently noble rank at an embassy ball, despite the unexpected presence of a Hungarian phonetics expert trained by Higgins. Higgins's callous treatment of Eliza afterwards, especially his indifference to her future prospects, leads her to walk out on him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude. When she is gone however, he comes to the horrified realization that he has ""grown accustomed to her face."" Putting aside his resentment about the intrusion on his life and toward women in general, Higgins finds Eliza the next day and attempts to talk her into coming back to him. During a testy exchange, Higgins's ego gets the better of him, and his former student rejects him.Higgins makes his way home, stubbornly predicting that Eliza will be ruined without him and come crawling back. However, his bravado collapses and he is reduced to playing old phonograph recordings of her voice lessons. To Higgins' great delight, Eliza chooses that moment to return to him.

    Synopsis
    A Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood), arrives at a little Mexican border town named San Miguel. He is quickly introduced to the feud between two families vying to gain control of the town: the Rojo brothers, consisting of Don Miguel (Antonio Prieto) (the eldest and nominally in charge), Esteban (Sieghardt Rupp) (the most headstrong) and Ramón (the most capable and intelligent, played by Gian Maria Volontè, who would reappear in For a Few Dollars More as the psychopathic El Indio), and the family of so-called ""town sheriff"" John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy).The Stranger quickly spies an opportunity to make a ""fistful of dollars"" and decides to play both families against each other.

"5","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The pre-title teaser sequence shows Bond emerging from the water in a Latin American country. His mission is to destroy the operations of a drug lord, who deals heroin to finance revolutions. Bond infiltrates the man's secret lab and lays out a large quantity of C4 explosive with a timer. Shortly after he meets his contact in a nearby bar, the bomb explodes, destroying much of the drug lord's base of operations. Bond's contact tells him his flight to Miami is confirmed and Bond follows an exotic dancer (his lover on the mission) to her dressing room. Bond takes off his shoulder holster and pistol and kisses the woman. A man emerges from behind an armoire and attacks Bond, who holds the woman up as a shield. He struggles briefly with the henchman and throws him into the bathtub. The man seizes Bond's gun, prompting Bond to throw an electric heater in the water-filled tub, electrocuting the man. Bond leaves, plainly disgusted with the woman who betrayed him.Bond's CIA contact, Felix Leiter, finds the agent in Miami Beach on respite. He informs Bond that M had charged him with a new mission; the observation of a man named Auric Goldfinger (Goldfinger), an international jeweler who is suspected of smuggling. Bond charms his way into Goldfinger's hotel room and finds Jill Masterson, Goldfinger's mistress, watching him play cards through a set of binoculars. From her vantage point, Jill can see Goldfinger's opponent's hand and can relay instructions to Goldfinger, allowing him to cheat and win. Bond disrupts Jill's spying, telling Goldfinger that the Miami Beach police department would arrest him if they found out his scheme. He also orders Goldfinger to begin losing gradually to his opponent.Bond invites Jill back to his own hotel room where they spend the afternoon and evening together. While Bond retrieves another bottle of champagne, he is hit from behind and falls unconscious. (A shadow on the wall shows a bulky figure wearing a brimmed hat.) When Bond awakes, he finds that Jill has been murdered; her entire body has been covered in gold paint and she has died of skin suffocation. Bond calls Leiter immediately to report the incident.Bond reports back to London, meeting with M, who is largely disappointed at the turn of events. He threatens to replace Bond on the mission with 008, however, Bond reassures his boss that he can complete the mission himself. M orders Bond to attend a dinner meeting with a representative from the British Office of Finance to learn more about Goldfinger. As it turns out, the tycoon is a legitimate jeweler and thereby permitted to trade and refine gold legally around the world, yet his means of transporting his gold internationally remains unknown and Bond's mission is to prove if Goldfinger is smuggling his gold illegally. Bond suggests that he and his adversary meet socially and that he'll need some sort of bait to entice Goldfinger. The representative suggests a gold bar smelted by the Nazis during World War II.Bond makes a brief visit to the lab of his weapons specialist, Q, who provides him with two tracking devices and a new car, a 1964 Aston Martin DB5. The car comes equipped with a tracking screen for the bugs that were given to Bond as well as a formidable weapons system (machine guns, oil slick, smokescreen, passenger ejector seat, & tire slashers) as well as bulletproof glass and revolving license plates.Bond meets Goldfinger at a country club and joins him in a game. The two play to the 17th hole and, when Goldfinger suggests that Bond did not merely want to meet to play golf. Bond offers the Nazi gold bar to Goldfinger as a prize for winning the game. While playing the next hole, Bond discovers that, like cards, Goldfinger cheats at golf as well, finding a loose ball in the rough, planted there by Goldfinger's caddy, Oddjob, a large Korean man in a suit and bowler hat. On the next green, Bond switches Goldfinger's ball for the one he found. They play to the last green and Goldfinger seemingly wins the match until Bond points out that he played the wrong ball. As a result, Goldfinger loses the match and any chance of obtaining the gold bar Bond had offered. While his car is being packed up by Oddjob, Bond plants the larger tracker in the car and settles up with Goldfinger for his winnings. Goldfinger warns Bond to stay out of his affairs and orders Oddjob to demonstrate his favorite weapon, his blade-rimmed bowler hat, which he uses to decapitate a nearby marble statue. Goldfinger leaves for the airport, having his car loaded into a cargo plane and boarding it himself for Geneva, Switzerland.Bond follows Goldfinger to Geneva, and while observing him from a mountain switchback above, is nearly hit by a shot from a nearby assassin. Bond pursues the assassin, forcing her off the road with the tire slashers mounted on his car. Not realizing that Bond caused the damage to her car, the driver asks Bond to drive her to the nearest auto garage. Bond notices that she's carrying a wooden case with the initials TM. She tells him they are a set of ice skates. Bond leaves her at the garage and continues his tracking of Goldfinger. He arrives at an industrial plant owned by Goldfinger. Hiding in the forested hills above the plant, he infiltrates the facility at night and overhears an conversation between Goldfinger and a Chinese associate where Goldfinger explains his gold smuggling operation: specific parts of his Roll Royce are solid 18 karat gold, which are smelted at the plant. Bond also hears Goldfinger mention something called ""Operation Grand Slam."" As he leaves the grounds, he sees someone nearby wielding a rifle. He wrestles with the person, discovering it is the woman who seemingly attempted to assassinate Bond earlier. It turns out she is Jill Masterson's sister, Tilly, who wants to kill Goldfinger and had tried unsuccessfully earlier on the mountain road, the same shot that nearly hit Bond. During their struggle, Tilly sets off a tripwire, summoning Goldfinger's security guards to their location. Bond is able to dispatch several guards with his cars weapons system, however, he is captured and Tilly is killed by Oddjob.Bond awakes in Goldfinger's laboratory, strapped to a table. Goldfinger has his operatives activate a giant laser which threatens to cut Bond in half from his crotch upwards. Bond tries to inform Goldfinger that he has full details of his plans and that he'll be replaced by another 00 agent if he dies. Goldfinger, however, does not plan to torture Bond for information, just to kill him. Bond plays his last card, saying that he knows of Operation Grand Slam, as does 008. Goldfinger realizes that he should keep Bond alive so word of his plan doesn't leak.Bond is flown from Geneva to Goldfinger's stud farm near Fort Knox, Kentucky. On the plane, he meets Goldfinger's personal pilot, Pussy Galore, whom makes a point of informing Bond that she is a lesbian and ""immune"" to his charms. When they land, a small squadron of planes lands; they are all female pilots trained by Galore herself. At Goldfinger's ranch, Goldfinger meets with several organized crime associates, telling them of his plan; he will rob the gold depositories at Fort Knox. The gangsters, who had helped Goldfinger smuggle the equipment and personnel needed for the operation into the United States, scoff at his plan, saying the area is too heavily fortified by the United States military. Goldfinger explains to them that his plan will involve using a nerve gas, Delta 9, to pacify the troops stationed nearby. The remainder of Ft. Knox' defenses will then be systematically defeated. Bond, escaping from his holding cell, writes a note describing the operation, while standing underneath one of the models used by Goldfinger in his presentation. He is discovered by Pussy Galore, who takes him to Goldfinger. As they leave the area underneath the model, one of Goldfinger's men releases Delta 9 into the room with the gangsters, killing them all.Outside, one of the gangsters, Mr Solo, is preparing to leave with his fee, $1 million in pure gold, deeming Goldfinger's plan too audacious. As he leaves, Bond slips the note and his smaller tracking device into Solo's pocket. Solo is driven to the airport by Oddjob. On the way, Oddjob deliberately passes the airport exit and turns off on a side road. He kills Solo and drives the car to a nearby auto wrecking yard where it is compacted with Solo's body. Oddjob returns to Goldfinger's ranch with the compacted car where Goldfinger comments, to Bond's dismay, that he needs to retrieve his gold from it.Bond meets again with Goldfinger and begins to discuss Grand Slam, citing the fact that removing $15 billion in bullion from Fort Knox would be logistically impossible, taking several days. The plan would fail quickly considering that the United States armed forces would realize what happened and move in to stop the robbery in a few hours. Goldfinger counters by saying he has no plans to actually steal the gold from the depository; he will detonate a small nuclear bomb inside the vault area. Bond surmises that the entire gold supply of the United States will become radioactive for decades and therefore useless. Bond also predicts that the resulting financial meltdown of the United States economy will force other nations to buy gold from Goldfinger himself, substantially increasing the worth of the tycoon's own gold in his possession by at least ten fold. Furthermore, Goldfinger threatens to detonate the bomb in some random city in retaliation should his plan be thwarted. Pussy Galore meets Bond and takes him on an impromptu tour of the ranch. In a nearby barn, the two match judo moves on each other until Bond is able to gain the upper hand and seduce Pussy.The next morning, Galore's flight squadron sprays the Delta 9 gas over the area surrounding Ft. Knox, pacifying all the troops and population of the area. Goldfinger's ground force, including Bond and Oddjob, move in and easily penetrate the immediate defenses of the fort and move into the vault area. The bomb arrives on a helicopter and is moved into the vault, where Bond is handcuffed to it. However, the gas sprayed by Galore's pilots was a ruse; during their tryst, Bond had somehow been able to convince Pussy to switch the canisters for something harmless. The armed forces of the area, satisfied that they can now prevent the enemy from escaping with their nuclear bomb, move in and surround Goldfinger and his crew, starting a furious battle. Goldfinger closes the vault door, trapping Bond, Oddjob and one of his henchmen inside. Bond manages to retrieve the key for his cuffs from the man after Oddjob kills him and battles with Oddjob directly. Bond is little match for Oddjob himself, but is able to retrieve Oddjob's deadly hat. Throwing it at Oddjob, he misses and it becomes embedded in a nearby set of bars. As Oddjob grabs it to take it out, Bond touches the bars with a severed electrical cable, electrocuting Oddjob, who falls dead. Outside, Goldfinger escapes by killing several guards in the guise of a US Army Colonel and flies off in Galore's helicopter.Bond races to the bomb, trying desperately to disarm it. The US army enters the vault, lead by Leiter. One of the men with Leiter shuts the bomb off easily; the timer on the bomb clearly reads 007. Bond is scheduled to fly to the White House for a personal meeting with the President. While on the private jet to Washington, Goldfinger emerges, pointing a (golden) pistol at Bond. He tells Bond that he intends to kill the agent and fly the plane to Cuba. Bond asks where Pussy is, distracting Goldfinger, and attacking him to seize the gun. As they struggle, the gun goes off, blowing out a window, causing the plane to depressurize. Goldfinger is sucked outside and the plane plummets. Watching on a radar screen, Felix and the Air Force see a blip coming off the plane's radar signature. A search party is sent out, one that fails to notice a parachute nearby. Pussy begins waving to the helicopter but Bond grabs her, covering them with the parachute, cheekily saying they don't need to be rescued at that moment.","
    
                    Bond is back and his next mission takes him to Fort Knox, where Auric Goldfinger and his henchman are planning to raid Fort Knox and obliterate the world economy. To save the world once again, Bond will need to become friends with Goldfinger, dodge killer hats and avoid Goldfinger's personal pilot, the sexy Pussy Galore. She might not have feelings for Bond, but will 007 help her change her mind?

Goldfinger, however, does not plan to torture Bond for information, just to kill him. Bond plays his last card, saying that he knows of Operation Grand Slam, as does 008. Goldfinger realizes that he should keep Bond alive so word of his plan doesn't leak.Bond is flown from Geneva to Goldfinger's stud farm near Fort Knox, Kentucky. On the plane, he meets Goldfinger's personal pilot, Pussy Galore, whom makes a point of informing Bond that she is a lesbian and ""immune"" to his charms. When they land, a small squadron of planes lands; they are all female pilots trained by Galore herself. At Goldfinger's ranch, Goldfinger meets with several organized crime associates, telling them of his plan; he will rob the gold depositories at Fort Knox. The gangsters, who had helped Goldfinger smuggle the equipment and personnel needed for the operation into the United States, scoff at his plan, saying the area is too heavily fortified by the United States military. Goldfinger explains to them that his plan will involve using a nerve gas, Delta 9, to pacify the troops stationed nearby. The remainder of Ft. Knox' defenses will then be systematically defeated. Bond, escaping from his holding cell, writes a note describing the operation, while standing underneath one of the models used by Goldfinger in his presentation. He is discovered by Pussy Galore, who takes him to Goldfinger. As they leave the area underneath the model, one of Goldfinger's men releases Delta 9 into the room with the gangsters, killing them all.Outside, one of the gangsters, Mr Solo, is preparing to leave with his fee, $1 million in pure gold, deeming Goldfinger's plan too audacious. As he leaves, Bond slips the note and his smaller tracking device into Solo's pocket. Solo is driven to the airport by Oddjob. On the way, Oddjob deliberately passes the airport exit and turns off on a side road. He kills Solo and drives the car to a nearby auto wrecking yard where it is compacted with Solo's body. Oddjob returns to Goldfinger's ranch with the compacted car where Goldfinger comments, to Bond's dismay, that he needs to retrieve his gold from it.Bond meets again with Goldfinger and begins to discuss Grand Slam, citing the fact that removing $15 billion in bullion from Fort Knox would be logistically impossible, taking several days. The plan would fail quickly considering that the United States armed forces would realize what happened and move in to stop the robbery in a few hours. Goldfinger counters by saying he has no plans to actually steal the gold from the depository; he will detonate a small nuclear bomb inside the vault area. Bond surmises that the entire gold supply of the United States will become radioactive for decades and therefore useless. Bond also predicts that the resulting financial meltdown of the United States economy will force other nations to buy gold from Goldfinger himself, substantially increasing the worth of the tycoon's own gold in his possession by at least ten fold. Furthermore, Goldfinger threatens to detonate the bomb in some random city in retaliation should his plan be thwarted. Pussy Galore meets Bond and takes him on an impromptu tour of the ranch. In a nearby barn, the two match judo moves on each other until Bond is able to gain the upper hand and seduce Pussy.The next morning, Galore's flight squadron sprays the Delta 9 gas over the area surrounding Ft. Knox, pacifying all the troops and population of the area. Goldfinger's ground force, including Bond and Oddjob, move in and easily penetrate the immediate defenses of the fort and move into the vault area. The bomb arrives on a helicopter and is moved into the vault, where Bond is handcuffed to it. However, the gas sprayed by Galore's pilots was a ruse; during their tryst, Bond had somehow been able to convince Pussy to switch the canisters for something harmless. The armed forces of the area, satisfied that they can now prevent the enemy from escaping with their nuclear bomb, move in and surround Goldfinger and his crew, starting a furious battle. Goldfinger closes the vault door, trapping Bond, Oddjob and one of his henchmen inside. Bond manages to retrieve the key for his cuffs from the man after Oddjob kills him and battles with Oddjob directly. Bond is little match for Oddjob himself, but is able to retrieve Oddjob's deadly hat. Throwing it at Oddjob, he misses and it becomes embedded in a nearby set of bars. As Oddjob grabs it to take it out, Bond touches the bars with a severed electrical cable, electrocuting Oddjob, who falls dead. Outside, Goldfinger escapes by killing several guards in the guise of a US Army Colonel and flies off in Galore's helicopter.Bond races to the bomb, trying desperately to disarm it. The US army enters the vault, lead by Leiter. One of the men with Leiter shuts the bomb off easily; the timer on the bomb clearly reads 007. Bond is scheduled to fly to the White House for a personal meeting with the President. While on the private jet to Washington, Goldfinger emerges, pointing a (golden) pistol at Bond. He tells Bond that he intends to kill the agent and fly the plane to Cuba. Bond asks where Pussy is, distracting Goldfinger, and attacking him to seize the gun. As they struggle, the gun goes off, blowing out a window, causing the plane to depressurize. Goldfinger is sucked outside and the plane plummets. Watching on a radar screen, Felix and the Air Force see a blip coming off the plane's radar signature. A search party is sent out, one that fails to notice a parachute nearby. Pussy begins waving to the helicopter but Bond grabs her, covering them with the parachute, cheekily saying they don't need to be rescued at that moment.

When she requests not a doctor but a priest at this time, fifty year old multiple business owner Domenico Soriano - Dummi' in more familiar settings - who is looking over her, reflects on the twenty-two years they have known each other. Their initial meeting was during the war in a house of ill repute, she a naive and illiterate seventeen year old fresh from the country working there, he a customer, although not hers. It wouldn't be until two years later that they would run into each other again and begin this off and on relationship, in which he would always have the upper hand, manipulating her and the situation to his benefit which he knew he could do because of his relative economic standing compared to hers, and the fact that he knew that she has always been in love with him. The nature of their relationship was also as it was due to his frequent absences for work, often months at a time. This situation allowed him to have other women in his life at the same time. The story then shifts to an aspect of Filumena's life of which Dummi' has been unaware, namely her long term relationships with three men he doesn't know or know of: Umberto, a student, Riccardo, a glove salesman, and Michele, a mechanic, the three who in turn don't know each other. When Dummi' finds out about the existence of the three, he has to decide how it will affect his life and his thoughts of Filumena.

                    Aged, wealthy Charlotte Hollis has lived as a recluse in the crumbling family plantation mansion in Hollisport, Louisiana since her father Sam Hollis' death thirty-six years ago. The only people who regularly see her are her hard-as-nails but seemingly loyal housekeeper, Velma Crowther, and her longtime friend and physician, Dr. Drew Bayliss. She has lived there most of her life except for a short stint in London thirty-seven years ago following the vicious murder of her married lover, John Mayhew, at the plantation's summer house while Sam was hosting one of his legendary grand balls in the mansion. She and John had planned to run off together that night, but instead he was bludgeoned to death, his head and right hand severed from his body. Nobody was ever convicted for his murder, but most people believe Charlotte did it after John changed his mind about running off with her. They also believe that Charlotte, whom they haven't seen in years, is a crazy old woman. Conversely, Charlotte has hidden away fearing that people would always be glaring at her. She believes that any bad thing that has happened to her since John's murder has been initiated by his widow, Jewel Mayhew, whom she blames for orchestrating the expropriation of her property to build a bridge across the lake. Charlotte is surprised that her younger cousin Miriam Deering, who left the area years ago and was once Drew's romantic interest, has accepted her invitation to stay at the mansion. While Charlotte wanted Miriam to help her overturn the expropriation with the state government in Baton Rouge, Miriam has actually come to help her pack her belongings. Her visit coincides with the arrival to Hollisport of insurance investigator Harry Willis, who has always wondered why the insurance was never claimed. Not expecting to find anything serious, he tells only Sheriff Luke Standish the true nature of his visit. By this time, Charlotte's mental state seemingly hits a sharp decline, perhaps because she would be leaving her family home, but could it be issues surrounding John's murder? Or is someone trying to drive her crazy if she isn't already? If the latter, the truth of who killed John and why may finally come to light to those who matter.

Although her guilt was never proven, the townspeople liken her to Lizzie Borden; the children even taunt her with cruel rhymes. This is why she lives secluded from society, her needs cared for by her faithful servant Velma. Now, progress in the guise of new highway construction threatens the Hollis plantation, Charlotte's family's domicile since Civil War times. She refuses to leave when the Sheriff issues her an eviction notice, even taking potshots at the highwaymen when they encroach upon her property line. Charlotte summons ""Cousin Miriam"" to fight the public battle to save her home, but Miriam has come to help her pack up, not to save her mansion from the bulldozers. After Charlotte, Miriam is the sole heir to the Hollis estate--motive enough for her to have Charlotte committed for her reclusive, strange behavior. But is Charlotte insane? Doctor Drew seems to feel that she needs help to cross the threshold of insanity.

Witt and his daughter flee from the Zulu village to warn the British soldiers at their mission at Rorke's Drift about an impending Zulu attack.A company of the British Army's 24th Regiment of Foot, a Welsh regiment, is using the missionary station of Rorke's Drift in Natal as a supply depot and hospital for their invasion force across the border in Zululand. Upon receiving news of Isandhlwana from the Witts and that a large enemy force is advancing their way, Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker) of the Royal Engineers assumes command of the small 135-man British detachment, being senior by virtue of his commission date to Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine), who, as an infantry officer, is rather put out to find himself subordinate to an engineer. Realising that they cannot outrun the Zulu army, especially with wounded soldiers, Chard decides to fortify the station and make a stand, using wagons, sacks of mealie, and crates of ship's biscuit. When Witt becomes drunk and starts demoralising the men with his dire predictions, causing the soldiers of the Natal Native Contingent to desert, Chard orders him and his daughter to leave. A group of Zulu warriors, on the hills around the fort, see them but recognizing them as missionaries, allow Witt and his daughter to pass by them.As the Zulu impis approach, a contingent of Boer horsemen arrives. They advise Chard that defending the station is hopeless before they flee, despite Chard's desperate pleas for them to stay. Minutes later, a low rumbling is heard which are thousands of Zulu warriors banging their spears against their cow-hide sheilds which according to Bromhead ""it sounds like a train"". The 4,000-strong Zulu impis appears on a ridge overlooking Rorke's Drift and advances to attack.After an inital assault, hundreds of Zulu riflemen open fire on the station from a neighbouring hill. Over the next few hours, wave after wave of Zulu attackers are repelled. The Zulus do succeed in setting fire to the hospital, leading to intense hand-to-hand fighting between British patients and Zulu warriors as the former try to escape the flames. Malingering Private Henry Hook (James Booth) surprises everyone by taking charge in the successful breakout. Attacks continue into the night.The next morning, at dawn, the Zulus approach to within several hundred yards and begin singing a war chant; the British respond by singing ""Men of Harlech"". In the last assault, just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the tired defenders, the British soldiers fall back to a tiny redoubt that Chard had earlier ordered constructed out of mealie bags. With a reserve of soldiers hidden within the redoubt, they form into three ranks, and pour volley after volley into the stunned natives, who withdraw after sustaining heavy casualties. Later, the Zulus sing a song to honour the bravery of the defenders and leave.The film ends with a narration by Richard Burton, listing the defenders who received the Victoria Cross, including Private Hook. Eleven were awarded for the actual fighting at Rorke's Drift.","

A group of Zulu warriors, on the hills around the fort, see them but recognizing them as missionaries, allow Witt and his daughter to pass by them.As the Zulu impis approach, a contingent of Boer horsemen arrives. They advise Chard that defending the station is hopeless before they flee, despite Chard's desperate pleas for them to stay. Minutes later, a low rumbling is heard which are thousands of Zulu warriors banging their spears against their cow-hide sheilds which according to Bromhead ""it sounds like a train"". The 4,000-strong Zulu impis appears on a ridge overlooking Rorke's Drift and advances to attack.After an inital assault, hundreds of Zulu riflemen open fire on the station from a neighbouring hill. Over the next few hours, wave after wave of Zulu attackers are repelled. The Zulus do succeed in setting fire to the hospital, leading to intense hand-to-hand fighting between British patients and Zulu warriors as the former try to escape the flames. Malingering Private Henry Hook (James Booth) surprises everyone by taking charge in the successful breakout. Attacks continue into the night.The next morning, at dawn, the Zulus approach to within several hundred yards and begin singing a war chant; the British respond by singing ""Men of Harlech"". In the last assault, just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the tired defenders, the British soldiers fall back to a tiny redoubt that Chard had earlier ordered constructed out of mealie bags. With a reserve of soldiers hidden within the redoubt, they form into three ranks, and pour volley after volley into the stunned natives, who withdraw after sustaining heavy casualties. Later, the Zulus sing a song to honour the bravery of the defenders and leave.The film ends with a narration by Richard Burton, listing the defenders who received the Victoria Cross, including Private Hook. Eleven were awarded for the actual fighting at Rorke's Drift.

                    In her own words, the beautiful Marnie Edgar is a cheat, a liar and a thief. Her M.O.: using one of a number of aliases each with a distinct social security number and a different look (generally entailing a different hair color and style), she gets an accounting type job at an office which will allow her access to the office safe, steals the money in the safe, then disappears without a trace. Much of that money goes to her Baltimore port area residing mother, Bernice Edgar, who doesn't ask from where the money comes and who seems to have an uneasy relationship with her daughter. The latest scam on which Marnie embarks, using the alias Mary Taylor, a widow, is at Philadelphia based Rutland & Co. What Marnie is unaware of is that company president Mark Rutland, a recent widower, who saw Marnie when she came in for her interview, suggested that she be hired despite she not being the most qualified candidate, solely because he recognized her as the beautiful Marion Holland, the former clerk at Strutt & Co. - a client of Rutland - who was hired there solely for her good looks, and who reportedly stole $10,000 from its office safe. Marnie does not recognize Mark. Mark wants to find out her story. He begins to do so after she manages to steal money out of the Rutland office safe. Mark did some research on her and she, who is between a rock and a hard place concerning this most recent theft, eventually fills in the rest of the details concerning her criminal activities. However, Mark doesn't send her to prison, but rather has a proposition for her which she can't refuse. This agreement with Mark ends up being her own kind of prison, from which she tries to escape. While Mark tries to understand why Marnie is the way that she is, which includes seemingly morbid fears of thunderstorms, saturated instances of the color red, and being touched by men, Mark's sister-in-law, Lil Mainwaring, who seems to have aspirations to be the next Mrs. Mark Rutland, tries to find out what Marnie and Mark are hiding. If Lil is successful, Marnie's past could catch up with her and Mark and their arrangement.

"13","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058092/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","It's 1942, and the war in the Pacific is not going well for the Allies. At the moment, the Australians are evacuating the island of Salamaua, taking what they can and destroying the rest. In all the confusion, scruffy beachcomber Walter Eckland (Cary Grant) arrives, ties his launch to the pier and begins helping himself to cans of His Majesty's Royal Navy petrol.A young officer, Stebbings (Jack Good), spots him and indignantly asks what he's doing. Walter pauses long enough to look at Stebbings, and say, incredulously, ""Do you know who I am?"" Taken aback, Stebbings admits, ""Well, no, I don't."" ""Well...we'll let it go this time,"" says Walter, magnanimously, and resumes stacking cans by his boat.In the harbormaster's office, Commander Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard) is talking on the radio to the admiral, reassuring him that everything will go as planned. Stebbings bursts in, and tries to ask Frank if he knows the cheeky Yank at the far end of the pier. Frank motions him to hush, then tells the admiral that yes, all the coast watcher positions have been assigned...all except for Matalava. But at that moment, Frank catches sight of Walter and his face brightens. He tells the admiral he has found his man for Matalava. As they walk down the pier, Frank tells Stebbings that Walter is a hard-drinking drop-out from civilization, but he knows the islands like the back of his hand and is as sharp as they come.Frank and Walter greet each other in a way that suggests they share a certain amount of history. Frank explains the coast watching service to Walter, and asks him to go Matalava, just for a while...until they can find someone permanent. Walter cheerfully refuses. Frank immediately turns to Stebbings and orders him to confiscate all the small boats on the pier (although Walter's is obviously the only one). At first Walter protests, but he soon realizes Frank will indeed follow through on the order, so he cheerfully agrees to go to Matalava. Frank is not fooled. In the next scene, Walter arrives at Matalava...escorted by a Class B RAN motor launch, with Frank and Stebbings overseeing Walter's progress from the bridge. As sailors transport Walter's supplies to the island, Stebbings asks Frank what's to prevent Walter from sailing out again the moment they leave. Frank chides Stebbings for having so little faith in his fellow man...and orders him to get underway by turning hard a-port. Stebbings starts to obey, then stops, uncertain...he asks Frank to confirm the order, then he nods happily, and orders the coxswain to turn hard a-port. As the launch turns, it tears a big, ragged hole in Walter's hull just above the waterline.Using his dinghy (which is equipped with a small outboard motor), Walter tows the launch to a tiny, sheltered lagoon, and makes his way to a little grass hut just off the beach. The supplies have been left here; there's a cot, table and chairs, radio, and charts of Japanese planes and ships on the walls. Frank calls up on the radio to give Walter further instruction on his duties, and on the use of code names when talking on the radio. Frank is Big Bad Wolf, Stebbings is Little Bo Peep...and Walter is to be Mother Goose. Frank hastily switches off the radio on Walter's angry, profane response.""I don't see we've accomplished anything,"" says Stebbings. ""After all you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."" ""Oh, if he gets thirsty enough, Stebbings, he'll drink,"" replies Frank, dryly. And sure enough, a moment later Walter calls to ask about the case of whiskey that was delivered with the supplies. Frank tells Walter his men have hidden the bottles in spots he will never find on his own. Whenever Walter calls to report any Japanese planes or ships he's seen, he'll be given directions on where to find one bottle. Walter immediately tells Frank that he's seen a couple of Japanese planes, and starts giving him a detailed description. ""CONFIRMED sightings, Walter,"" says Frank, interrupting Walter's attempted ruse.Walter resigns himself to an indefinite stay on Matalava...at least until he can repair his boat. He works on it whenever possible...and diligently reports any Japanese plane and ship movements...and loses no time applying for the promised bottle afterward.Stebbings informs Frank that another of the coast watchers, Perry on Bundy Island, is ringed in by the Japanese and requesting to be withdrawn. A quick look at their map shows that Walter is the only one near enough to help. Frank calls Walter and offers him a bargain: if he'll go to Bundy, and pick up Perry, Perry will help him fix his boat and stay on at Matalava in his place. Walter refuses at first, shrewdly guessing Frank hasn't told him everything. Then he calls Frank back and makes a counter offer: after all, a man in a seven-foot dinghy traveling over all those miles of open sea would need a little comfort...after a failed attempt at bartering, Frank agrees to provide directions to all the remaining bottles of whiskey.Walter lands at the south jetty on Bundy after dark, as instructed...but Perry isn't waiting there for him, as promised. He cautiously makes his way to Perry's shack...and stumbles just outside over what looks like a grave, marked with a rough cross. He goes inside and sees that the hut has been strafed from the air...everything has been shot to pieces.He hears a faint noise, turns, and sees a shadow behind the window blind. He creeps over, pulls it up suddenly, and finds himself pointing his gun at a lovely young Frenchwoman (Leslie Caron)--who is pointing a gun right back at him. He asks her about Perry, and she answers if that's the man who lived here, she found him dead and buried him. A Japanese patrol boat passes...they duck...the light sweeps over them, but they are not seen. Walter tells her they should get out of there, and she motions to someone out of sight, and whispers, ""Come on, we're leaving."" Walter watches dumbfounded as seven little schoolgirls, each in a neat uniform and hat, and carrying a suitcase, file past the window and follow the woman down to the jetty. Walter protests that his little dinghy won't hold all of them. ""All right,"" says the woman, ""Tell me which of them you want to leave behind?"" Realizing he's beaten, he helps them all into the dinghy. But he throws away all their luggage, growling ""This isn't the Queen Mary,"" when they protest.The trip back is harrowing...the dinghy rides very low in the water. At one point, two Japanese destroyers pass on either side of them in the dark, and the little craft is almost swamped in their wake: all must bail to keep it afloat. When they arrive at Matalava, Walter angrily jumps off the boat and storms up to the hut, leaving the girls to make their own way. He calls Frank on the radio and accuses him of tricking him into picking up the girls. But Frank is as puzzled by their presence as Walter, and the woman takes the radio mike to explain. She is Catherine Freneau, daughter of the French Consul at Rabaul...the girls are the daughters of other diplomats. They were being evacuated to Australia when their pilot got a distress call from a downed bomber. He dropped them off at Bundy, promising to return for them...but then the Japanese landed on the island.Frank asks them to stand by while they figure something out. Walter opens a bottle of whiskey, and drinks...opens a can of food, and begins to eat out of the can as the girls look on. Catherine points out that they could all do with some food. He tosses a can to her, and goes on eating. She sighs, and begins to order the girls to straighten up the hut, clean off the table, open some tins...she asks Walter where he keeps his tea things. ""Tea things,"" he mutters, "". He watches warily, but only intervenes when one of the girls starts to move his hard-won whiskey.Frank comes back on the radio to inform them that he can't take the girls off Matalava...they may have to stay there for several weeks. He will arrange a parachute drop in a couple of days, to deliver additional supplies. Walter is outraged. He wants them off his island, immediately...especially Catherine, whom he calls ""Miss Goody Two-Shoes."" For her part, Catherine tells Frank that Walter is ""a rude, foul-mouthed, filthy beast."" But there's nothing to be done, they're all stuck with each other.Catherine sends the girls outside, and tries to convince Walter that they must work together, and their main concern must be the children: He must let them have the hut, and help her keep them safe and secure; above all, he must stop swearing and drinking in front of them...after all, he is the ""Father"" figure. Walter retorts that he has no intention of being a ""Father"" figure...all he intends to be is a ""Total Stranger"" figure. He tells her to get out and let him get some sleep. He defiantly takes off his pants in front of her, and lies down on the cot. She leaves...but a few moments later her little guerilla fighters attack the hut with sticks and coconuts. Walter comes outside with a blanket wrapped around his waist, pants over his arm, and a bottle in his hand...""Lady,"" he says to her threateningly, ""you're making a powerful enemy."" But it's an empty threat, and they all know it. He retreats to his boat, where he will stay for the duration.Later, one of the girls comes down to the boat to fetch him: Frank is on the radio. Walter hurries off to the shack...not noticing the girl stays behind, and beckons to the others, who have hidden in the trees nearby.Walter finds Catherine alone in the shack, mending a piece of clothing. He looks around nonchalantly for the whiskey...""I asked you to stop drinking in front of the girls,"" she says, primly, ""but you wouldn't."" She has hidden it all away again, to Walter's supreme frustration!Frank is no longer on the radio, but he left a message, and after some suspicious fumbling and stalling, Catherine finally produces it. Frank has been unable to arrange a parachute drop...they'll have to make do with what they have. Catherine asks Walter if he would consider sharing some of his personal belongings with her and the girls. He tells her he'd trade for his whiskey. She declines, and he leaves.As he starts back down to the boat, the girls run past him one by one, each concealing a bundle of clothing, tools, blankets, which they've taken from his boat. As the last little girl runs by, Walter finally gets wise...he tries to stop her, and she hits him on the toe with the hammer she's stealing. By the time he recovers, all the girls are inside the hut with Catherine standing guard. Out-maneuvered again, he retreats to his empty, empty boat.He keeps a watch on the hut, and on Catherine and the girls, now wearing bits, pieces and weirdly-altered versions of his clothes. There's Elizabeth (Stephanie Berrington), 14, pretty, but shy and bespectacled; Anne (Pip Sparke), 12, sullen and aloof, whose answer to every question is, ""I want to go home""; Harriet (Jennifer Berrington), ten, a cheerful tomboy who prefers to be called Harry; the French twins, Angelique and Dominique (Laurelle and Nicole Felsette), nine, who speak only French, but may understand more than they let on; Christine (Verina Greenlaw), about eight, a no-nonsense little Brit, with an invisible friend, Gretchen; Jenny (Sharyl Locke), also British, around six or seven, very quiet and sad. He waits for his chance: he'll give up the hut, and they can have the clothes...but he wants that whiskey!One day he spots a Japanese destroyer in the bay, and an inflatable raft with four armed Japanese sailors coming ashore. He runs up to the shack and finds only Catherine and Christine there. The rest are on the beach gathering coconuts. He and Catherine run down quickly to find them. They find four of them coming back from the beach, their arms full of coconuts, and send them back to the shack to hide. They continue to the beach, where they find Anne perched precariously, but more or less hidden, high up in a palm, near where the sailors are landing. Jenny is nowhere to be seen. Walter motions to Anne to stay where she is, and he and Catherine crouch down behind a couple of fallen logs. The sailors set off down the beach, away from them...just as Jenny appears, oblivious to what's going on, to add two more coconuts to the pile under the palm. Walter whispers to Catherine that if Jenny makes a sound they're done...Catherine murmurs that Jenny hasn't spoken since she left her parents. ""She can still scream, can't she?"" says Walter grimly, and runs swiftly to Jenny while the sailors' backs are turned. He puts his hand over her mouth to silence any outcry (managing not to cry out himself, when Jenny give him a good, hard bite), and hides her until the sailors are out of sight. Then he brings her back, frightened and crying, to Catherine, who comforts and quiets her.It turns out that Catherine understands Japanese, and she tells Walter that they are trying to find turtles for soup. Unable to find any, the Japanese return to the dinghy, and shove off. They don't leave a moment too soon: Anne is slipping from her perch. Walter manages to get under her, and, quietly but painfully, break her fall. When the sailors are back on board, and the ship is out of sight, they all leave the beach. No one notices that the bright red bandana Anne was wearing (one of Walter's) has snagged in the fronds of the palm.Walter is working on his boat when Jenny suddenly appears, staring silently over the railing at him. He looks back at her for a moment, surprised, then tells her to beat it. She produces a bottle of whiskey, and sets it on the railing near him. Dumbfounded, he looks at it, then at her...and says, ""Thank you"", in a slightly hoarse voice. He removes the cap, takes a healthy swig, and thanks her again. He asks her name--she doesn't answer. He produces a small silver whistle on a chain, and asks if she'd like to have it. She nods. ""All you have to do is repeat three words after me."" She nods again. ""Elephant,"" he says. After a pause, she repeats, ""Elephant."" ""Rhinoceros,"" says Walter. ""Rhinoceros,"" she repeats. ""Wrong!"" says Walter. ""Why?"" she demands, indignantly. ""No, not 'Why'..,"" says Walter, "" 'Wrong!' That was the third word--you lose."" He puts the whistle back in his pocket...and Jenny snatches back the whiskey. Muttering about poor losers, Walter hands her the whistle, and she returns the whiskey. He takes another swig, and when he looks again, Harry is standing next to Jenny, smiling happily. They offer to help him fix his boat, and he tells them they can swab down the deck. Soon all the girls are there, working on the boat in one capacity or another.Catherine arrives, looking for the girls, and she's astonished to find them here. She orders them back to the shack for lessons, but Jenny protests that they'd rather stay and help Mr. Eckland. Catherine stares at Jenny in surprise, and Elizabeth brightly explains that Mr. Eckland got her to talk. ""Better do as she says,"" Walter tells the girls, and reluctantly they head back to the shack. A little jealous, Catherine says tartly that next time she needs the girls to do anything, she'll just call on him. ""It's not my fault that boats are more fun than lessons,"" he replies, mildly. As he's talking, he wades out into the lagoon a little way. He crouches, and after a moment plunges his hands into the water and skillfully flips a fish onto the shore. ""Why don't you teach them something useful, like that?"" he says. Catherine tries it, but fails miserably. Walter approaches to show her how it's done...but standing so close to her, he suddenly realizes that he's very...attracted to her. Startled, he backs away. Confused, Catherine asks, ""Mr. Eckland, are you or aren't you going to teach me to fish?"" After a moment's consideration, he replies ""I aren't"". He wades deeper into the lagoon, and begins to swim away, while she watches, mystified.Catherine and Anne are foraging for berries, near a little pond. Catherine slips off a log, into the water. ""Oh... Something bit me"", she exclaims, and looks at two little holes near her left ankle. ""A snake, a snake!"" cries Anne, pointing to a long, dark shape in the water nearby. Catherine jumps out of the water, and they flee to the hut. After a moment, the dark shape emerges fully from the water: it's only a branch, with thorns and a couple of wilted leaves.Catherine is on the cot surrounded by the girls when Walter comes in, summoned by one of the French twins. Catherine briefly explains what happened; he sends the girls out, and examines the tiny wound gravely. With his knife (sterilized over the stove's flame) he makes a small cut across the marks, and attempts to suck out the venom. Then he calls Frank on the radio: ""What kind of snakes have they got around here?"" he asks. ""Uh, is that a rhetorical question, I hope?"" asks Frank, warily. ""Miss Freneau went and found one,"" replies Walter, evenly. Frank sends Stebbings for a doctor, and tells Walter to stand by. ""And Walter,"" he adds, ""until we know what we're dealing with, don't try to be a movie hero and suck out the venom, ok?"" Walter and Catherine look at each other a little sheepishly.Frank returns shortly, and asks Walter to put on the headphones. The doctor tells him there are three varieties of snakes indigenous to the islands, all extremely poisonous. Nothing can be done for Catherine...the end will come very soon: She'll experience a general feeling of numbness, then dizziness, and then death. The doctor tells Walter to make her comfortable, and recommends the liberal use of any strong, analgesic sedative he may have on hand to do so. ""I don't have anything like that,"" protests Walter, and Frank replies, ""Nonsense, Walter, you've been using one for years.""Walter persuades Catherine to tell him where he can find a bottle of whiskey...best medicine for snakebite, after all. She drains her first coconut cupful quickly...and as he pours another, she tells him she doesn't disapprove of drinking, only excessive drinking. As she's working on her third cupful, she says that after the death of her mother, she served as hostess at all consulate functions. ""We had martinis before dinner, white wine with the fish,"" she says, running through the checklist, ""red wine with the main course, champagne with dessert, cognac with coffee, and port after dinner."" Walter takes a swig of the whiskey and comments enviously, ""Sounds GREAT!""After her fifth drink, Catherine observes that it's getting very hot in the shack...and seems unable to keep from waving her very limber legs in the air and giggling. She asks Walter what her blood tasted like. After some discussion as to whether or not it was too salty, Walter decides the girls don't need to watch all of this, and closes the blinds and the curtain over the door. They can still listen, though, and while they're doing so, Anne suddenly shouts she's going to kill that rotten snake, and runs off toward the pond.Catherine admits she's obsessively disciplined. ""I'm a picture-straightener,"" she laments. ""Whenever I see a picture hanging crookedly, I straighten it. And I brush my teeth every morning and every night, no matter what."" She tells him that she's lived in 11 countries and speaks seven languages...that she once had a fiance named Cesare...he worked for the Italian Consulate, and whenever he kissed her, he would first ask ""Permesso"", and afterward he would say ""Grazie."" She giggles wildly, and tells Walter that Cesare would never have done to her leg what he did. She tells him earnestly that she liked what he did to her leg.Then she asks Walter what ""she"" was like. ""What 'who' was like?"" asks Walter. ""The woman who drove you to this,"" she says, gesturing all around her, to the shack, the island...to his solitary life. ""It was no woman,"" he replies, ""it was a necktie."" Believing that she will not live to pass the story on, he tells her that eight years ago, he'd been a professor of history at an American university. One morning, in a rush, he'd gone to class without his necktie...and they'd refused to let him in. He'd thought they'd care more about the content of his brain than what he wore around his neck, but he'd looked at them, then, and realized they all wore neckties. They all looked the same, talked the same, and thought the same, and they weren't learning anything...at least nothing he had to teach...and they were perpetuating the same old problems. So he'd packed up and departed for the South Seas the next day.Catherine listens with interest...then giggles to think that he was once a school teacher...then remarks that she's beginning to feel numb. Recognizing this symptom of approaching death, he helps her lie back on the cot. ""Oh, I'm dizzy,"" she murmurs, ""I'm so dizzy!"" She suddenly sits up and exclaims, ""Oh, dear!"" in a surprised little voice...and passes out cold.Walter assumes she is dead. Slowly, gently, he takes the cup of whiskey from her hand, crosses her hands on her breast and pulls the blanket up over her face. Then he drinks the whiskey left in her cup (waste not, want not!)Meanwhile, Anne has returned, carrying the snake-resembling branch in her hand. ""What's that?"" asks Elizabeth. ""It's the snake,"" replies Anne. ""That's not a snake,"" says Jenny. ""It LOOKED like a snake,"" says Anne. ""You ninny!"" declares Christine. ""Oh, la!"" sighs one of the little French twins.Walter calls Frank: ""It's over,"" he says, ""Miss Freneau is...gone."" ""I'm sorry, Walter,"" says Frank. ""Have the girls been told?"" ""No,"" replies Walter, ""Stick around, why don't you...I may need you later.""Walter comes out and sits down on the porch, and the girls gather around him. He tells them gently that Miss Freneau is gone. They tell him earnestly that she's not. Anne produces the stick, and he asks, ""What's that?"" ""It's the snake,"" says Anne. ""Well, that's not a snake,"" he replies. ""It LOOKED like a snake,"" says Anne. She hands it to him, he looks at it, and after a moment, agrees, ""That looks like a snake."" He goes back inside, and pulls the cover back from Catherine's face. Her eyes open, and she looks at him, quizzically....""Is it morning already?"" she asks, and he covers her up again. He goes back to the radio, and calls Frank. Frank has summoned the chaplain to say a few words of comfort. ""Never mind,"" says Walter. ""Miss Freneau's alive. It's the snake that's dead."" Leaving Frank sputtering on the radio, he takes what's left of the bottle of whiskey, and heads back to his boat.He's tinkering with the patch he's rigged for the hull when Catherine, walking gingerly due to a monstrous hangover, comes in to talk to him. She asks him if she said or did anything for which she'd need to apologize. He tells her no...except when she put the flower between her teeth and danced naked around the room. ""I couldn't' have done that!"" she protests, then asks doubtfully, ""Did I?"" He asks her what she does remember. She replies nothing, really, and he relaxes. Or at least, she adds, nothing after his story about the necktie, she adds, and he explodes. He shouts at her that he never wants to hear about that again. She doesn't see why it should bother him so much, she'd thought he was running away from something much worse. He shouts that he wasn't running away, he was escaping...from hypocrits like her who have to get drunk to let themselves go. ""If you'd start letting men wear their own pants, maybe they'd feel they could touch you without asking 'Permesso',"" he shouts. Catherine slaps his face, crisply. He thinks about it...and slaps her back, not hard, but with sincerity. She isn't hurt, physically, but her face crumples into tears, and she runs off the boat. Walter watches her go with the beginnings of shame on his face.Later, as the girls are sitting down to dinner, Walter arrives at the front door. ""Look,"" says Jenny, in wonder, ""he's combed his hair."" ""And he's actually wearing socks,"" says Christine, awed. He apologizes for interrupting, and says he thought that if they had any extra food, he might... Catherine jumps up to prepare a plate for him. She is wearing the suit jacket and skirt she wore when they first met. They look at each other shyly, knowingly, and she sits down and passes the plate she has fixed for him down the table.""I'm tired of tinned beef,"" says Anne. ""Why can't we ever have fish?"" ""Professor Eckland was giving me fishing lessons,"" says Catherine, demurely...""but he never finishes what he starts!"" Walter chokes on the bite of food he's just swallowed...the nearest girls all begin to pound on his back, while the others shout advice. In the midst of the confusion, practical little Jenny brings him a bottle of whiskey. He takes off the cap and prepares to have a swig...but Catherine says, ""Uh-uh-uh, Mr. Eckland,"" and he reluctantly, but respectfully, puts the bottle aside. Shuddering a little, he has a sip of coconut milk instead.Suddenly, they hear a plane...very loud and close. A Japanese pilot has spotted the red bandana in the coconut tree, and is flying by it repeatedly, trying to figure it out. Walter runs out of the shack, and watches the plane from behind a palm tree, as it circles around. When it's gone, he immediately calls Frank. But Frank is unimpressed, convinced this is another ruse on Walter's part to get off the island. Angry, Walter stalks out of the shack, knowing that at some point the plane will come back.Later, Catherine comes down to his boat, to talk to him about the girls. She notices that the hole has been patched and he's working on the engine now. The talk turns to their own situation, and raised voices follow as they try to deny they have feelings for each other. Finally, after Catherine calls Walter a drunken escapist, and he calls her a frustrated old spinster, Catherine slaps Walter's face again...and Walter slaps her right back. But instead of running away this time, Catherine gets a very determined look on her face, and slaps him again. Walter pauses, considering what to do next.Stebbings calls to Frank, and tells him that Walter is requesting a chaplain. ""Good heavens,"" Frank exclaims, ""he's finally killed her!"" ""No,"" declares Stebbings, ""they want to get married!"" ""Married?!?"" says Frank, astounded, ""Goody Two Shoes and The Filthy Beast?!?""A chaplain is summoned, and a sailor with an accordian. Catherine has put her hair up, and all the girls have dressed in their neat school uniforms. Walter has dressed up again, and even fastened his collar button. Harry removes her necktie and offers it to Walter. ""Oh, no thank you, Harry,"" says Catherine, ""neckties don't suit Mr. Eckland,"" signifying that she's ready to accept him ""as is"".Frank says he needs to fill out a little paper work on their behalf...they each tell their full name for the record, and each smiles a little at hearing the other's for the first time. Frank asks the name of the maid of honor, Catherine supplies Elizabeth's name, and Elizabeth looks pleased. Frank asks the name of the best man...Walter looks around at the girls, and finally announces, ""Harry MacGregor."" Harry smiles radiantly.The sailor begins to play ""Oh Promise Me"" on his accordian, and the chaplain begins to read the text. Just as he asks if there are any objections to the marriage, the angry sound of an airplane engine interrupts them. Walter runs to the door, and looks up...the Japanese fighter plane has returned, and is lining up for a strafing run on the shack. They dive for cover just in time, as bullets rip through the shack. The plane turns around for a second run, and they scurry out to hide in the trees. Walter darts back inside, while the plane turns around for a third run...he interrupts the chaplain who is droning on about Walter taking this woman, and asks for Frank. He tells Frank the plane has returned. Frank is still doubtful, but Walter leaves the mike open so Frank can hear the bullets from the plane's last run, and Frank hurries off to make arrangements to get them all off the island.Catherine runs into the shack to make sure Walter's all right, and the chaplain asks if there's anything he can do. The plane has gone, so Walter tells the chaplain to finish the ceremony. Lying under the table in the ruined shack, and using a bandaid for a ring, Walter and Catherine are pronounced man and wife. Frank breaks in at this point, and tells Walter that an American sub is running submerged a few miles away. When they surface at nightfall, he'll get a radio message to them, and they should be able to make Matalava by dawn. He advises them to stay away from the hut, to sleep on the beach and be ready to signal the sub when it arrives.That night, as Walter and Catherine keep watch over the sleeping girls, she whispers to him, ""You'll not be coming with us, will you?"" ""I can't leave the boat,"" he replies. ""It must be a good one,"" she says, wistfully. ""Good or bad, it's all the dowry you're going to get,"" he responds. ""I'm thinking of starting a charter service, after the war...somewhere around the Solomons or maybe the New Hebrides. There'll be good money for anybody with a boat who knows the islands."" Walter, it seems, has plans to rejoin the human race for Catherine's sake.At dawn, they hear the sound of a heavy engine approaching. But as the ship comes into view, they see it's not the promised American submarine, it's a Japanese patrol boat. Walter hurries the girls off the beach, telling Catherine to hide with them at his launch. Trying to distract and delay them, Walter runs up to the shack, and sets it on fire. Two rubber rafts have landed, with a dozen or so armed Japanese sailors. He ducks them as they run toward the shack, and runs down to their rafts on the beach, slashing them with his knife to deflate them.Catherine and the girls are hiding, but come out when he returns to the launch. Catherine points to the transom, where Walter has neatly painted ""Catherine"", with ""Matalava"" underneath, and asks when he did that. ""Last night while you slept,"" he says...and adds in a meaningful tone, ""There wasn't much else to do."" He tells them to get into the dinghy, but to stay hidden in the lagoon. The sub will not surface while the patrol boat is there, but they will be watching, and he will decoy the patrol boat out past the reef where the sub can sink it. As he jumps into the launch, Catherine calls after him to be careful...""I look simply awful in black,"" she says.On the submarine, just outside the bay, the captain and the mate are taking turns watching the hut burn through the periscope. They see Walter's launch dart out of the lagoon, and watch as the patrol boat comes about to pursue it. The patrol boat is firing on and lobbing shells at the launch...some of the shots come perilously close. The captain watches tensely as both boats approach the reef, and as the launch crosses over it, he orders the torpedos readied. Just as the patrol boat clears the reef, one of the Japanese boat's shells hits its mark... and the launch is blown to smithereens. The captain orders the torpedos to be fired, and the patrol boat is itself destroyed. The captain orders the mate to surface and look for survivors...without much hope.Catherine and the girls have piloted the dinghy out into the bay, and they are desperately looking through the wreckage of the launch for Walter. The motor has stalled, and Catherine is frantically trying to get it started again. One of the girls notices Walter's hat floating by, and Catherine sorrowfully reaches out to retrieve it. Suddenly Walter himself swims up to the boat, and they greet him joyously. At the last second, he'd been able to tie off the wheel and jump overboard. ""I'm sorry about our boat,"" Catherine says. ""Well, in a war, everybody loses something,"" he says, philosophically...""I'm just glad it was THAT Catherine."" She leans down to kiss him, and he tells her to wait just a moment, and let him get in the dinghy. He puts a leg up over the side, and the boat rocks ominously. The girls squeal, and Catherine protests that he's going to tip them in. ""No, no, no,"" he says, ""this will work...all of you get over to that side. Look, will you just do it MY way for once?""In the next scene, the little boat is upside down in the water. Walter, Catherine, and all the girls are sitting on top of it, soaking wet. They all look at Walter accusingly. ""Shut up,"" he says, morosely. The sub commander has been watching, and smiles. ""Looks like we're going to be taking on passengers after all,"" he tells the mate. As the sub approaches, Walter muses, ""I wonder if they serve coconut milk on submarines.""","

    Synopsis
    It's 1942, and the war in the Pacific is not going well for the Allies. At the moment, the Australians are evacuating the island of Salamaua, taking what they can and destroying the rest. In all the confusion, scruffy beachcomber Walter Eckland (Cary Grant) arrives, ties his launch to the pier and begins helping himself to cans of His Majesty's Royal Navy petrol.A young officer, Stebbings (Jack Good), spots him and indignantly asks what he's doing. Walter pauses long enough to look at Stebbings, and say, incredulously, ""Do you know who I am?"" Taken aback, Stebbings admits, ""Well, no, I don't."" ""Well...we'll let it go this time,"" says Walter, magnanimously, and resumes stacking cans by his boat.In the harbormaster's office, Commander Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard) is talking on the radio to the admiral, reassuring him that everything will go as planned. Stebbings bursts in, and tries to ask Frank if he knows the cheeky Yank at the far end of the pier. Frank motions him to hush, then tells the admiral that yes, all the coast watcher positions have been assigned...all except for Matalava. But at that moment, Frank catches sight of Walter and his face brightens. He tells the admiral he has found his man for Matalava. As they walk down the pier, Frank tells Stebbings that Walter is a hard-drinking drop-out from civilization, but he knows the islands like the back of his hand and is as sharp as they come.Frank and Walter greet each other in a way that suggests they share a certain amount of history. Frank explains the coast watching service to Walter, and asks him to go Matalava, just for a while...until they can find someone permanent. Walter cheerfully refuses. Frank immediately turns to Stebbings and orders him to confiscate all the small boats on the pier (although Walter's is obviously the only one). At first Walter protests, but he soon realizes Frank will indeed follow through on the order, so he cheerfully agrees to go to Matalava. Frank is not fooled. In the next scene, Walter arrives at Matalava...escorted by a Class B RAN motor launch, with Frank and Stebbings overseeing Walter's progress from the bridge. As sailors transport Walter's supplies to the island, Stebbings asks Frank what's to prevent Walter from sailing out again the moment they leave. Frank chides Stebbings for having so little faith in his fellow man...and orders him to get underway by turning hard a-port. Stebbings starts to obey, then stops, uncertain...he asks Frank to confirm the order, then he nods happily, and orders the coxswain to turn hard a-port. As the launch turns, it tears a big, ragged hole in Walter's hull just above the waterline.Using his dinghy (which is equipped with a small outboard motor), Walter tows the launch to a tiny, sheltered lagoon, and makes his way to a little grass hut just off the beach. The supplies have been left here; there's a cot, table and chairs, radio, and charts of Japanese planes and ships on the walls. Frank calls up on the radio to give Walter further instruction on his duties, and on the use of code names when talking on the radio. Frank is Big Bad Wolf, Stebbings is Little Bo Peep...and Walter is to be Mother Goose. Frank hastily switches off the radio on Walter's angry, profane response.""I don't see we've accomplished anything,"" says Stebbings. ""After all you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."" ""Oh, if he gets thirsty enough, Stebbings, he'll drink,"" replies Frank, dryly. And sure enough, a moment later Walter calls to ask about the case of whiskey that was delivered with the supplies. Frank tells Walter his men have hidden the bottles in spots he will never find on his own. Whenever Walter calls to report any Japanese planes or ships he's seen, he'll be given directions on where to find one bottle. Walter immediately tells Frank that he's seen a couple of Japanese planes, and starts giving him a detailed description. ""CONFIRMED sightings, Walter,"" says Frank, interrupting Walter's attempted ruse.Walter resigns himself to an indefinite stay on Matalava...at least until he can repair his boat. He works on it whenever possible...and diligently reports any Japanese plane and ship movements...and loses no time applying for the promised bottle afterward.Stebbings informs Frank that another of the coast watchers, Perry on Bundy Island, is ringed in by the Japanese and requesting to be withdrawn. A quick look at their map shows that Walter is the only one near enough to help. Frank calls Walter and offers him a bargain: if he'll go to Bundy, and pick up Perry, Perry will help him fix his boat and stay on at Matalava in his place. Walter refuses at first, shrewdly guessing Frank hasn't told him everything. Then he calls Frank back and makes a counter offer: after all, a man in a seven-foot dinghy traveling over all those miles of open sea would need a little comfort...after a failed attempt at bartering, Frank agrees to provide directions to all the remaining bottles of whiskey.Walter lands at the south jetty on Bundy after dark, as instructed...but Perry isn't waiting there for him, as promised. He cautiously makes his way to Perry's shack...and stumbles just outside over what looks like a grave, marked with a rough cross. He goes inside and sees that the hut has been strafed from the air...everything has been shot to pieces.He hears a faint noise, turns, and sees a shadow behind the window blind. He creeps over, pulls it up suddenly, and finds himself pointing his gun at a lovely young Frenchwoman (Leslie Caron)--who is pointing a gun right back at him. He asks her about Perry, and she answers if that's the man who lived here, she found him dead and buried him. A Japanese patrol boat passes...they duck...the light sweeps over them, but they are not seen. Walter tells her they should get out of there, and she motions to someone out of sight, and whispers, ""Come on, we're leaving."" Walter watches dumbfounded as seven little schoolgirls, each in a neat uniform and hat, and carrying a suitcase, file past the window and follow the woman down to the jetty. Walter protests that his little dinghy won't hold all of them. ""All right,"" says the woman, ""Tell me which of them you want to leave behind?"" Realizing he's beaten, he helps them all into the dinghy. But he throws away all their luggage, growling ""This isn't the Queen Mary,"" when they protest.The trip back is harrowing...the dinghy rides very low in the water. At one point, two Japanese destroyers pass on either side of them in the dark, and the little craft is almost swamped in their wake: all must bail to keep it afloat. When they arrive at Matalava, Walter angrily jumps off the boat and storms up to the hut, leaving the girls to make their own way. He calls Frank on the radio and accuses him of tricking him into picking up the girls. But Frank is as puzzled by their presence as Walter, and the woman takes the radio mike to explain. She is Catherine Freneau, daughter of the French Consul at Rabaul...the girls are the daughters of other diplomats. They were being evacuated to Australia when their pilot got a distress call from a downed bomber. He dropped them off at Bundy, promising to return for them...but then the Japanese landed on the island.Frank asks them to stand by while they figure something out. Walter opens a bottle of whiskey, and drinks...opens a can of food, and begins to eat out of the can as the girls look on. Catherine points out that they could all do with some food. He tosses a can to her, and goes on eating. She sighs, and begins to order the girls to straighten up the hut, clean off the table, open some tins...she asks Walter where he keeps his tea things. ""Tea things,"" he mutters, "". He watches warily, but only intervenes when one of the girls starts to move his hard-won whiskey.Frank comes back on the radio to inform them that he can't take the girls off Matalava...they may have to stay there for several weeks. He will arrange a parachute drop in a couple of days, to deliver additional supplies. Walter is outraged. He wants them off his island, immediately...especially Catherine, whom he calls ""Miss Goody Two-Shoes."" For her part, Catherine tells Frank that Walter is ""a rude, foul-mouthed, filthy beast."" But there's nothing to be done, they're all stuck with each other.Catherine sends the girls outside, and tries to convince Walter that they must work together, and their main concern must be the children: He must let them have the hut, and help her keep them safe and secure; above all, he must stop swearing and drinking in front of them...after all, he is the ""Father"" figure. Walter retorts that he has no intention of being a ""Father"" figure...all he intends to be is a ""Total Stranger"" figure. He tells her to get out and let him get some sleep. He defiantly takes off his pants in front of her, and lies down on the cot. She leaves...but a few moments later her little guerilla fighters attack the hut with sticks and coconuts. Walter comes outside with a blanket wrapped around his waist, pants over his arm, and a bottle in his hand...""Lady,"" he says to her threateningly, ""you're making a powerful enemy."" But it's an empty threat, and they all know it. He retreats to his boat, where he will stay for the duration.Later, one of the girls comes down to the boat to fetch him: Frank is on the radio. Walter hurries off to the shack...not noticing the girl stays behind, and beckons to the others, who have hidden in the trees nearby.Walter finds Catherine alone in the shack, mending a piece of clothing. He looks around nonchalantly for the whiskey...""I asked you to stop drinking in front of the girls,"" she says, primly, ""but you wouldn't."" She has hidden it all away again, to Walter's supreme frustration!Frank is no longer on the radio, but he left a message, and after some suspicious fumbling and stalling, Catherine finally produces it. Frank has been unable to arrange a parachute drop...they'll have to make do with what they have. Catherine asks Walter if he would consider sharing some of his personal belongings with her and the girls. He tells her he'd trade for his whiskey. She declines, and he leaves.As he starts back down to the boat, the girls run past him one by one, each concealing a bundle of clothing, tools, blankets, which they've taken from his boat. As the last little girl runs by, Walter finally gets wise...he tries to stop her, and she hits him on the toe with the hammer she's stealing. By the time he recovers, all the girls are inside the hut with Catherine standing guard. Out-maneuvered again, he retreats to his empty, empty boat.He keeps a watch on the hut, and on Catherine and the girls, now wearing bits, pieces and weirdly-altered versions of his clothes. There's Elizabeth (Stephanie Berrington), 14, pretty, but shy and bespectacled; Anne (Pip Sparke), 12, sullen and aloof, whose answer to every question is, ""I want to go home""; Harriet (Jennifer Berrington), ten, a cheerful tomboy who prefers to be called Harry; the French twins, Angelique and Dominique (Laurelle and Nicole Felsette), nine, who speak only French, but may understand more than they let on; Christine (Verina Greenlaw), about eight, a no-nonsense little Brit, with an invisible friend, Gretchen; Jenny (Sharyl Locke), also British, around six or seven, very quiet and sad. He waits for his chance: he'll give up the hut, and they can have the clothes...but he wants that whiskey!One day he spots a Japanese destroyer in the bay, and an inflatable raft with four armed Japanese sailors coming ashore. He runs up to the shack and finds only Catherine and Christine there. The rest are on the beach gathering coconuts. He and Catherine run down quickly to find them. They find four of them coming back from the beach, their arms full of coconuts, and send them back to the shack to hide. They continue to the beach, where they find Anne perched precariously, but more or less hidden, high up in a palm, near where the sailors are landing. Jenny is nowhere to be seen. Walter motions to Anne to stay where she is, and he and Catherine crouch down behind a couple of fallen logs. The sailors set off down the beach, away from them...just as Jenny appears, oblivious to what's going on, to add two more coconuts to the pile under the palm. Walter whispers to Catherine that if Jenny makes a sound they're done...Catherine murmurs that Jenny hasn't spoken since she left her parents. ""She can still scream, can't she?"" says Walter grimly, and runs swiftly to Jenny while the sailors' backs are turned. He puts his hand over her mouth to silence any outcry (managing not to cry out himself, when Jenny give him a good, hard bite), and hides her until the sailors are out of sight. Then he brings her back, frightened and crying, to Catherine, who comforts and quiets her.It turns out that Catherine understands Japanese, and she tells Walter that they are trying to find turtles for soup. Unable to find any, the Japanese return to the dinghy, and shove off. They don't leave a moment too soon: Anne is slipping from her perch. Walter manages to get under her, and, quietly but painfully, break her fall. When the sailors are back on board, and the ship is out of sight, they all leave the beach. No one notices that the bright red bandana Anne was wearing (one of Walter's) has snagged in the fronds of the palm.Walter is working on his boat when Jenny suddenly appears, staring silently over the railing at him. He looks back at her for a moment, surprised, then tells her to beat it. She produces a bottle of whiskey, and sets it on the railing near him. Dumbfounded, he looks at it, then at her...and says, ""Thank you"", in a slightly hoarse voice. He removes the cap, takes a healthy swig, and thanks her again. He asks her name--she doesn't answer. He produces a small silver whistle on a chain, and asks if she'd like to have it. She nods. ""All you have to do is repeat three words after me."" She nods again. ""Elephant,"" he says. After a pause, she repeats, ""Elephant."" ""Rhinoceros,"" says Walter. ""Rhinoceros,"" she repeats. ""Wrong!"" says Walter. ""Why?"" she demands, indignantly. ""No, not 'Why'..,"" says Walter, "" 'Wrong!' That was the third word--you lose."" He puts the whistle back in his pocket...and Jenny snatches back the whiskey. Muttering about poor losers, Walter hands her the whistle, and she returns the whiskey. He takes another swig, and when he looks again, Harry is standing next to Jenny, smiling happily. They offer to help him fix his boat, and he tells them they can swab down the deck. Soon all the girls are there, working on the boat in one capacity or another.Catherine arrives, looking for the girls, and she's astonished to find them here. She orders them back to the shack for lessons, but Jenny protests that they'd rather stay and help Mr. Eckland. Catherine stares at Jenny in surprise, and Elizabeth brightly explains that Mr. Eckland got her to talk. ""Better do as she says,"" Walter tells the girls, and reluctantly they head back to the shack. A little jealous, Catherine says tartly that next time she needs the girls to do anything, she'll just call on him. ""It's not my fault that boats are more fun than lessons,"" he replies, mildly. As he's talking, he wades out into the lagoon a little way. He crouches, and after a moment plunges his hands into the water and skillfully flips a fish onto the shore. ""Why don't you teach them something useful, like that?"" he says. Catherine tries it, but fails miserably. Walter approaches to show her how it's done...but standing so close to her, he suddenly realizes that he's very...attracted to her. Startled, he backs away. Confused, Catherine asks, ""Mr. Eckland, are you or aren't you going to teach me to fish?"" After a moment's consideration, he replies ""I aren't"". He wades deeper into the lagoon, and begins to swim away, while she watches, mystified.Catherine and Anne are foraging for berries, near a little pond. Catherine slips off a log, into the water. ""Oh... Something bit me"", she exclaims, and looks at two little holes near her left ankle. ""A snake, a snake!"" cries Anne, pointing to a long, dark shape in the water nearby. Catherine jumps out of the water, and they flee to the hut. After a moment, the dark shape emerges fully from the water: it's only a branch, with thorns and a couple of wilted leaves.Catherine is on the cot surrounded by the girls when Walter comes in, summoned by one of the French twins. Catherine briefly explains what happened; he sends the girls out, and examines the tiny wound gravely. With his knife (sterilized over the stove's flame) he makes a small cut across the marks, and attempts to suck out the venom. Then he calls Frank on the radio: ""What kind of snakes have they got around here?"" he asks. ""Uh, is that a rhetorical question, I hope?"" asks Frank, warily. ""Miss Freneau went and found one,"" replies Walter, evenly. Frank sends Stebbings for a doctor, and tells Walter to stand by. ""And Walter,"" he adds, ""until we know what we're dealing with, don't try to be a movie hero and suck out the venom, ok?"" Walter and Catherine look at each other a little sheepishly.Frank returns shortly, and asks Walter to put on the headphones. The doctor tells him there are three varieties of snakes indigenous to the islands, all extremely poisonous. Nothing can be done for Catherine...the end will come very soon: She'll experience a general feeling of numbness, then dizziness, and then death. The doctor tells Walter to make her comfortable, and recommends the liberal use of any strong, analgesic sedative he may have on hand to do so. ""I don't have anything like that,"" protests Walter, and Frank replies, ""Nonsense, Walter, you've been using one for years.""Walter persuades Catherine to tell him where he can find a bottle of whiskey...best medicine for snakebite, after all. She drains her first coconut cupful quickly...and as he pours another, she tells him she doesn't disapprove of drinking, only excessive drinking. As she's working on her third cupful, she says that after the death of her mother, she served as hostess at all consulate functions. ""We had martinis before dinner, white wine with the fish,"" she says, running through the checklist, ""red wine with the main course, champagne with dessert, cognac with coffee, and port after dinner."" Walter takes a swig of the whiskey and comments enviously, ""Sounds GREAT!""After her fifth drink, Catherine observes that it's getting very hot in the shack...and seems unable to keep from waving her very limber legs in the air and giggling. She asks Walter what her blood tasted like. After some discussion as to whether or not it was too salty, Walter decides the girls don't need to watch all of this, and closes the blinds and the curtain over the door. They can still listen, though, and while they're doing so, Anne suddenly shouts she's going to kill that rotten snake, and runs off toward the pond.Catherine admits she's obsessively disciplined. ""I'm a picture-straightener,"" she laments. ""Whenever I see a picture hanging crookedly, I straighten it. And I brush my teeth every morning and every night, no matter what."" She tells him that she's lived in 11 countries and speaks seven languages...that she once had a fiance named Cesare...he worked for the Italian Consulate, and whenever he kissed her, he would first ask ""Permesso"", and afterward he would say ""Grazie."" She giggles wildly, and tells Walter that Cesare would never have done to her leg what he did. She tells him earnestly that she liked what he did to her leg.Then she asks Walter what ""she"" was like. ""What 'who' was like?"" asks Walter. ""The woman who drove you to this,"" she says, gesturing all around her, to the shack, the island...to his solitary life. ""It was no woman,"" he replies, ""it was a necktie."" Believing that she will not live to pass the story on, he tells her that eight years ago, he'd been a professor of history at an American university. One morning, in a rush, he'd gone to class without his necktie...and they'd refused to let him in. He'd thought they'd care more about the content of his brain than what he wore around his neck, but he'd looked at them, then, and realized they all wore neckties. They all looked the same, talked the same, and thought the same, and they weren't learning anything...at least nothing he had to teach...and they were perpetuating the same old problems. So he'd packed up and departed for the South Seas the next day.Catherine listens with interest...then giggles to think that he was once a school teacher...then remarks that she's beginning to feel numb. Recognizing this symptom of approaching death, he helps her lie back on the cot. ""Oh, I'm dizzy,"" she murmurs, ""I'm so dizzy!"" She suddenly sits up and exclaims, ""Oh, dear!"" in a surprised little voice...and passes out cold.Walter assumes she is dead. Slowly, gently, he takes the cup of whiskey from her hand, crosses her hands on her breast and pulls the blanket up over her face. Then he drinks the whiskey left in her cup (waste not, want not!)Meanwhile, Anne has returned, carrying the snake-resembling branch in her hand. ""What's that?"" asks Elizabeth. ""It's the snake,"" replies Anne. ""That's not a snake,"" says Jenny. ""It LOOKED like a snake,"" says Anne. ""You ninny!"" declares Christine. ""Oh, la!"" sighs one of the little French twins.Walter calls Frank: ""It's over,"" he says, ""Miss Freneau is...gone."" ""I'm sorry, Walter,"" says Frank. ""Have the girls been told?"" ""No,"" replies Walter, ""Stick around, why don't you...I may need you later.""Walter comes out and sits down on the porch, and the girls gather around him. He tells them gently that Miss Freneau is gone. They tell him earnestly that she's not. Anne produces the stick, and he asks, ""What's that?"" ""It's the snake,"" says Anne. ""Well, that's not a snake,"" he replies. ""It LOOKED like a snake,"" says Anne. She hands it to him, he looks at it, and after a moment, agrees, ""That looks like a snake."" He goes back inside, and pulls the cover back from Catherine's face. Her eyes open, and she looks at him, quizzically....""Is it morning already?"" she asks, and he covers her up again. He goes back to the radio, and calls Frank. Frank has summoned the chaplain to say a few words of comfort. ""Never mind,"" says Walter. ""Miss Freneau's alive. It's the snake that's dead."" Leaving Frank sputtering on the radio, he takes what's left of the bottle of whiskey, and heads back to his boat.He's tinkering with the patch he's rigged for the hull when Catherine, walking gingerly due to a monstrous hangover, comes in to talk to him. She asks him if she said or did anything for which she'd need to apologize. He tells her no...except when she put the flower between her teeth and danced naked around the room. ""I couldn't' have done that!"" she protests, then asks doubtfully, ""Did I?"" He asks her what she does remember. She replies nothing, really, and he relaxes. Or at least, she adds, nothing after his story about the necktie, she adds, and he explodes. He shouts at her that he never wants to hear about that again. She doesn't see why it should bother him so much, she'd thought he was running away from something much worse. He shouts that he wasn't running away, he was escaping...from hypocrits like her who have to get drunk to let themselves go. ""If you'd start letting men wear their own pants, maybe they'd feel they could touch you without asking 'Permesso',"" he shouts. Catherine slaps his face, crisply. He thinks about it...and slaps her back, not hard, but with sincerity. She isn't hurt, physically, but her face crumples into tears, and she runs off the boat. Walter watches her go with the beginnings of shame on his face.Later, as the girls are sitting down to dinner, Walter arrives at the front door. ""Look,"" says Jenny, in wonder, ""he's combed his hair."" ""And he's actually wearing socks,"" says Christine, awed. He apologizes for interrupting, and says he thought that if they had any extra food, he might... Catherine jumps up to prepare a plate for him. She is wearing the suit jacket and skirt she wore when they first met. They look at each other shyly, knowingly, and she sits down and passes the plate she has fixed for him down the table.""I'm tired of tinned beef,"" says Anne. ""Why can't we ever have fish?"" ""Professor Eckland was giving me fishing lessons,"" says Catherine, demurely...""but he never finishes what he starts!"" Walter chokes on the bite of food he's just swallowed...the nearest girls all begin to pound on his back, while the others shout advice. In the midst of the confusion, practical little Jenny brings him a bottle of whiskey. He takes off the cap and prepares to have a swig...but Catherine says, ""Uh-uh-uh, Mr. Eckland,"" and he reluctantly, but respectfully, puts the bottle aside. Shuddering a little, he has a sip of coconut milk instead.Suddenly, they hear a plane...very loud and close. A Japanese pilot has spotted the red bandana in the coconut tree, and is flying by it repeatedly, trying to figure it out. Walter runs out of the shack, and watches the plane from behind a palm tree, as it circles around. When it's gone, he immediately calls Frank. But Frank is unimpressed, convinced this is another ruse on Walter's part to get off the island. Angry, Walter stalks out of the shack, knowing that at some point the plane will come back.Later, Catherine comes down to his boat, to talk to him about the girls. She notices that the hole has been patched and he's working on the engine now. The talk turns to their own situation, and raised voices follow as they try to deny they have feelings for each other. Finally, after Catherine calls Walter a drunken escapist, and he calls her a frustrated old spinster, Catherine slaps Walter's face again...and Walter slaps her right back. But instead of running away this time, Catherine gets a very determined look on her face, and slaps him again. Walter pauses, considering what to do next.Stebbings calls to Frank, and tells him that Walter is requesting a chaplain. ""Good heavens,"" Frank exclaims, ""he's finally killed her!"" ""No,"" declares Stebbings, ""they want to get married!"" ""Married?!?"" says Frank, astounded, ""Goody Two Shoes and The Filthy Beast?!?""A chaplain is summoned, and a sailor with an accordian. Catherine has put her hair up, and all the girls have dressed in their neat school uniforms. Walter has dressed up again, and even fastened his collar button. Harry removes her necktie and offers it to Walter. ""Oh, no thank you, Harry,"" says Catherine, ""neckties don't suit Mr. Eckland,"" signifying that she's ready to accept him ""as is"".Frank says he needs to fill out a little paper work on their behalf...they each tell their full name for the record, and each smiles a little at hearing the other's for the first time. Frank asks the name of the maid of honor, Catherine supplies Elizabeth's name, and Elizabeth looks pleased. Frank asks the name of the best man...Walter looks around at the girls, and finally announces, ""Harry MacGregor."" Harry smiles radiantly.The sailor begins to play ""Oh Promise Me"" on his accordian, and the chaplain begins to read the text. Just as he asks if there are any objections to the marriage, the angry sound of an airplane engine interrupts them. Walter runs to the door, and looks up...the Japanese fighter plane has returned, and is lining up for a strafing run on the shack. They dive for cover just in time, as bullets rip through the shack. The plane turns around for a second run, and they scurry out to hide in the trees. Walter darts back inside, while the plane turns around for a third run...he interrupts the chaplain who is droning on about Walter taking this woman, and asks for Frank. He tells Frank the plane has returned. Frank is still doubtful, but Walter leaves the mike open so Frank can hear the bullets from the plane's last run, and Frank hurries off to make arrangements to get them all off the island.Catherine runs into the shack to make sure Walter's all right, and the chaplain asks if there's anything he can do. The plane has gone, so Walter tells the chaplain to finish the ceremony. Lying under the table in the ruined shack, and using a bandaid for a ring, Walter and Catherine are pronounced man and wife. Frank breaks in at this point, and tells Walter that an American sub is running submerged a few miles away. When they surface at nightfall, he'll get a radio message to them, and they should be able to make Matalava by dawn. He advises them to stay away from the hut, to sleep on the beach and be ready to signal the sub when it arrives.That night, as Walter and Catherine keep watch over the sleeping girls, she whispers to him, ""You'll not be coming with us, will you?"" ""I can't leave the boat,"" he replies. ""It must be a good one,"" she says, wistfully. ""Good or bad, it's all the dowry you're going to get,"" he responds. ""I'm thinking of starting a charter service, after the war...somewhere around the Solomons or maybe the New Hebrides. There'll be good money for anybody with a boat who knows the islands."" Walter, it seems, has plans to rejoin the human race for Catherine's sake.At dawn, they hear the sound of a heavy engine approaching. But as the ship comes into view, they see it's not the promised American submarine, it's a Japanese patrol boat. Walter hurries the girls off the beach, telling Catherine to hide with them at his launch. Trying to distract and delay them, Walter runs up to the shack, and sets it on fire. Two rubber rafts have landed, with a dozen or so armed Japanese sailors. He ducks them as they run toward the shack, and runs down to their rafts on the beach, slashing them with his knife to deflate them.Catherine and the girls are hiding, but come out when he returns to the launch. Catherine points to the transom, where Walter has neatly painted ""Catherine"", with ""Matalava"" underneath, and asks when he did that. ""Last night while you slept,"" he says...and adds in a meaningful tone, ""There wasn't much else to do."" He tells them to get into the dinghy, but to stay hidden in the lagoon. The sub will not surface while the patrol boat is there, but they will be watching, and he will decoy the patrol boat out past the reef where the sub can sink it. As he jumps into the launch, Catherine calls after him to be careful...""I look simply awful in black,"" she says.On the submarine, just outside the bay, the captain and the mate are taking turns watching the hut burn through the periscope. They see Walter's launch dart out of the lagoon, and watch as the patrol boat comes about to pursue it. The patrol boat is firing on and lobbing shells at the launch...some of the shots come perilously close. The captain watches tensely as both boats approach the reef, and as the launch crosses over it, he orders the torpedos readied. Just as the patrol boat clears the reef, one of the Japanese boat's shells hits its mark... and the launch is blown to smithereens. The captain orders the torpedos to be fired, and the patrol boat is itself destroyed. The captain orders the mate to surface and look for survivors...without much hope.Catherine and the girls have piloted the dinghy out into the bay, and they are desperately looking through the wreckage of the launch for Walter. The motor has stalled, and Catherine is frantically trying to get it started again. One of the girls notices Walter's hat floating by, and Catherine sorrowfully reaches out to retrieve it. Suddenly Walter himself swims up to the boat, and they greet him joyously. At the last second, he'd been able to tie off the wheel and jump overboard. ""I'm sorry about our boat,"" Catherine says. ""Well, in a war, everybody loses something,"" he says, philosophically...""I'm just glad it was THAT Catherine."" She leans down to kiss him, and he tells her to wait just a moment, and let him get in the dinghy. He puts a leg up over the side, and the boat rocks ominously. The girls squeal, and Catherine protests that he's going to tip them in. ""No, no, no,"" he says, ""this will work...all of you get over to that side. Look, will you just do it MY way for once?""In the next scene, the little boat is upside down in the water. Walter, Catherine, and all the girls are sitting on top of it, soaking wet. They all look at Walter accusingly. ""Shut up,"" he says, morosely. The sub commander has been watching, and smiles. ""Looks like we're going to be taking on passengers after all,"" he tells the mate. As the sub approaches, Walter muses, ""I wonder if they serve coconut milk on submarines.""

"14","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058586/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is called to the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders) to investigate the murder of his chauffeur, Miguel Ostos. The chauffeur was having an affair with one of the maids, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), and attacked her in her bedroom after she broke off with him. Miguel was shot and killed in her bedroom and Maria was found with the smoking gun in her hand, but claims no knowledge of how it got there as she maintains she was knocked unconscious. All evidence points to Maria as the killer, but Clouseau is convinced of her innocence because he has developed an immediate attraction to her. Realizing Clouseau has been inadvertently assigned to a high profile case, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) has him removed and personally takes charge of the investigation.Dejected, Clouseau returns home. He is awakened in the early hours of the morning by an apparent attempt on his life by a Chinese assassin. When the phone rings, the life or death struggle ceases and it becomes apparent that his assailant is his valet, Kato (Burt Kwouk), to whom Clouseau has given instructions to attack him when he least expects it to keep his senses sharp. The Inspector is reinstated to the Ballon case and immediately orders Maria Gambrelli's release from prison, as he is convinced she is shielding the real killer, who Clouseau suspects is Ballon himself.A series of additional murders of the Ballon staff follows. Each time the evidence points to Maria, who is continually arrested, only to have Clouseau release her again despite the growing number of murder charges laid at her feet. One of which involves, both Clouseau and Maria being arrested after fleeing from a nudist colony... without their clothes.Clouseau's actions embarrass the Sûreté in the press, but Commissioner Dreyfus is unable to remove him from the case because Ballon has exerted political influence to keep the unorthodox and seemingly incompetent detective assigned to the investigation. As Clouseau continues to bungle the case, Commissioner Dreyfus becomes increasingly unhinged and suffers a nervous breakdown that reduces him to a delusional psychotic. He stalks Clouseau in order to assassinate him, but accidentally kills a series of innocent bystanders instead and adds further notoriety to the case.When Clouseau confronts the Ballon household to unmask the murderer, it is revealed that Ballon, his wife (Tracy Reed), and three members of the staff are all guilty, as each of them has killed at least one earlier victim due to crimes of passion or subsequent blackmail attempts. Only Maria is innocent of any crime. As a massive row breaks out between employers and staff, the lights are cut (an arrangement Clouseau had made with his assistant), and the guilty take the opportunity to pile into Clouseau's car and escape. They are all killed when the car is destroyed by a bomb that had been planted by Commissioner Dreyfus. Having witnessed the explosion, and realizing that he has failed again to kill Clouseau, Dreyfus is reduced to an animalistic fury and is taken away. Clouseau and Maria celebrate the clearing of her name with a long and passionate kisswhich is swiftly interrupted by another sneak attack by Kato.","

    Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is called to the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders) to investigate the murder of his chauffeur, Miguel Ostos. The chauffeur was having an affair with one of the maids, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), and attacked her in her bedroom after she broke off with him. Miguel was shot and killed in her bedroom and Maria was found with the smoking gun in her hand, but claims no knowledge of how it got there as she maintains she was knocked unconscious. All evidence points to Maria as the killer, but Clouseau is convinced of her innocence because he has developed an immediate attraction to her. Realizing Clouseau has been inadvertently assigned to a high profile case, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) has him removed and personally takes charge of the investigation.Dejected, Clouseau returns home. He is awakened in the early hours of the morning by an apparent attempt on his life by a Chinese assassin. When the phone rings, the life or death struggle ceases and it becomes apparent that his assailant is his valet, Kato (Burt Kwouk), to whom Clouseau has given instructions to attack him when he least expects it to keep his senses sharp. The Inspector is reinstated to the Ballon case and immediately orders Maria Gambrelli's release from prison, as he is convinced she is shielding the real killer, who Clouseau suspects is Ballon himself.A series of additional murders of the Ballon staff follows. Each time the evidence points to Maria, who is continually arrested, only to have Clouseau release her again despite the growing number of murder charges laid at her feet. One of which involves, both Clouseau and Maria being arrested after fleeing from a nudist colony... without their clothes.Clouseau's actions embarrass the Sûreté in the press, but Commissioner Dreyfus is unable to remove him from the case because Ballon has exerted political influence to keep the unorthodox and seemingly incompetent detective assigned to the investigation. As Clouseau continues to bungle the case, Commissioner Dreyfus becomes increasingly unhinged and suffers a nervous breakdown that reduces him to a delusional psychotic. He stalks Clouseau in order to assassinate him, but accidentally kills a series of innocent bystanders instead and adds further notoriety to the case.When Clouseau confronts the Ballon household to unmask the murderer, it is revealed that Ballon, his wife (Tracy Reed), and three members of the staff are all guilty, as each of them has killed at least one earlier victim due to crimes of passion or subsequent blackmail attempts. Only Maria is innocent of any crime. As a massive row breaks out between employers and staff, the lights are cut (an arrangement Clouseau had made with his assistant), and the guilty take the opportunity to pile into Clouseau's car and escape. They are all killed when the car is destroyed by a bomb that had been planted by Commissioner Dreyfus. Having witnessed the explosion, and realizing that he has failed again to kill Clouseau, Dreyfus is reduced to an animalistic fury and is taken away. Clouseau and Maria celebrate the clearing of her name with a long and passionate kisswhich is swiftly interrupted by another sneak attack by Kato.

The Man in Red (John Westbrook) calls to her, sitting under a tree. Causing a white rose to turn red, he gives it to her, telling her to take it to her village with the message that the day of their deliverance is at hand. She takes it and bows in honor. A royal carriage enters the village of Catania. Prince Prospero (Vincent Price) is making a personal appearance to invite the villagers to a feast. Gino (David Weston) pulls a baby out of the way just in time to keep it from being run over by the horses and carriage. Prospero gets out and begins inviting people to his feast. Gino sarcastically mouths that they will only receive scraps from his table like dogs. Gino tells Prospero that a holy man told an old woman that they would be delivered from his reign of terror. His father-in-law Ludovico (Nigel Green) comes up beside him. Prospero suggests that they should be on their knees thanking him. With a signal to his guards, the two men are lowered to their knees and strong-armed. Francesca (Jane Asher) runs up and begs for mercy. Prospero questions her and tells her that she must decide whether her father or her husband will die. Alfredo (Patrick Magee) comes up, remarking what entertainment this is for him and how innocent the girl is. Prospero promises that soon he will corrupt her and calls for Francesca to make a decision. A scream is heard and a guard sent to see about it. When the scream continues, Prospero goes himself. In a hut the guard is stunned. Prospero asks what it is, and the guard can only point and tell him to look. The old Grandmother has broken out with the Red Death (red spots on her face). Returning to the others, Prospero questions whether the three had any contact with the woman. When he determines they did not, he tells the guards to take the two men to the castle and he will take the girl. They are loaded up and Prospero tells the guards to burn the village. Gino questions why and Prospero tells him it is his deliverance. At the palace Prospero orders invitations to those whom he wants to attend his feast. Francesca is stripped by maidens and thrown into a hot bath. Prospero enters with Juliana (Hazel Court) and orders the maidens out. Francesca covers herself in modesty. Prospero questions why and asks whether the cross she wears is ornamental or symbolic of her faith. She attests to being a true believer and he orders her to remove it and never wear it again in the castle. He tells Juliana that after her bath to clothe Francesca in her finest gowns. Francesca asks about her father and Gino and is told they are being quartered. Prospero leaves and Juliana assures Francesca that she has not made a good impression on him. Francesca asks if Juliana will do as Prospero has told her. She replies that she will do as he says, as they all must. At the feast, Alfredo tells a woman he will tell her about terror. Prospero, overhearing, asks what he knows of terror. He calls him away into another room. Everyone follows. He questions whether terror is hearing the sounds of time ticking away as he walks past an antiquated clock. He suggests terror may be the sound of a heartbeat in fear or the sound of footsteps approaching. He introduces dancers Esmeralda (Verina Greenlaw) and Hop Toad (Skip Martin) who will entertain. Musicians enter playing and a dwarf, a young girl and a long-haired dog. As Esmeralda dances, Alfredo approaches Prospero, asking about her. Suddenly the girl knocks over a wine drink. Alfredo slaps her and she falls. Hop Toad begins to draw his knife, but upon seeing the anger of Prospero and Alfredo, he instead comes to raise up Esmeralda. Prospero leads Alfredo away, claiming the first act has disappointed but then throws wine in the face of Alfredo, who threatens him. Prospero then tells everyone they are lucky to be in the palace and safe from the Red Death which will spread the countryside. He invites everyone to a masquerade ball the following day at midnight, offering costumes to everyones use. He advises them not to wear red. Francesca enters in a white gown and is introduced to everyone by Prospero. First she is introduced to Señor Veronese (Julian Burton), who is told to act like a pig. He gets on the floor and rolls around as everyone laughs at him. Next Prospero calls for Señor Lampredi (Brian Hewlitt) to become a worm on the floor. He crawls around to everyones amusement. Prospero calls for Señora Escobar (Gaye Brown) to play a braying jackass. Señor Rivoli (Harvey Hall) is told to ride the jackass. Prospero tells everyone else to act like animals. Francesca is horrified. As Francesca is led away by Prospero into private quarters, Alfredo looks on with desire. In a yellow room Prospero tells her that his father once imprisoned a man there for three years. When the man was freed, he no longer could look at the sun or a daffodil. Prospero tells her that it was a test to control a mans mind. In a purple room he tells her that he doesnt believe in God; if God existed He must have died long ago. He believes someone or something exists in His place. Francesca believes in love and the goodness of God. Before they go into another room Prospero tells her she is not ready to enter that room. He tells her to rest from her long day. He promises her that the next day she will see Gino and her father. Prospero, roaming the castle later, is confronted by Juliana, who tells him she is ready to enter the deeper ceremonies which he believes in. He laughingly suggests that she is only ready because she wants to secure her position. In her room Francesca is awakened by the sound of wind. She goes over to a sconce that has gone out. As she turns back, she sees blood on a book and screams. Next she hears Prospero chanting in Latin. Putting on her robe, she goes out to investigate. She goes downstairs, following the sound of his voice. Entering the yellow room, she goes through the purple room and finds the door open to the next room. She goes through it into a black room where she sees Juliana and a raven cawing. Seeing Prospero lying in a coffin looking dead, she goes to touch his face. At that moment he opens his eyes and she screams and runs away. She is startled by Alfredo who is wearing a mask. The next day Prospero shows Francesca a falcon which kills another bird. He tells her it is trained by blinding its eyes until it becomes a slave to its master. He says that God blinded people with the cross and that he serves a different master. She begins to say that he forced her to remove her cross because it offended him. He interrupts her, saying that it offends no one following his master. He felt that it was discourteous to wear the symbol of a dead God. He confesses his master is Satan, Lord of Flies, the Fallen Angel and the Devil. Hearing a horn blowing, he tells her to come. Going to the battlement, he looks down as a carriage arrives. Scarlatti (Paul Whitsun-Jones) demands entrance to the castle as an invited guest. Prospero tells him he is no longer welcome due to the Red Death. He begs for sanctuary and offers up his wife to the Prince. Prospero informs him he has already had that doubtful pleasure. Begging for Prospero to spare him from the Red Death in the name of friendship, Scarlatti receives an arrow below the throat. Prospero throws down a dagger for the wife to kill herself with. In the dungeon, a sword is thrown down before Gino, who is told to learn to fight. He refuses to fight his friend. A swordfight ensues. Prospero and Francesca enter and witness the fight. When Gino wins, he tells Prospero that he will not fight his friend. Prospero promises torture, but Gino tells him that that would be considered losing. Intrigued, Prospero promises that after some thinking he will match the two together in a death fight. Walking through the dungeon, Prospero tells Francesca that sometimes life is cruel. She winces at the sound of a man in pain. She asks if Satan requires torture in his worship. He tells her of a Christian monk many years ago who tortured men, women and children in order to save their souls. He blames this on God. He promises to lead her into the ways of Satan. She refuses. Juliana prays and offers herself to Satan, branding her chest with an upside-down cross and asks to be made into a demon. Alfredo has a conversation with Hop Toad, who desires to serve someone other than Prospero. He promises his talents if Alfredo will take him in. Hop Toad persuades him to come to the ball in the costume of an ape which he will provide. Alfredo is pleased. Francesca hears someone trying to get into her bedroom door. She rises and stands aside as the door opens. Juliana comes in and Francesca sees the brand on her chest, asking if Prospero did it. Juliana admits she did it herself, marking her as a handmaiden of Satan. She tells Francesca that there is one more ceremony where she gives her soul to the devil to be immortal. She is hoping to be bound to Prospero and that Francesca would be out of the way. When Francesca tells her she would love to escape, Juliana gives her a key to the cell and urges her to free Gino and her father and escape. Francesca wanders through the dungeon, passing several men in the throes of torture. Finding the cell with Gino and her father, she frees them. As they pass the guard room, one of the guards sees someone go by and goes to check. A fight ensues with Gino, Ludovico and two guards. Coming out onto the battlement, Gino calls to a guard who turns to face him. It is Prospero, who calls out his guards. Francesca tells him that Juliana betrayed them. Prospero tells her Juliana betrayed him and that one of the two men must die for their sins. At the party, people are seated at long tables as waiters bring platters of food. Dancers and musicians perform. Prospero stands and calls for their attention. He announces that at midnight the masks will go on. He states that some among them still harbor good thoughts. He calls for the next entertainment to come in. Gino and Ludovico come in and stand before him. He throws down five daggers, one of which he says contains a poison that kills in five seconds. He tells them to each cut themselves with one of the daggers. Ludovico goes first, followed by Gino, then Ludovico again and Gino. The final dagger is taken by Ludovico, who tries to stab Prospero across the table with it. Ludovico is stabbed by a sword and falls dead. Prospero calls for them both to be killed since the game was not done correctly. Francesca begs for Ginos life. Prospero announces that he will not kill Gino, but release him so that he can die of the Red Death. Taunting Gino about his God, Prospero asks where his God is now. Gino says he will meet Him in paradise. The command is given to release him and Gino swears he will somehow return for Francesca. Francesca tells Prospero to allow her to go with Gino, which he refuses. Then she says bring him back and she will submit herself to whatever he wishes. At this point Juliana calls from across the room, telling the Prince that she is ready for the final ceremony. Gino is cast out of the castle and runs through the forest. The sounds of Prosperos fiendish laughter and the screams of Francesca are heard on the wind. As he stumbles on, he sees the Man in Red sitting under a tree, playing Tarot cards. Asking how it is going, Gino confesses that he has killed and that he is afraid for Francesca and afraid of Prosperos castle. The Man in Red gives Gino one of his cards as a sign. Gino takes it and returns to the castle. Meanwhile Alfredo is trying on the ape costume. Hop Toad directs him as how to walk slumped over and swinging his arms. He tells Alfredo that he can remove the costume once the unmasking is done. Gino finds a group of villagers heading for the castle to ask forgiveness and receive sanctuary. One woman is carried on a stretcher with the Red Death. Gino tries to stop them but is pushed aside. Juliana begins her ceremony, chanting at the altar. She drinks ceremonial wine drugged with hallucinogens. In the dreams she runs through hazy corridors and then finds herself on an altar. She is horrified to see five different men who wield weapons over her. When she comes to, she hears the laughter of Prospero and calls out to him. Searching from room to room, she tells him that she is now betrothed to the devil. He says there are more horrors to come. In the main room, she approaches the swinging pendulum and hears the voice of Prospero telling her that her fears have just begun. At this point she is attacked by one or more ravens that leave her dead and bloodied on the floor. One woman finds her and cries out. Prospero approaches with the other guests and tells the woman not to grieve for Juliana, for she has wed the devil. He calls for the masquerade to begin. Outside, the villagers arrive and call for mercy. They are told to return to Catania. One guard is sent to fetch Prospero. Gino tries to dissuade the elders from groveling before the Prince. They refuse. Prospero comes out and tells them to go back where they came. When they refuse, he commands his archers to slay them. Inside, Prospero throws jewels down to the people, who scramble to gather them. He tells Francesca that all of these rich people suffer from greed and are desperate for more riches. Then he tells them to rejoice because the remaining villagers are now dead. He has promised all inside his castle will be safe from the Red Death. He tells Francesca that soon she will be initiated into understanding. Prospero and Francesca are seen dancing with the others. Gino climbs the castle walls with a makeshift rope he has made from vines. At the battlement he sees the Man in Red, who tells him to wait until one oclock at which time Francesca will be sent out to him. Gino is anxious to rescue her but is told to be wise. When he is shown a dead guard, he looks back and the Man in Red has vanished. Hop Toad enters the room of Esmeralda and tells her to be ready to leave the castle later when he comes for her. She tells him that she trusts him. At the party, Hop Toad and the ape make their appearance. Hop Toad cracks his whip, telling everyone that he controls the ape. As the ape seizes a woman and falls to the floor with her, Hop Toad unties a rope holding up a light fixture of candles and lowers it just above them. Citing that the ape is out of control, Hop Toad ties him to the candle fixture and lifts him up in the air. Alfredo complains and demands to be released but Hop Toad tells him he has insulted Esmeralda too much and deserves to pay. Dousing the ape with brandy, Hop Toad sets him on fire. As the party goers look on, their laughter changes to screams as the ape burns. The fixture collapses and Prospero calls for the guards to remove it. Hop Toad leaves the room and Prospero calls for a reward to be given to him. Across the crowded dance floor, Prospero sees the Man in Red. Telling Francesca that he commanded that no one should wear red, he follows through the different rooms. In the black room, he is confronted by the Man in Red (whose face is covered). Prospero tries to guess who it is, saying the voice is familiar. Suspecting that it is the devil himself, he makes Francesca bow down. Prospero calls for the man to show his face but is told that he will only see it upon his own death. He tells Prospero that the unmasking will reveal everyones faces soon. Leaving the room, the Man in Red calls for a new dance to begin. Prospero follows. With each wave of his hands, the Man in Red spreads the Red Death to those at the party. Prospero is pleased and remarks that he led all these friends to Satan and corrupted them for him. He asks that Francesca be spared and the Man in Red tells her to go to the battlements. Prospero tells her that he will join her when this is over. Prospero addresses the Man in Red, who denies being the devil. He says that he is death. Prospero insists that his own pact with Satan will save him. The Man in Red says that it will not. Prospero removes the mask to see his face. He is horrified to see his own face, made red from the Red Death. Prospero is then taken by all the guests who jostle him around the room. As the people begin to collapse from the Red Death, Prospero is the only one left standing. He retreats to the black room, hoping to escape from a horrible death. In that room he finds the red-cloaked figure, who strikes him with the Red Death. The Man in Red is seen playing cards with the young girl from the village. Several other men arrive and give reports of the deaths of many. The Man in Red tells them that only six survived: one man and woman, a dwarf and small lady and the girl from the village.","

Francesca tells Prospero to allow her to go with Gino, which he refuses. Then she says bring him back and she will submit herself to whatever he wishes. At this point Juliana calls from across the room, telling the Prince that she is ready for the final ceremony. 
Gino is cast out of the castle and runs through the forest. The sounds of Prosperos fiendish laughter and the screams of Francesca are heard on the wind. As he stumbles on, he sees the Man in Red sitting under a tree, playing Tarot cards. Asking how it is going, Gino confesses that he has killed and that he is afraid for Francesca and afraid of Prosperos castle. The Man in Red gives Gino one of his cards as a sign. Gino takes it and returns to the castle. 
Meanwhile Alfredo is trying on the ape costume. Hop Toad directs him as how to walk slumped over and swinging his arms. He tells Alfredo that he can remove the costume once the unmasking is done. 
Gino finds a group of villagers heading for the castle to ask forgiveness and receive sanctuary. One woman is carried on a stretcher with the Red Death. Gino tries to stop them but is pushed aside. 
Juliana begins her ceremony, chanting at the altar. She drinks ceremonial wine drugged with hallucinogens. In the dreams she runs through hazy corridors and then finds herself on an altar. She is horrified to see five different men who wield weapons over her. 
When she comes to, she hears the laughter of Prospero and calls out to him. Searching from room to room, she tells him that she is now betrothed to the devil. He says there are more horrors to come. In the main room, she approaches the swinging pendulum and hears the voice of Prospero telling her that her fears have just begun. At this point she is attacked by one or more ravens that leave her dead and bloodied on the floor. 
One woman finds her and cries out. Prospero approaches with the other guests and tells the woman not to grieve for Juliana, for she has wed the devil. He calls for the masquerade to begin. 
Outside, the villagers arrive and call for mercy. They are told to return to Catania. One guard is sent to fetch Prospero. Gino tries to dissuade the elders from groveling before the Prince. They refuse. Prospero comes out and tells them to go back where they came. When they refuse, he commands his archers to slay them. 
Inside, Prospero throws jewels down to the people, who scramble to gather them. He tells Francesca that all of these rich people suffer from greed and are desperate for more riches. Then he tells them to rejoice because the remaining villagers are now dead. He has promised all inside his castle will be safe from the Red Death. He tells Francesca that soon she will be initiated into understanding. Prospero and Francesca are seen dancing with the others. 
Gino climbs the castle walls with a makeshift rope he has made from vines. At the battlement he sees the Man in Red, who tells him to wait until one oclock at which time Francesca will be sent out to him. Gino is anxious to rescue her but is told to be wise. When he is shown a dead guard, he looks back and the Man in Red has vanished. 
Hop Toad enters the room of Esmeralda and tells her to be ready to leave the castle later when he comes for her. She tells him that she trusts him. 
At the party, Hop Toad and the ape make their appearance. Hop Toad cracks his whip, telling everyone that he controls the ape. As the ape seizes a woman and falls to the floor with her, Hop Toad unties a rope holding up a light fixture of candles and lowers it just above them. Citing that the ape is out of control, Hop Toad ties him to the candle fixture and lifts him up in the air. Alfredo complains and demands to be released but Hop Toad tells him he has insulted Esmeralda too much and deserves to pay. Dousing the ape with brandy, Hop Toad sets him on fire. As the party goers look on, their laughter changes to screams as the ape burns. The fixture collapses and Prospero calls for the guards to remove it. Hop Toad leaves the room and Prospero calls for a reward to be given to him. 
Across the crowded dance floor, Prospero sees the Man in Red. Telling Francesca that he commanded that no one should wear red, he follows through the different rooms. In the black room, he is confronted by the Man in Red (whose face is covered). Prospero tries to guess who it is, saying the voice is familiar. Suspecting that it is the devil himself, he makes Francesca bow down. Prospero calls for the man to show his face but is told that he will only see it upon his own death. He tells Prospero that the unmasking will reveal everyones faces soon. 
Leaving the room, the Man in Red calls for a new dance to begin. Prospero follows. With each wave of his hands, the Man in Red spreads the Red Death to those at the party. Prospero is pleased and remarks that he led all these friends to Satan and corrupted them for him. He asks that Francesca be spared and the Man in Red tells her to go to the battlements. Prospero tells her that he will join her when this is over. 
Prospero addresses the Man in Red, who denies being the devil. He says that he is death. Prospero insists that his own pact with Satan will save him. The Man in Red says that it will not. Prospero removes the mask to see his face. He is horrified to see his own face, made red from the Red Death. Prospero is then taken by all the guests who jostle him around the room. As the people begin to collapse from the Red Death, Prospero is the only one left standing. He retreats to the black room, hoping to escape from a horrible death. In that room he finds the red-cloaked figure, who strikes him with the Red Death. 
The Man in Red is seen playing cards with the young girl from the village. Several other men arrive and give reports of the deaths of many. The Man in Red tells them that only six survived: one man and woman, a dwarf and small lady and the girl from the village.

                    John, Paul, George and Ringo - collectively known as The Beatles - leave their Liverpool home base to head to London where they are to perform on television. There, they have a few official engagements beforehand, such as rehearsals at the studio and a press conference, otherwise they are stuck at the hotel. In addition, they want some free time out just to be lads, which may be difficult seeing as to throngs of adoring and screaming primarily young female fans following them wherever they are known to be. They also encounter a few people who would rather not associate with them because of different sensibilities, a few people who, when seeing only one at a time, wonder if they are who they look to be, and a few people who mistake them for someone else. Sheltered Ringo, in particular, takes advantage of what little freedom they have, which may cause problems for them all in the end. Helping them navigate through all these issues but also ensuring they do their work as celebrities are two of their managers, Norm and Shake, who are accompanying them on this trip and who are having a disagreement about height. Also along for the ride is Paul's paternal grandfather, John McCartney, who Paul's mum believes needs an outing to nurse a broken heart. Despite his outwardly innocent appearance, McCartney Sr. ends up being a mischievous soul, whose misadventures they all have to get him out of time and time again. But at least McCartney Sr. is clean, ""very clean""...

"20","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058450/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Madame Emery and her daughter Geneviève (Deneuve) sell umbrellas at their little boutique in the coastal town of Cherbourg in Normandy, France. Geneviève is in love with Guy (Castelnuovo), a handsome young auto mechanic who lives with and cares for his sickly aunt and godmother Elise along with her quiet, dedicated, care-giver, Madeleine (Ellen Farner), a young woman who clearly loves Guy. Subsequently, though, Guy is drafted, and must leave to fight in the Algerian War.The night before he leaves, he and Geneviève make love. She becomes pregnant, and feels abandoned, as he does not write often. At her mother's insistence, she marries thirtyish Roland Cassard (Marc Michel), a quietly handsome Parisian jeweler who falls in love with Geneviève and is willing to wed her, even though she is carrying another man's child (Cassard had previously wooed the title character in Lola, only to be rejected once the father of her child returned; he relates an edited version of this story to Madame Emery with ill-concealed bitterness). The society wedding in a great cathedral shows Geneviève's upward social and economic movement, but she does not seem at all happy with her situation, and clearly feels trapped.When Guy returns with a leg injury, he learns that Geneviève has married and left Cherbourg, and that the umbrella store is gone. He attempts to ease back into his old life, but becomes rebellious due both to the war and to the loss of Geneviève. One day, Guy quits his job after an argument with his boss, and spends a night and a day drinking excessively in seedy port bars. He winds up sleeping with a prostitute named Jenny, whose real name turns out to be also Geneviève.When he returns to his apartment, Madeleine tells him tearfully that his godmother has died. He sees that Madeleine loves him, and cleans up his life with her encouragement. With an inheritance from his aunt, he is able to finance to own a new ""American-style"" Esso gas station. He asks Madeleine to marry him, and she accepts, though she wonders if he is asking her from despair at Geneviève's actions.The coda is set in December 1963, approximately five years after the earliest events. Guy is now managing the couple's Esso station. He's with his now upbeat and loving wife Madeleine and their little son François. It is Christmas Eve. Madeleine and François go for a short walk, leaving Guy briefly, after which a new Mercedes pulls in to the station. The mink-clad driver turns out to be a sophisticated, visibly wealthy Geneviève, accompanied by her (and Guy's) daughter Françoise, who remains in the car.At first shocked to see each other, they go inside the station to talk, and Geneviève explains this is the first time she has returned to Cherbourg since her marriage. Her fairly young mother is now dead. Her rich husband and child are the only family she has left. She has evidently had no children by Cassard, and she makes no mention of him. The two converse while Geneviève's car is being filled with gas, and Geneviève asks Guy if he wants to meet their daughter. Without comment, and little reflection, he answers ""no"", and this leads to their exchanging their final goodbyes. As the film ends, Guy greets his wife with a kiss and plays with his son.","
    
                    Told in four acts, the lives of Geneviève Emery and Guy Foucher of Cherbourg France are presented. Act 1 begins in November 1957, when sixteen year old Geneviève, who works in her widowed mother's umbrella shop called ""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"", and twenty year old Guy, who works as a mechanic at a gas station, are madly in love and want to get married. They are reluctant to tell anyone not only of their want to get married, but of their relationship. Geneviève believes her mother will think her too young, and would want her to marry someone with better prospects, especially considering her own tenuous financial situation. And Guy is more concerned now about not abandoning his ailing godmother, Aunt Élise, who raised him, and who he looks after along with a young woman named Madeleine. Act 2, told largely from Geneviève's perspective, begins in February 1958. Guy, drafted to fight for the French in Algeria, has been gone for two months, and is expected to be gone for two years. Geneviève rarely hears from Guy. In order to solve their many problems, Geneviève's mother wants her to marry Roland Cassard, a refined and well appointed diamond merchant who travels often for his work but who is devoted to Geneviève whenever he is in Cherbourg. Geneviève, who still loves Guy but who she is slowly losing in terms of him as a person in her mind, has to decide what to do about Roland, especially as it may become more difficult to accept his proposal as time progresses.

                    Geneviève, 17, lives with her widowed mother, who owns an umbrella shop in Cherbourg. She and Guy, a twenty-year-old auto mechanic, are secretly in love and want to marry, but when she reveals this to her mother, her mother objects on the grounds that Geneviève is too young and Guy is not mature or well-established enough, particularly since he has not yet done his required military service. Shortly after this, Guy is drafted to serve in the war in Algeria. Before he leaves, he and Geneviève consummate their love for each other, which results in her becoming pregnant. While Guy is away they drift apart, and Geneviève, strongly encouraged by her mother, accepts a marriage proposal from a well-to-do gem dealer named Roland Cassard, who has fallen in love with her at first sight and has promised to bring up her child as his own. (The character of Cassard is continued from Demy's earlier film Lola (1961).) Guy is wounded and is discharged before his two-year term is up, but when he returns to Cherbourg Geneviève has already married and moved away. He struggles with depression and anger, but eventually is healed by falling in love with and marrying Madeleine, a young woman who had been caring for his now-deceased aunt Élise. Using an inheritance from his aunt, Guy fulfills his ambition of opening a service station. Years later, the now conspicuously wealthy Geneviève, traveling with her daughter, Guy's child, accidentally meet Guy at his service station. While the two have only a brief conversation about the state of their respective lives, the conversation is clearly fraught with unspoken fondness and regret.

    Synopsis
    Madame Emery and her daughter Geneviève (Deneuve) sell umbrellas at their little boutique in the coastal town of Cherbourg in Normandy, France. Geneviève is in love with Guy (Castelnuovo), a handsome young auto mechanic who lives with and cares for his sickly aunt and godmother Elise along with her quiet, dedicated, care-giver, Madeleine (Ellen Farner), a young woman who clearly loves Guy. Subsequently, though, Guy is drafted, and must leave to fight in the Algerian War.The night before he leaves, he and Geneviève make love. She becomes pregnant, and feels abandoned, as he does not write often. At her mother's insistence, she marries thirtyish Roland Cassard (Marc Michel), a quietly handsome Parisian jeweler who falls in love with Geneviève and is willing to wed her, even though she is carrying another man's child (Cassard had previously wooed the title character in Lola, only to be rejected once the father of her child returned; he relates an edited version of this story to Madame Emery with ill-concealed bitterness). The society wedding in a great cathedral shows Geneviève's upward social and economic movement, but she does not seem at all happy with her situation, and clearly feels trapped.When Guy returns with a leg injury, he learns that Geneviève has married and left Cherbourg, and that the umbrella store is gone. He attempts to ease back into his old life, but becomes rebellious due both to the war and to the loss of Geneviève. One day, Guy quits his job after an argument with his boss, and spends a night and a day drinking excessively in seedy port bars. He winds up sleeping with a prostitute named Jenny, whose real name turns out to be also Geneviève.When he returns to his apartment, Madeleine tells him tearfully that his godmother has died. He sees that Madeleine loves him, and cleans up his life with her encouragement. With an inheritance from his aunt, he is able to finance to own a new ""American-style"" Esso gas station. He asks Madeleine to marry him, and she accepts, though she wonders if he is asking her from despair at Geneviève's actions.The coda is set in December 1963, approximately five years after the earliest events. Guy is now managing the couple's Esso station. He's with his now upbeat and loving wife Madeleine and their little son François. It is Christmas Eve. Madeleine and François go for a short walk, leaving Guy briefly, after which a new Mercedes pulls in to the station. The mink-clad driver turns out to be a sophisticated, visibly wealthy Geneviève, accompanied by her (and Guy's) daughter Françoise, who remains in the car.At first shocked to see each other, they go inside the station to talk, and Geneviève explains this is the first time she has returned to Cherbourg since her marriage. Her fairly young mother is now dead. Her rich husband and child are the only family she has left. She has evidently had no children by Cassard, and she makes no mention of him. The two converse while Geneviève's car is being filled with gas, and Geneviève asks Guy if he wants to meet their daughter. Without comment, and little reflection, he answers ""no"", and this leads to their exchanging their final goodbyes. As the film ends, Guy greets his wife with a kiss and plays with his son.

Jacques' nephew Robert (Christian Fuin) says he can organize it.Robert sets off the air raid siren at the station, and work lights are extinguished. Men scramble onto the train and spread paint. Robert is discovered and the lights turned on. Von Waldheim shoots him. The paint is discovered, and Didont is killed.In the morning, workers scraping the white paint are interrupted by an air raid. When the bombers pass harmlessly over the train, von Waldheim realizes the significance of the paint, and says, ""Leave it! Its my ticket to Germany."" He knows he can safely run the train in daylight.Up the line, Labiche plants an explosive charge under one rail. As the train approaches, he sees that von Waldheim has placed hostages on the locomotive. He is forced to blow the track well before the engine reaches it, giving the driver time to stop before only the first pilot wheel comes off the rail. Maj. Herren organizes the re-railing, and tells von Waldheim to send soldiers ahead to keep Labiche away from the tracks for the next few miles.Labiche struggles to get well ahead of the soldiers, and has just enough time to remove rail anchors and wedges along one rail length. Maj. Herren, riding the front of the engine, does not see the damage soon enough to stop the engine from coming off the rails. He tells von Waldheim it will now be impossible to continue.An army convoy passes by on the highway adjacent to the tracks. Von Waldheim steps into the road to stop the traffic, and orders the retreating soldiers to begin loading the paintings onto the trucks. The Major in charge of the convoy countermands von Waldheim's order, for the sake of his men. Maj. Herren convinces von Waldheim that they have lost. He and the others will join the convoy, but just before they leave, the sergeant signals a machine gunner to execute the hostages.Von Waldheim remains, alone. When the convoy has passed by, Labiche comes out of the bullrushes and finishes shutting down the engine. Then he sees the bodies of the hostages. He climbs off the engine, and is startled by von Waldheim, who claims such great art will always belong to people who can appreciate it. Labiche looks to the dead hostages and guns him down. As he walks away, the abandoned crates of art lie askew, juxtaposed with the crumpled bodies of the numerous dead.","

The French resistance however wants to stop them from stealing their national treasures but have received orders from London that they are not to be destroyed. The station master, Labiche, is tasked with scheduling the train and making it all happen smoothly but he is also part of a dwindling group of resistance fighters tasked with preventing the theft.

                    During WWII, the Nazis have stolen many priceless works of art, planning to destroy those they deem against their sensibilities. German Colonel Franz von Waldheim, however, is an art aficionado and as such, against the wants of the Germans in general, decides in August 1944, days before it looks like France will be liberated, to bring back to Germany many of those priceless works of art from the Jeu de Paume in Paris. von Waldheim will go to any length to achieve this largely personal mission, which he plans to accomplish by transporting the art packed in crates via rail. Mlle. Villard, the curator of the gallery, asks the Resistance to stop von Waldheim. Paul Labiche, a railway inspector and one of the leaders of the Resistance, initially does not want to assist Mlle. Villard, seeing the lives of the Resistance members and the larger goals of French freedom as more important. But based on incidents, Labiche changes his mind and assists in the mission, he who ends up having an up close and personal vantage point. Labiche's elaborate plan has many obstacles to overcome to achieve success, including von Waldheim's own success at any cost mentality.

    Synopsis
    Nazi Colonel Franz von Waldheim (Paul Scofield) and museum curator Mlle.Villard (Suzanne Flon) are admiring Impressionist and Modernist paintings in the Jeu de Paume, in Paris. She thanks him for protecting the art, but he announces that many of them are now going to be taken to Germany.Col. von Waldheim goes to the headquarters of General von Lubitz (Richard Munch), which is bustling with staff packing or destroying records and organizing the withdrawal from Paris. Von Lubitz considers the cargo ""degenerate art,"" but Col. von Waldheim succeeds in getting authorization for a train to transport the art by pointing out that the paintings are ""as negotiable as gold, and more valuable.""Railway Superintendent Paul Labiche (Burt Lancaster) meets in a river barge with Spinet (Paul Bonifas) to receive the latest instructions from London for the railwaymen working for the Resistance. His last two remaining compatriots are also there: Didont (Albert Rémy) and Pesquet (Charles Millot). Spinet tells them they are asked to delay departure of an armament train by ten minutes so that it will be caught in the saturation bombing of the yard at Vaires at 10:00 o'clock.Then he introduces another request.

Shannon lost his church and was defrocked after taking liberties with one of his parishioners.

After Charlotte and Shannon spend the night together, Fellowes is out to have him fired and to keep her from communicating with his employer, Shannon strands them at a remote hotel run by his good friend Maxine Faulk. It's the arrival of Hannah Jelkes and her elderly grandfather that has the greatest impact however. Her approach to life and love forces Shannon to deal with his demons and re-evaluate his life.

There he becomes a tour guide for a bus load of spinsters and a teenage nymphet named Charlotte Goodall, who is being chaperoned by the group's leader, the inflexible Judith Fellowes. Miss Fellowes, who is quite jealous of Charlotte's attentions to Shannon, discovers the young woman in his room and vows to have him fired. To thwart her plot, Shannon takes control of the bus from Hank, the bus driver, and speeds the tour group on a wild ride through the Mexican jungle to the crumbling, secluded hotel of an old friend, the recently widowed Maxine Falk. Eventually Shannon becomes enamored with another guest at the hotel, the rather genteel Hanna Jelkes, an itinerant quick sketch artist and her poet grandfather Nonno. As the wise Hanna partially restores Shannon's fractured world, Shannon struggles to get back the rest of his sanity and his self-respect.

    Synopsis
    In a small European town, an old castle was once inhabited by three sisters. No, there was nothing normal about them, for they were The Gorgons. The most infamous was Medusa until her head of snake laden hair was cut off. Fear has swallowed the town because they believe that either Euryale or Medera,
still live there. Dr. Namaroff (Peter Cushing) is the first to discover the awful truth as the immortal Gorgon has taken a human form. The human that she posses is Carla, Namaroff's assistant. She does not know what is happening to her due to the fact that she blacksout when the Gorgon takes her over. She and her love interest Paul believe that the Dr. is lying because he is jealous. As the number of murders mount, the two men fight. Finally the awful truth is discovered and Paul and the Dr. fall victim to The Gorgan's power and are turned to stone. The only one left who knows the secret of her power is Prof. Meister (Christopher Lee). It is up to him to take her head and break the curse forever or to fail and doom more of the townspeople. He takes his sword and finds the evil beast from ancient mythology, and luckily a mirror in her castle.

                    A series of human and computer errors sends a squadron of American 'Vindicator' bombers to nuke Moscow. The President, in order to convince the Soviets that this is a mistake, orders the Strategic Air Command to help the Soviets stop them.

                    When the United States Air Force's elaborate fail-safe systems fail, a squadron of nuclear-armed bombers crosses the Bering Strait into the USSR to attack. No one is quite sure why it happened but it's left to the President of the United States to try and find a solution with his Soviet counterpart. For some, like political scientist Professor Groetschele, the situation presents opportunities. He argues that they should not dwell on the morality of the attack and simply accept that it has happened. On that basis, he argues in favor of an all-out nuclear attack against the Soviet Union as the only sure way to ensure the survival of American culture and beliefs. The President sees it differently and works with the Soviets to stop the American bombers before they reach their target. When that fails, the President sees only one possible way to prevent global thermo-nuclear war.

At this point the flight crew are trained to cease communications and prepare to fulfill their objective by bombing Moscow.

And all of these men become enveloped in the ultimate accident; when a malfunction damages SAC's fault indicator, the system is changed routinely, but it causes a malfunction in the mainframe that launches Jack Grady's squadron on an attack mission to obliterate Moscow. When the full horror of the accidental attack order becomes clear, SAC and the President must work to recall or stop the bombers, but all efforts are frustrated by the skill and working orders of the pilots involved as well as the power of their planes, and when they penetrate Soviet airspace a running sky battle erupts. But the bombers press on, and through negotiations with the Soviet premier, the President is left with but one hope of averting Armageddon, an order so audacious it even shocks the Soviet premier and leaves the President's subalters speechless.

The general has been having a recurrent dream - that of a matador killing a bull - which he believes is some sort of omen relating to his job. Through a series of mechanical, technical and human errors, American bombers are deployed to investigate a potential air threat. Although the threat was non-existent, the bombers, through these errors, are ultimately sent to bomb Moscow. Because of counter-measures designed to protect orders, the bombers cannot be recalled. In addition to negotiations with the Soviet Premier, the President requests the advice of those in the War Room on what to do, the individuals there having differing opinions. But the President will make his decisions based on that advice and his discussions with the Premier. But those in mission control in Omaha, who are removed from the discussion process but are charged with carrying out the orders, may have some issue with the President's orders since they are based on discussions with the ""enemy"".

"31","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058576/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","(Monday, 12 May) The United States is in a state very close to turmoil. Strikes threaten to shut down the entire coal industry--and on Pennsylvania Avenue (still open in front of the White House in the film setting), two opposing forces of demonstrators meet, first in stony silence, then with taunts shouted back and forth. One side carries signs offering thanks to President Jordan Lyman (Fredric March) for signing a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. (""Peace On Earth Or No Earth At All"" says a double-wide banner.) The other carries bellicose signs denouncing Lyman and the treaty, and promoting the possible Presidential candidacy of a four-star Air Force general: James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Then a Scott fan swings his sign to cut the double-wide banner. Result: mélée, to which the Capitol Police respond at once with cruisers, motorcycles, and paddy wagons.Inside the White House, the President's physician (Malcolm Atterbury) notes that Lyman's blood pressure climbs by three millimeters of mercury for every letter he dictates. Aide Paul Girard (Martin Balsam) reluctantly shares with Lyman a Gallup Poll result showing that only 29 percent of the American people approve of the treaty. To the desperate pleas of the physician that he take two weeks off, Lyman says that he will take a swim in the White House swimming pool.Lyman asks Senator Raymond Clark, D-Ga. (Edmund O'Brien) to join him. Lyman has two things to tell Clark. One is his rationale for the treaty: that absent that treaty, the hair-trigger status quo would only get worse, and inevitably some hatred-crazed officer, on either side, might initiate a full nuclear strike, maybe with authorization, possibly without, and the resulting war would end in Pyrrhic victory. The other is some advice to Clark: lay off the sauce. Ray Clark is, quite simply, an alcoholic.Clark takes his leave of the President and returns to Capitol Hill and a meeting of the Senate Committee on the Armed Services. (Today such a meeting would take place in the Russell Senate Office Building.) General Scott is the key witness. He insists that the treaty is ""at best, an act of naïveté, and at worst an unsupportable negligence."" Senator Frederick Prentice, R-Calif. (Whit Bissell), the chairman, is inclined to sympathize and to throw softball questions at Scott. Clark ridicules the proceedings (""a bad Gilbert and Sullivan"") and frequently spars with his chairman and with Scott. Very clearly, Scott cannot persuade anyone who does not already agree with him.Scott does enjoy the almost unquestioning devotion of his senior administrative assistant, Colonel Martin ""Jiggs"" Casey, USMC (Kirk Douglas). As the two men make their way out of the Russell Building to Constitution Avenue for a drive back to the Pentagon, Scott instructs Casey that no one on Capitol Hill, or in the press, is to know about an alert planned for the upcoming Sunday (18 May). ""This one must be deep and dark,"" he says.Back at the Pentagon, Casey checks into the E-ring and goes to the office complex of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There he chats with a young officer in All-service Radio, Lt. (jg) Dorsey Grayson USN (Jack Mullaney). Grayson gives Casey some gossip: that General Scott has sent a message to ""nothing but the cream"", asking them to place their bets for the upcoming Preakness race. The recipients are: the commander of Vandenberg AFB; commander, SAC (Omaha, NE); ComSixthFleet (Gibraltar); Commander-in-chief, Pacific Theater; and commander, First Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, NC. The only man to send in a no-bet message: Vice-Admiral Farley C. Barnswell USN (John Houseman), ComSixthFleet.Casey goes on to his office, where he next meets Colonel William ""Mutt"" Henderson USA (Andrew Duggan), a member of the Army's Signal Corps. Henderson tells Casey that he is exec of EComCon, a secret unit based at a ""Site Y"" near El Paso, TX. Casey has never heard of EComCon, but draws Henderson out. Henderson reveals that his commanding officer is Colonel John Broderick USA (John Larkin), an officer that Casey has always regarded with suspicion of harboring neo-Nazi attitudes, particularly toward what an army ought to be. Henderson also reveals that EComCon has 100 officers and 3600 enlistees--and has been training more often for seizure than for prevention, as if the assets that EComCon is tasked to guard are already in enemy hands, and EComCon has to repossess them.General Scott's aide-de-camp, Colonel Murdock (Richard Anderson), interrupts the two by sending Henderson to another office. He then tells Casey that he should not discuss the alert with Henderson. Casey then, on a wild hunch, starts trying to draw out Murdock on Scott's Preakness pool. To his surprise, Murdock becomes terrifically angry and lets Casey know, in no uncertain terms, that he ought not to stick his nose into ""the General's personal business!"" As soon as Murdock leaves, Casey calls the Pentagon operator and asks whether she has a listing for EComCon. The answer: negative.That night, Casey goes to a party at the home of Stewart Dillard (Charles Watts). There he has a run-in with Girard, who protests Scott's belligerent appearance before SASC earlier that day. Senator Prentice butts in, taunts Girard over the treaty, then tries to goad Casey into talking out-of-school about what the military thinks of the treaty. This Casey will not do. Before things get seriously out-of-control, Dillard shows up and escorts Girard to meet ""the wife of the Indian Ambassador.""To Casey's immense relief, the next guest to speak to him has more pleasant things to say. This is Eleanor Holbrook (Ava Gardner), who until recently has been General Scott's squeeze. Now he has apparently dumped her, and she is trying to drown her sorrows in booze, a thing that Casey tries to put a stop to. Casey then agrees to see Ellie on a social basis.But before Casey can keep the nightcap date, Prentice, clearly not through, button-holes Casey and shoots his mouth off: ""We all have to stay on the alert, especially on Sunday."" Casey cannot let that rest. He apologizes profusely to Ellie, then sets out for Fort Myer, General Scott's headquarters. What to his wondering eyes should appear but Senator Prentice' automobile, parked outside of General Scott's official residence, and Senator Prentice getting out of his car and letting an orderly escort him into the residence--at 2345 hours.(Tuesday 13 May) The next morning, Casey reports to work, to review some footage from the last all-service alert, run in January. Scott is clearly not satisfied, saying that the military's response is way too slow. He then asks Casey to ""stay close"" and be available after the JCS meeting. Casey notices that Scott is tired, and asks Scott whether he got to bed late. Scott answers that he ""went to bed too early, slept from eight to eight, too much sleep. I may never wake up."" Clearly, that's a lie.After the meeting, Casey notes that the Chief of Staff of the Navy was not present at the meeting. He idly picks up a crumpled piece of paper from the desk of General Hardesty (Tyler McVey), Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The note reads: ""Airlift EComCon 40 K212s to Site Y before 0700 Sunday. Chi, New York, LA, Utah."" (The K-212 is a fictitious troop transport; no such aircraft exists on the military aircraft catalogue.) Scott tells Casey to keep secret the Preakness pool and Admiral Barnswell's refusal to participate. He then asks Casey to watch the broadcast from tonight's convention of the American Veterans' Order, which Scott will address.Grayson flags Casey on his way out, saying that he has just received a transfer to Pearl Harbor. He also reveals that Admiral Barnswell was indeed the only man to ""poop out on the General's racing form.""Casey does watch the AVO convention. Commentator Harold McPherson (Hugh Marlowe) introduces Scott, who addresses the meeting after the fashion of a politician, not a military officer. Casey has now seen enough. He calls the operator and asks for a connection to the White House.Casey goes to the White House and lays out everything before the President: EComCon (which, if it is a formal military abbreviation, could stand for Emergency Communications Control), its size, its ostensible mission, its probable mission (""training for seizure""), the Hardesty Note, the Preakness pool (and shipping Lt.-jg Grayson off to Hawaii when he revealed too much), Senator Prentice shooting his mouth off, Scott receiving Prentice late at night and then lying about how soon he went to bed that night, and finally that Congress is in recess, the Vice-President is on a goodwill tour of Italy, and the President has been asked to participate in the alert without the press. The upshot: General Scott is orchestrating a plot to take over the government. D-Day: Sunday, 18 May.Girard is not inclined to believe Casey. Girard also telephones Bill Condon at the Bureau of the Budget (after Casey leaves), and from him learns that no authority has ever appropriated funds for anything like EComCon. But the President will not discount the story. Hastily he assembles a task force, consisting of Girard, Supervisor Art Corwin (Bart Burns) of the Secret Service, Secretary of the Treasury Chris Todd (George Macready), Senator Raymond Clark, and Col. Jiggs Casey.(Wednesday 14 May) Chris Todd flatly does not believe in the plot, citing the absence of evidence for EComCon. Girard is inclined to agree with him. But the President cites the Navy being left out of the JCS meeting, the Hardesty Note, and what 3600 troops, aboard 40 K212 transports, could do. Art furthermore reveals Col. Broderick's Nazi-like attitudes, and Clark especially fears Scott's politician's manner.Finally, the President calls a halt to any further discussion. He lays out specific assignments. Chris Todd will coordinate at the White House. Art will recruit as many Secret Service agents as he needs to run tails on Generals Scott; Hardesty; Riley (William Challee), commandant of Marines; and Diefenbach (Robert Brubaker), chief of staff of the Army. Paul Girard will take a letter from the President to Gibraltar, confront Admiral Barnswell with it, and get his written reply. Ray Clark will go to El Paso, take a telephone number that Casey got from Col. Henderson, and ""find that base."" Casey will stay close to Scott and try to gather more information from him.Scott catches Casey looking up El Paso on the map. Whether Scott suspects Casey of compromising him, the film does not make clear--but Scott peremptorily gives Casey a seventy-two-hour leave.At Dulles Airport, Casey sees Clark off, but not before Clark instructs Casey to go see Ellie Holbrook, who might know more about Scott than anyone. As Casey prepares to leave with Art Corwin, they spot Harold MacPherson getting into a staff car belonging to Scott. The two men trail this car to a back alley, where apparently McPherson has met with Senator Prentice.(Thursday 15 May) President Lyman cancels all his appointments for the day. He also telephones Scott to tell him that he won't participate in the alert after all, but will go to his private island retreat on Blue Lake, Maine. (This is not the official Presidential retreat at Camp David; this is Jordan Lyman's private property.) Scott tells his secretary to hold his calls, while he calls Colonel Broderick at Site Y.Ray Clark makes it to El Paso an strikes up a conversation with a girl (Colette Jackson), who wonders why no soldiers have patronized the bar, though a base must be located nearby, as she and the bar owner see and hear planes flying in and out of a remote area at all hours. Clark gets into his automobile and drives down a desert road, and takes a turn-off. Then a helicopter drops out of the sky, and out steps a stone-faced guard, gun drawn, to arrest Clark.Paul Girard has made it to Gibraltar, and meets with Barnswell aboard his flagship (USS Kitty Hawk, CVAN 63). Barnswell breaks into a sweat, then agrees to write a detailed confession.Jiggs Casey goes to see Ellie Holbrook at her home. From her he gets a detailed and lurid story of her affair with Scott--in which Scott was so supremely sure of himself that he would write letters to her describing all the details of their relationship, none of which are safe for work. Casey then stuns and hurts Ellie by taking possession of the letters. Because he cannot tell her why he needs the letters, she assumes, incorrectly, that he came to collect them to spare Scott any embarrassment.(Friday 16 May) President Lyman screens some very damning footage shot from Blue Lake. Shown is a runabout reconnoitering the private island. In that runabout: Colonels Murdock and Broderick. That alone convinces Lyman, and Todd, that Scott and the others are indeed guilty.Todd heaps fulsome praise on Casey for securing Scott's lurid love letters. Casey makes no effort to hide his monumental distaste, and lets Todd know that he does not appreciate the inference. Lyman stops the nasty argument and assures Casey that, thanks to Paul Girard securing a written confession from Barnswell, he, Lyman, won't have to use the letters. But then Presidential secretary Esther Townsend (Helen Kleeb) brings in a dire message: Paul Girard is dead, killed in a crash of the airliner he was on. (The airline's name is ""Trans-Ocean Airlines,"" but is probably TWA, given the era of the film's release.)Ray Clark, now detained at Site Y, bellows into a telephone to Senator Prentice that he will demand several explanations from him the next time he sees him. Colonel Broderick, now back from his errand to Blue Lake, tells Clark that he's not going anywhere for awhile, and leaves him a bottle of booze. Clark pours this down a sink drain after reading a newspaper account of Girard's death.Henry Whitney (Fredd Wayne), an attaché at the US Embassy in Madrid, visits the crash site looking for the personal effects of Girard and the one other listed American passenger.Back on Site Y, late at night, Colonel Henderson visits Clark in his locked room. Clark then tells Henderson that when he, Henderson, first told Jiggs Casey about EComCon, Jiggs had never heard of it. Jiggs then looked up EComCon and found no reference to it in JCS orders. Henderson sits down to listen as Clark tells him ""the d____dest story you ever heard."" Whereupon Henderson decides to take Clark off the base. He tries to go non-violently, but when a sergeant detains him near the base flight line, and the alarm sounds, Henderson decks the sergeant, drives over the barrier berm, and escapes with Clark.(Saturday 17 May) Henderson and Clark arrive at Dulles Airport. But when Clark calls the White House to report in, someone takes Henderson away as if Henderson never existed. The President later confirms that someone has seen Henderson driven into Fort Myer and confined to the stockade--incommunicado.The President calls Barnswell to try to trick him into an incriminating statement. The savvy Barnswell denies ever signing anything or handing anything to Girard.Chris Todd urges the President to arrest Scott, Hardesty, Riley, and Diefenbach right now. Lyman will not do this without evidence. Ray Clark urges Lyman to use the Scott Letters, but Lyman won't make up his mind to do that, either.Then Scott's plan begins to unravel. Scott is rehearsing the communications cutouts at Mount Thunder, when an aide tells him that General Barney Rutkowski (Ferris Webster) has gotten his wind up after ten of the K212 transports crossed his radar and then flew under it. The aid is afraid that the by-the-book Rutkowski will go straight to the President with what he knows.That is exactly what Rutkowski does. ""Someone has a secret base near El Paso, and I should have been notified!"" says the angry Rutkowski. He then says that thirty more transports were due to fly in the same general direction by 0700 Sunday--only now they're due by 2300 that night. The President orders Rutkowski to ground any aircraft going anywhere near El Paso, or flying out of it.Now Lyman summons Scott to the White House. At a late-night meeting, with no witnesses, Lyman confronts Scott with everything he knows: EComCon, the detention of Senator Clark, the collusion between Senator Prentice and Colonel Broderick, the very selection of Broderick (considering his attitudes), Broderick's reconnaissance of Lyman's Blue Lake island, the arrest-without-charge of Colonel Henderson, and the Preakness code. Then the two men debate one another's moral position. Scott insists that he could be elected by acclimation whenever he asked. Lyman stands on the Constitution, elections, and the very real possibility that the Soviets would attack at once upon sensing that the United States was falling to a military dictator. In the end, Lyman demands Scott's resignation, and those of Hardesty, Riley and Diefenbach, and says that he will announce that demand in a press conference the following afternoon.Scott passes Casey on his way out and leaves without a word. Lyman then comes out of the Oval Office, hands the Scott Letters to Casey, and tells them to give them back to Ellie.(Sunday 18 May) Scott's plans have gone more than a trifle awry. Obviously, the EComCon Airlift did *not* take place as planned. So Scott plans to tape a delayed broadcast ""to take his case to the people."" Hardesty, Riley and Diefenbach are highly dubious by this time, but Scott presses on.President Lyman begins his press conference, pre-empting the Preakness Race to do it. Then he delays it for half an hour, when Henry Whitney shows up--with the Barnswell statement, which Whitney did manage to recover from the wreckage of Paul Girard's doomed flight. (Girard had hidden it in a cigarette case that Lyman had given him as a special gift.) After ordering Whitney to keep the paper secret, Lyman has it copied out.Casey goes to the E-Ring to hand-deliver a copy of the Barnswell statement to Scott, together with Lyman's written demand for Scott's resignation. Scott accuses Casey of betraying him, and Casey accuses Scott of betraying his country and ""disgrac[ing] the four stars on his uniform.""Scott goes to a TV station to record his belligerent message. But before he can begin, a panicked Prentice and McPherson inform him that the President has a signed statement giving names and dates and implicating them all. Scott contemptuously dismisses the two men and returns to the E-Ring--where he overhears Lyman accepting the resignations of Hardesty, Riley and Diefenbach. Now utterly defeated, he gets back into his staff car and orders his driver to take him ""home.""Casey goes to see Ellie, who knows perfectly well why Casey took the Scott Letters. As he hands them back to her, she accepts Casey's word that the letters ""might have been"" ""the bullets"" to ""[shoot down]"" Scott, but weren't. The two agree to see each other again, after the excitement has died down.Lastly, Lyman declares that it is ""slander"" to suggest that the United States cannot be strong without directly waging war. He insists that world peace, and freedom, will come peaceably. With that, and a display of the Constitution, the film ends.","
    
                    An unpopular U.S. President manages to get a nuclear disarmament treaty through the Senate, but finds that the nation is turning against him. Jiggs Casey, a Marine Colonel, finds evidence that General Scott, the wildly popular head of the Joint Chiefs and certain Presidential Candidate in 2 years is not planning to wait. Casey goes to the president with the information and a web of intrigue begins with each side unsure of who can be trusted.

                    At the height of the cold war, a weakened President and a popular four-star general face off in a battle for control of the US government. President Jordan Lyman has successfully negotiated an arms reduction treaty with the Soviet Union, but his measure is unpopular and does not sit well with General James Mattoon Scott, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has been quite vocal in his opposition. Marine Corps Col. Jiggs Casey, who works for Scott, comes to the conclusion that senior military officers are plotting a coup to overthrow the government. Working with a small circle of reliable and loyal officials, President Lyman tries to get the evidence of Scott's treachery and stop him.

                    US President Jordan Lyman is a polarizing figure, with more opposing his actions than supporting them. The reason?: he signed a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. His detractors believe the Soviets will not live up to their end of the treaty and thus leave the US unprotected. They don't believe true peace can be an outcome of the Cold War. One of those detractors is Air Force General James Mattoon Scott, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Scott is slowly ingratiating himself as a political figure - the face of US security - to raise the fervor of the peace naysayers. Marine Colonel Martin Casey - Jiggs to his friends - Director of the Joint Chiefs who works directly under Scott and who is loyal to him and his anti-treaty views, comes into a quick succession of seemingly innocent and not so innocent information - build up of a new military base in Texas dealing with Ecomcon which he previously knew nothing of, Scott secretly organizing $10 bets from other US military leaders on a horse race at the Preakness, anti-treaty Senator Frederick Prentice stating to him in private that they must all stay alert on Sunday, and Scott lying about his previous night's activities - which in combination makes him believe that Scott is leading a military coup against the president. Ecomcon seems to be shorthand for ""Emergency Communication Control"" and the taking of those $10 bets signifies support for the coup to happen in seven days on that upcoming Sunday during a covert military training exercise in the form of an all out alert about which Prentice should have known nothing. Jiggs brings his concerns to the President, who in turn cautiously takes the information with seriousness. With Jiggs, his chief aide Paul Girard, and his dearest friend, senior Senator Raymond Clark (who is better known as a dipsomaniac than an effective politician) among others, Lyman tries to amass evidence of the conspiracy, that evidence which includes dirt on Scott's private life from his former mistress, Ellie Holbrook, to be used only if all other avenues fail. They do learn that the conspiracy is true, but that it is so widespread - its scope including at least one in the media, political commentator Harold McPherson - that obtaining evidence is difficult. Without it, Lyman, as an unpopular president, will lose total effectiveness as a leader if he requests Scott's resignation. The race to Sunday begins as both sides try to protect their ideal of what's best for the country.

    Synopsis
    (Monday, 12 May) The United States is in a state very close to turmoil. Strikes threaten to shut down the entire coal industry--and on Pennsylvania Avenue (still open in front of the White House in the film setting), two opposing forces of demonstrators meet, first in stony silence, then with taunts shouted back and forth. One side carries signs offering thanks to President Jordan Lyman (Fredric March) for signing a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. (""Peace On Earth Or No Earth At All"" says a double-wide banner.) The other carries bellicose signs denouncing Lyman and the treaty, and promoting the possible Presidential candidacy of a four-star Air Force general: James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Then a Scott fan swings his sign to cut the double-wide banner. Result: mélée, to which the Capitol Police respond at once with cruisers, motorcycles, and paddy wagons.Inside the White House, the President's physician (Malcolm Atterbury) notes that Lyman's blood pressure climbs by three millimeters of mercury for every letter he dictates. Aide Paul Girard (Martin Balsam) reluctantly shares with Lyman a Gallup Poll result showing that only 29 percent of the American people approve of the treaty. To the desperate pleas of the physician that he take two weeks off, Lyman says that he will take a swim in the White House swimming pool.Lyman asks Senator Raymond Clark, D-Ga. (Edmund O'Brien) to join him. Lyman has two things to tell Clark. One is his rationale for the treaty: that absent that treaty, the hair-trigger status quo would only get worse, and inevitably some hatred-crazed officer, on either side, might initiate a full nuclear strike, maybe with authorization, possibly without, and the resulting war would end in Pyrrhic victory. The other is some advice to Clark: lay off the sauce. Ray Clark is, quite simply, an alcoholic.Clark takes his leave of the President and returns to Capitol Hill and a meeting of the Senate Committee on the Armed Services. (Today such a meeting would take place in the Russell Senate Office Building.) General Scott is the key witness. He insists that the treaty is ""at best, an act of naïveté, and at worst an unsupportable negligence."" Senator Frederick Prentice, R-Calif. (Whit Bissell), the chairman, is inclined to sympathize and to throw softball questions at Scott. Clark ridicules the proceedings (""a bad Gilbert and Sullivan"") and frequently spars with his chairman and with Scott. Very clearly, Scott cannot persuade anyone who does not already agree with him.Scott does enjoy the almost unquestioning devotion of his senior administrative assistant, Colonel Martin ""Jiggs"" Casey, USMC (Kirk Douglas). As the two men make their way out of the Russell Building to Constitution Avenue for a drive back to the Pentagon, Scott instructs Casey that no one on Capitol Hill, or in the press, is to know about an alert planned for the upcoming Sunday (18 May). ""This one must be deep and dark,"" he says.Back at the Pentagon, Casey checks into the E-ring and goes to the office complex of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There he chats with a young officer in All-service Radio, Lt. (jg) Dorsey Grayson USN (Jack Mullaney). Grayson gives Casey some gossip: that General Scott has sent a message to ""nothing but the cream"", asking them to place their bets for the upcoming Preakness race. The recipients are: the commander of Vandenberg AFB; commander, SAC (Omaha, NE); ComSixthFleet (Gibraltar); Commander-in-chief, Pacific Theater; and commander, First Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, NC. The only man to send in a no-bet message: Vice-Admiral Farley C. Barnswell USN (John Houseman), ComSixthFleet.Casey goes on to his office, where he next meets Colonel William ""Mutt"" Henderson USA (Andrew Duggan), a member of the Army's Signal Corps. Henderson tells Casey that he is exec of EComCon, a secret unit based at a ""Site Y"" near El Paso, TX. Casey has never heard of EComCon, but draws Henderson out. Henderson reveals that his commanding officer is Colonel John Broderick USA (John Larkin), an officer that Casey has always regarded with suspicion of harboring neo-Nazi attitudes, particularly toward what an army ought to be. Henderson also reveals that EComCon has 100 officers and 3600 enlistees--and has been training more often for seizure than for prevention, as if the assets that EComCon is tasked to guard are already in enemy hands, and EComCon has to repossess them.General Scott's aide-de-camp, Colonel Murdock (Richard Anderson), interrupts the two by sending Henderson to another office. He then tells Casey that he should not discuss the alert with Henderson. Casey then, on a wild hunch, starts trying to draw out Murdock on Scott's Preakness pool. To his surprise, Murdock becomes terrifically angry and lets Casey know, in no uncertain terms, that he ought not to stick his nose into ""the General's personal business!"" As soon as Murdock leaves, Casey calls the Pentagon operator and asks whether she has a listing for EComCon. The answer: negative.That night, Casey goes to a party at the home of Stewart Dillard (Charles Watts). There he has a run-in with Girard, who protests Scott's belligerent appearance before SASC earlier that day. Senator Prentice butts in, taunts Girard over the treaty, then tries to goad Casey into talking out-of-school about what the military thinks of the treaty. This Casey will not do. Before things get seriously out-of-control, Dillard shows up and escorts Girard to meet ""the wife of the Indian Ambassador.""To Casey's immense relief, the next guest to speak to him has more pleasant things to say. This is Eleanor Holbrook (Ava Gardner), who until recently has been General Scott's squeeze. Now he has apparently dumped her, and she is trying to drown her sorrows in booze, a thing that Casey tries to put a stop to. Casey then agrees to see Ellie on a social basis.But before Casey can keep the nightcap date, Prentice, clearly not through, button-holes Casey and shoots his mouth off: ""We all have to stay on the alert, especially on Sunday."" Casey cannot let that rest. He apologizes profusely to Ellie, then sets out for Fort Myer, General Scott's headquarters. What to his wondering eyes should appear but Senator Prentice' automobile, parked outside of General Scott's official residence, and Senator Prentice getting out of his car and letting an orderly escort him into the residence--at 2345 hours.(Tuesday 13 May) The next morning, Casey reports to work, to review some footage from the last all-service alert, run in January. Scott is clearly not satisfied, saying that the military's response is way too slow. He then asks Casey to ""stay close"" and be available after the JCS meeting. Casey notices that Scott is tired, and asks Scott whether he got to bed late. Scott answers that he ""went to bed too early, slept from eight to eight, too much sleep. I may never wake up."" Clearly, that's a lie.After the meeting, Casey notes that the Chief of Staff of the Navy was not present at the meeting. He idly picks up a crumpled piece of paper from the desk of General Hardesty (Tyler McVey), Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The note reads: ""Airlift EComCon 40 K212s to Site Y before 0700 Sunday. Chi, New York, LA, Utah."" (The K-212 is a fictitious troop transport; no such aircraft exists on the military aircraft catalogue.) Scott tells Casey to keep secret the Preakness pool and Admiral Barnswell's refusal to participate. He then asks Casey to watch the broadcast from tonight's convention of the American Veterans' Order, which Scott will address.Grayson flags Casey on his way out, saying that he has just received a transfer to Pearl Harbor. He also reveals that Admiral Barnswell was indeed the only man to ""poop out on the General's racing form.""Casey does watch the AVO convention. Commentator Harold McPherson (Hugh Marlowe) introduces Scott, who addresses the meeting after the fashion of a politician, not a military officer. Casey has now seen enough. He calls the operator and asks for a connection to the White House.Casey goes to the White House and lays out everything before the President: EComCon (which, if it is a formal military abbreviation, could stand for Emergency Communications Control), its size, its ostensible mission, its probable mission (""training for seizure""), the Hardesty Note, the Preakness pool (and shipping Lt.-jg Grayson off to Hawaii when he revealed too much), Senator Prentice shooting his mouth off, Scott receiving Prentice late at night and then lying about how soon he went to bed that night, and finally that Congress is in recess, the Vice-President is on a goodwill tour of Italy, and the President has been asked to participate in the alert without the press. The upshot: General Scott is orchestrating a plot to take over the government. D-Day: Sunday, 18 May.Girard is not inclined to believe Casey. Girard also telephones Bill Condon at the Bureau of the Budget (after Casey leaves), and from him learns that no authority has ever appropriated funds for anything like EComCon. But the President will not discount the story. Hastily he assembles a task force, consisting of Girard, Supervisor Art Corwin (Bart Burns) of the Secret Service, Secretary of the Treasury Chris Todd (George Macready), Senator Raymond Clark, and Col. Jiggs Casey.(Wednesday 14 May) Chris Todd flatly does not believe in the plot, citing the absence of evidence for EComCon. Girard is inclined to agree with him. But the President cites the Navy being left out of the JCS meeting, the Hardesty Note, and what 3600 troops, aboard 40 K212 transports, could do. Art furthermore reveals Col. Broderick's Nazi-like attitudes, and Clark especially fears Scott's politician's manner.Finally, the President calls a halt to any further discussion. He lays out specific assignments. Chris Todd will coordinate at the White House. Art will recruit as many Secret Service agents as he needs to run tails on Generals Scott; Hardesty; Riley (William Challee), commandant of Marines; and Diefenbach (Robert Brubaker), chief of staff of the Army. Paul Girard will take a letter from the President to Gibraltar, confront Admiral Barnswell with it, and get his written reply. Ray Clark will go to El Paso, take a telephone number that Casey got from Col. Henderson, and ""find that base."" Casey will stay close to Scott and try to gather more information from him.Scott catches Casey looking up El Paso on the map. Whether Scott suspects Casey of compromising him, the film does not make clear--but Scott peremptorily gives Casey a seventy-two-hour leave.At Dulles Airport, Casey sees Clark off, but not before Clark instructs Casey to go see Ellie Holbrook, who might know more about Scott than anyone. As Casey prepares to leave with Art Corwin, they spot Harold MacPherson getting into a staff car belonging to Scott. The two men trail this car to a back alley, where apparently McPherson has met with Senator Prentice.(Thursday 15 May) President Lyman cancels all his appointments for the day. He also telephones Scott to tell him that he won't participate in the alert after all, but will go to his private island retreat on Blue Lake, Maine. (This is not the official Presidential retreat at Camp David; this is Jordan Lyman's private property.) Scott tells his secretary to hold his calls, while he calls Colonel Broderick at Site Y.Ray Clark makes it to El Paso an strikes up a conversation with a girl (Colette Jackson), who wonders why no soldiers have patronized the bar, though a base must be located nearby, as she and the bar owner see and hear planes flying in and out of a remote area at all hours. Clark gets into his automobile and drives down a desert road, and takes a turn-off. Then a helicopter drops out of the sky, and out steps a stone-faced guard, gun drawn, to arrest Clark.Paul Girard has made it to Gibraltar, and meets with Barnswell aboard his flagship (USS Kitty Hawk, CVAN 63). Barnswell breaks into a sweat, then agrees to write a detailed confession.Jiggs Casey goes to see Ellie Holbrook at her home. From her he gets a detailed and lurid story of her affair with Scott--in which Scott was so supremely sure of himself that he would write letters to her describing all the details of their relationship, none of which are safe for work.

Casey makes no effort to hide his monumental distaste, and lets Todd know that he does not appreciate the inference. Lyman stops the nasty argument and assures Casey that, thanks to Paul Girard securing a written confession from Barnswell, he, Lyman, won't have to use the letters. But then Presidential secretary Esther Townsend (Helen Kleeb) brings in a dire message: Paul Girard is dead, killed in a crash of the airliner he was on.

Colonel Broderick, now back from his errand to Blue Lake, tells Clark that he's not going anywhere for awhile, and leaves him a bottle of booze. Clark pours this down a sink drain after reading a newspaper account of Girard's death.Henry Whitney (Fredd Wayne), an attaché at the US Embassy in Madrid, visits the crash site looking for the personal effects of Girard and the one other listed American passenger.Back on Site Y, late at night, Colonel Henderson visits Clark in his locked room.

Then the two men debate one another's moral position. Scott insists that he could be elected by acclimation whenever he asked. Lyman stands on the Constitution, elections, and the very real possibility that the Soviets would attack at once upon sensing that the United States was falling to a military dictator. In the end, Lyman demands Scott's resignation, and those of Hardesty, Riley and Diefenbach, and says that he will announce that demand in a press conference the following afternoon.Scott passes Casey on his way out and leaves without a word. Lyman then comes out of the Oval Office, hands the Scott Letters to Casey, and tells them to give them back to Ellie.(Sunday 18 May) Scott's plans have gone more than a trifle awry. Obviously, the EComCon Airlift did *not* take place as planned. So Scott plans to tape a delayed broadcast ""to take his case to the people."" Hardesty, Riley and Diefenbach are highly dubious by this time, but Scott presses on.President Lyman begins his press conference, pre-empting the Preakness Race to do it. Then he delays it for half an hour, when Henry Whitney shows up--with the Barnswell statement, which Whitney did manage to recover from the wreckage of Paul Girard's doomed flight. (Girard had hidden it in a cigarette case that Lyman had given him as a special gift.) After ordering Whitney to keep the paper secret, Lyman has it copied out.Casey goes to the E-Ring to hand-deliver a copy of the Barnswell statement to Scott, together with Lyman's written demand for Scott's resignation. Scott accuses Casey of betraying him, and Casey accuses Scott of betraying his country and ""disgrac[ing] the four stars on his uniform.""Scott goes to a TV station to record his belligerent message. But before he can begin, a panicked Prentice and McPherson inform him that the President has a signed statement giving names and dates and implicating them all. Scott contemptuously dismisses the two men and returns to the E-Ring--where he overhears Lyman accepting the resignations of Hardesty, Riley and Diefenbach. Now utterly defeated, he gets back into his staff car and orders his driver to take him ""home.""Casey goes to see Ellie, who knows perfectly well why Casey took the Scott Letters. As he hands them back to her, she accepts Casey's word that the letters ""might have been"" ""the bullets"" to ""[shoot down]"" Scott, but weren't. The two agree to see each other again, after the excitement has died down.Lastly, Lyman declares that it is ""slander"" to suggest that the United States cannot be strong without directly waging war. He insists that world peace, and freedom, will come peaceably. With that, and a display of the Constitution, the film ends.

The murders were witnessed by Lucy and Frank's then adolescent daughter, Carol Harbin, who was eventually adopted by Lucy's brother and his wife, Bill and Emily Cutler. With only a brusque hand named Leo Krause helping, the Cutlers now live on a farm in California, far away from the Harbins' house in Ohio where the murders were committed so that Carol could get away from the public scrutiny of her mother's murderous act. The Board at the asylum, believing she now reformed and well enough on new medications, is releasing Lucy into Bill and Emily's custody, the decision against the advice of Lucy's physician, Dr. Anderson. Carol, an up and coming sculptress, is nervously excited about seeing her mother after twenty years. Carol wants to be as open as possible about her mother's situation to others, however she tells only one person not in the know about Lucy, namely her boyfriend, Michael Fields, the son of wealthy dairy owners, Raymond and Alison Fields. As Carol and Michael are planning on getting married, Carol wants no secrets of this nature from Michael. Seeing how scared and depressed her mother looks, Carol wants to brighten her life by transforming her into the young, vivacious woman Carol remembers as her mother. However, that transformation as well as other issues in general life evoke the murders and the incarceration for Lucy, who still seems to be suffering from mental illness exacerbated by these emotional triggers. Eventually, some people within this situation go missing, the collective, with the exception of the perpetrator, not knowing that the missing have been killed by someone wielding an ax. Has Lucy reverted back into her ax murdering ways?

                    Debauched King Henry II installs his longtime court facilitator Thomas Becket as the Archbishop of Canterbury, assuming that his old friend will be a compliant and loyal lackey in the King's ongoing battles with the church. But Becket unexpectedly finds his true calling on the ecclesiastical side, and aligns himself against the king's selfish wishes, causing a rift and an eventual showdown not only between the two men, but also the institutions they represent.

Bare to the waist, the king kneels to receive a flogging from Saxon monks. He begins to reminisce, recalling at first the carefree, promiscuous adventures with Becket, then his favorite drinking and wenching companion. A violently emotional drama that probes the changing relationship between two young men - between two close friends bound together by similar pride of flesh and spirit who become deadly enemies as they pursue their separate destinies . . . that of king . . . and saint.

For the Norman King, his Saxon subject is also a confidant, giving him advice and offering loyalty he finds rarely among the Barons who serve him. The King is in constant conflict with the Church who refuse to contribute to the financing of his war to recover lost territory in France and jealously guard the tax-free status given to them by previous monarchs. The King sees an opportunity to change the status quo and appoints Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury when the post becomes vacant. He does not count on his loyal vassal's devotion to the Church and to God above any loyalties that he may once had to the throne. The clash of these two powerful personalities inevitably leads to destruction.

Rather than appoint another pious cleric loyal to Rome and the Church, he will appoint his old drinking and wenching buddy, Thomas Becket, technically a deacon of the church, to the post.

Walter recruits the team, which includes alarms expert Cedric Page (Robert Morley), strong man Hans Fisher (Jess Hahn), and circus acrobat Giulio ""the Human Fly"" (Gilles Ségal). Since the museum's floor is completely pressure-alarmed, it will be necessary to lower Giulio by rope from a rooftop window and raise the the heavy glass cover enclosing the mannequin on which the dagger is displayed. Giulio will then replace the dagger with a copy and leave the scene intact in the hope that the theft will not be discovered until the thieves leave the country. This method will require two strong men, Hans and Walter, holding ropes - one to raise the glass cover and the other to hold Giulio.The plan calls for shooting out a searchlight and exploding smoke grenades to distract the guards when the team leaves the museum. Walter hides a rifle and some smoke grenades inside the door jamb of a convertable limousine. In Greece, he hires a small-time hustler named Arthur Simpson (Peter Ustinov) to drive the car to Istanbul. When Simpson arrives at Turkish customs, he is detained for an expired passport and the officials become suspicious of his disjointed personal history. The car is searched and the contraband discovered. Simpson is now accused of abetting terrorism, a capital offense.Simpson manages to convince Maj. Ali Tufan (Ege Ernart) that he knows nothing of the supposed terrorist plot. He agrees to redeem himself by infiltrating the gang as a spy for Turkish security. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he informs Walter and Elizabeth that, due to a bureaucratic mixup, only the person who brought the car into the country is allowed to drive it. Walter and Elizabeth reluctantly agree to hire Simpson as their chauffeur during their ""touristic"" visit, so he joins them at their rented villa.Simpson does his best to ferret out information, leaving messages for the police in discarded cigarette packs, but he learns little. One evening, the drunken and obnoxious cook Gerven (Akim Tamiroff) annoys Hans to the point that a melee breaks out. In the confusion, Hans manages to break his hands when a window is slammed shut. With Hans out of commission, the plan cannot go forward without a second rope holder, and Cedric demurs that he is not strong enough.Walter and Elizabeth put Simpson through a test of strength, which he passes, barely. They decide to offer Simpson $10,000 to participate in the robbery. Simpson agrees, but then lets slip that he is working for Turkish security. Walter decides to go through with the robbery anyway, but to move it forward to that same evening.Though the group is being tailed by police, they manage to slip away one by one at a crowded wrestling match. Since they can no longer shoot out lights or use smoke grenades, Elizabeth, with Cedric's help, will distract the guards using her feminine wiles. Walter, Guilo and Simpson enter the museum just before closing time, hide, and eventualy make their way to the roof, where Simpson announces that he has a fear of heights. They manage to get across the roof anyway, and as soon as darkness falls Guilio is slipped in through a high window. The plan almost fails when Simpson lets the rope slip, but he recovers just in time.

    Synopsis
    Professional jewel thief Elizabeth Lipp (Melina Mercouri) reunites with her former lover and partner Walter Harper (Maximilian Schell) for the score of her life - the theft of an exquisite jeweled dagger from the Topkapi museum, located in the former Ottoman imperial palace in Istanbul. Walter recruits the team, which includes alarms expert Cedric Page (Robert Morley), strong man Hans Fisher (Jess Hahn), and circus acrobat Giulio ""the Human Fly"" (Gilles Ségal). Since the museum's floor is completely pressure-alarmed, it will be necessary to lower Giulio by rope from a rooftop window and raise the the heavy glass cover enclosing the mannequin on which the dagger is displayed. Giulio will then replace the dagger with a copy and leave the scene intact in the hope that the theft will not be discovered until the thieves leave the country. This method will require two strong men, Hans and Walter, holding ropes - one to raise the glass cover and the other to hold Giulio.The plan calls for shooting out a searchlight and exploding smoke grenades to distract the guards when the team leaves the museum. Walter hides a rifle and some smoke grenades inside the door jamb of a convertable limousine. In Greece, he hires a small-time hustler named Arthur Simpson (Peter Ustinov) to drive the car to Istanbul. When Simpson arrives at Turkish customs, he is detained for an expired passport and the officials become suspicious of his disjointed personal history. The car is searched and the contraband discovered. Simpson is now accused of abetting terrorism, a capital offense.Simpson manages to convince Maj. Ali Tufan (Ege Ernart) that he knows nothing of the supposed terrorist plot. He agrees to redeem himself by infiltrating the gang as a spy for Turkish security. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he informs Walter and Elizabeth that, due to a bureaucratic mixup, only the person who brought the car into the country is allowed to drive it. Walter and Elizabeth reluctantly agree to hire Simpson as their chauffeur during their ""touristic"" visit, so he joins them at their rented villa.Simpson does his best to ferret out information, leaving messages for the police in discarded cigarette packs, but he learns little. One evening, the drunken and obnoxious cook Gerven (Akim Tamiroff) annoys Hans to the point that a melee breaks out. In the confusion, Hans manages to break his hands when a window is slammed shut. With Hans out of commission, the plan cannot go forward without a second rope holder, and Cedric demurs that he is not strong enough.Walter and Elizabeth put Simpson through a test of strength, which he passes, barely. They decide to offer Simpson $10,000 to participate in the robbery. Simpson agrees, but then lets slip that he is working for Turkish security. Walter decides to go through with the robbery anyway, but to move it forward to that same evening.Though the group is being tailed by police, they manage to slip away one by one at a crowded wrestling match. Since they can no longer shoot out lights or use smoke grenades, Elizabeth, with Cedric's help, will distract the guards using her feminine wiles. Walter, Guilo and Simpson enter the museum just before closing time, hide, and eventualy make their way to the roof, where Simpson announces that he has a fear of heights. They manage to get across the roof anyway, and as soon as darkness falls Guilio is slipped in through a high window. The plan almost fails when Simpson lets the rope slip, but he recovers just in time. As planned, Guilio switches the daggers and the three depart the museum.The dagger is brought to the courier who will take it out of the country. It looks like everything has gone according to plan, but of course there is an unexpected twist at the end.

                    Jumpei Niki, a Tokyo based entomologist and educator, is in a poor seaside village collecting specimens of sand insects. As it is late in the day and as he has missed the last bus back to the city, some of the local villagers suggest that he spend the night there, they offering to find him a place to stay. That place is the home of a young woman, whose house is located at the bottom of a sand pit accessible only by ladder. He later learns that the woman's husband and child died in a sandstorm, their undiscovered bodies buried somewhere near the house. The next morning as he tries to leave, he finds that the ladder is gone - he realizing that the ladder he climbed down was a rope ladder which is anchored above the pit - meaning that he is trapped with the young woman as the walls of the pit are sand with no grip. He also realizes that this entrapment was the villagers and the young woman's plan for him to stay there permanently to be her helper in the never-ending task of digging out the sand, which if not done will swallow them alive. They are dependent upon the villagers to help remove the sand, but also for their rations including water. He learns that the sand is the young woman's life, and that she knows or wants no other life. Thus, it is no use either to blackmail or kill her as she is willing to live and die by this life, and as such he will surely die if she is dead. His life tasks become to figure out a way to escape while co-exist with the woman in what he considers their prison. As time goes on, he also learns that there are other tasks which will consume him.

                    Along a rocky, barren coastline, Jesus begins teaching, primarily using parables. He attracts disciples; he's stern, brusque, and demanding. He comes to bring a sword, not peace, he says. He's in a hurry, moving from place to place near the Sea of Galilee, sometimes attracting a multitude, sometimes being driven away. His parables often take on the powers that be, so he and his teachings come to the attention of the Pharisees, the chief priests, and elders. They conspire to have him arrested, beaten, tried, and crucified, just as he prophesied to his followers. After he dies, he appears to his disciples and gives them final instructions.

This is evident when he finds his own children (Bomar & Girmar) spending much time watching Earth Programs on the videoscope. Kimar's wife, Momar, suggests that he seek advice from Chochem, the Ancient One.Kimar gathers a number of other Martians and goes to see Chochem. Though it is the middle of Septober on Mars, Chochem explains that on Earth, it is drawing closer to Christmas, and this could explain why the children of Mars are behaving so strangely. Chochem then goes on to decry how Mars tends immediately work on educating their young, giving no time for play or fun. Chochem finally decrees that the children must have fun, and says that Mars needs a Santa Claus, just as Earth has.Kimar takes Chochem's words to heart, and assembles a crew to go to Earth to capture Santa Claus. Of the crew, almost everyone is in agreement except for Voldar, who reluctantly comes along, even though he feels this is a mistake.Observing the Earth, the men are shocked to find that there seem to be hundreds of Santa's, many of whom are standing on corners ringing bells.

As the hitmen walk toward North's upstairs classroom, the teacher receives a phone call from the blind principal's aide, warning him of their arrival. However, a saddened Johnny responds, ""It's okay. I know them."" He calmly waits at his desk as Charlie and Lee enter the classroom and shoot him to death in a fusilade of bullets.As they depart town by train, Charlie admits that he is bothered that North refused to flee, aware that he was warned prior to their arrival. Lee also notes that from the look on Johnny's face when they entered the classroom is that he wanted them to kill him. It is revealed here that both Charlie and Lee were annoymously sub-contracted by an unseen party to kill Johnny North. It is apparent that the hitmen's business is not to make any direct contact with their paying clients, or know their names, just the name of their hit. Charlie and Lee run through a file they were given of what they knew about the man they have just killed. Johnny was once a champion race car driver whose career ended in a violent crash. Four years before his death, he was involved in a one million dollar mail truck robbery. Tempted by the thought of a $1 million payday, Charlie and Lee travel to Miami in order to interview Johnny's former mechanic, Earl Sylvester (Claude Atkins).Earl, who considers himself Johnny's only friend, is devastated to learn of his death. In between sobs and gulps of whiskey, he tells the story to Charlie and Lee as he remembers it:Four years earlier. Johnny North was at the top of his profession when he met the beautiful Sheila Farr (Angie Dickinson) who asked him out to dinner. Despite Earl's suspicions, Johnny fell deeply in love and planned to propose marriage after winning his next big race. However, Johnny's late night days with Sheila had left him disoriented from lack of sleep. As a result, his racing career ended with a fiery crash.At the hospital, Earl told Johnny the truth about Sheila, who was in reality the mistress of mob boss Jack Browning (Ronald Reagan). Known for her extravagent taste for ""adrenellen junkies"", Sheila had already cheated on Browning with several other sports figures, all of whom met bad ends (usually violent deaths or ""accidents""). Enraged and heartbroken, Johnny rebuffed Sheila's attempts to explain and he cut his ties to her.Flashing forward back to the present, the intrigued Charlie and Lee approach a former member of Browning's crew, named Mickey (Norman Fell), who also reveals his memories:One year after the crash, Sheila found Johnny working as a pit mechanic during another race. Although Johnny bitterly attempted to drive her away, Sheila insisted on telling him that a much better job might soon be his for the taking.Meanwhile, Browning was in the process of planning the robbery of a U.S. postal truck. On Sheila's recommendation, he agreed to take Johnny on as his getaway driver.After Johnny refused to return her phone calls, Sheila called at his dilapidated tenement. Although Johnny still felt betrayed, Sheila said that she had always regretted losing him and could not live without him. Deeply moved, Johnny agreed to forgive her. He also helped Browning by souping up the getaway car.However, Browning was deeply enraged when he learned that Sheila had returned to Johnny. In a deliberate provocation, Browning brutally slapped Sheila in front of Johnny. Enraged, Johnny instantly punched Browning in the face and threatened to kill him if he ever hurt Sheila again. However, they both agreed to ""settle this,"" after the job, and went back to planning the robbery.Ultimately, the mail truck was forced onto an isolated mountain road by a detour sign planted by Browning and Johnny. When the truck later stopped at an apparent accident, Browning, Johnny, and the other conspirators robbed the truck at gunpoint, stole more than $1 million, aned loaded it into the getaway car. However, Johnny punched Browning, threw him out of the moving car, and drove off with the money for himself.Flashing back to the present, after listening to this story, Charlie and Lee decide to pay a visit to Jack Browning, who is now a real estate developer in Los Angeles. After arriving in L.A., Charlie and Lee pay a visit to Browning who denies knowing who they are when they ask about the mail truck robbery or if he knew Johnny North. Browning, however, insists that he is now an honest businessman and has no idea what happened to the money. He does, however, reveal that Sheila is staying at a downtown hotel and agrees to arrange a meeting with her.Determined not to give Browning time to plan an ambush, Charlie and Lee arrive at Sheila's hotel room several hours earlier than agreed. At first Sheila denies knowing Johnny or anything about the money. However, Charlie and Lee brutally beat her and dangle her by the ankles out of her seventh story window. Terrified, she agrees to tell them the truth:Flashing back to the night before the robbery, Sheila entered Johnny's room and told him that his life was in danger. Browning, she said, was planning to kill him and pocket his share of the robbery. Enraged, Johnny wanted to leave and kill Browning on the spot. Sheila, however, insisted that she had a much better idea. On her advice, Johnny threw Browning out of the car and drove off with the money. Later that night, he met with Sheila.As the two lovers departed with the money to a nearby hotel room, they were confronted by Browning. Sheila ordered Browning to, ""do it quickly,"" and the gangster shot Johnny in the stomach. Although severely wounded, Johnny fled into the night with Browning and Sheila in hot pursuit. Unable to find him, Sheila expressed fear that Johnny would cause as much trouble as his predecessors whom she duped into helping them with their plans. Therefore, it was Browning who annoymously hired Charlie and Lee to murder him.As Sheila comes to the end of her story, Charlie realizes at last why Johnny refused to flee when they went to kill him. The only man who refuses to run is a man who considers himself to be already dead. Sheila's betrayal had already emtionally killed Johnny long before the bullets ever touched him. Johnny wanted to die (though it is unclear if he knew that Browning was behind the hit).

Browning maintains that it was not him who hired Charlie and Lee to kill Johnny, but it was Sheila. Charlie calmly shoots Browning dead and turns his revolver toward Sheila.

                    In a poor neighborhood of New York, the bitter and lonely Jewish pawnbroker Sol Nazerman is a survivor from Auschwitz that has no emotions or feelings. Sol lost his dearest family and friends in the war and his faith in God and belief in mankind. Now he only cares for money and is haunted by daydreams, actually flashbacks from the period of the concentration camp. Sol's assistant is the ambitious Latino Jesus Ortiz, who wants to learn with Sol how to run a business of his own. When Sol realizes that the obscure laundry business he has with the powerful gangster Rodriguez comes also from brothels, Sol recalls the fate of his beloved wife in the concentration camp and has a nervous breakdown. His attitude leads Jesus Ortiz to tragedy and Sol finds a way to cry.

                    Sol Nazerman manages a pawnshop in Harlem, which provides him enough money to support comfortably his sister-in-law's family on Long Island and the widow of an old colleague. He is an emotionless and direct man, which makes him effective, from an economic perspective, in negotiating with his largely desperate customers as he has no feeling about their plight. Most of his pawnshop acquaintances are unaware that his abrupt and detached demeanor is a result of what he witnessed as a Jewish concentration camp inhabitant during WWII, those incidents witnessed including the rape of his wife and the murder of his family by their Nazi captors. What happens on the streets of Harlem often reminds him of incidents at the concentration camp, he shutting off his feelings from what he now sees to survive emotionally. Before the war, he was a professor, a term which he now views with disdain. He has just hired a young man named Jesus Ortiz to work in the shop. Jesus, who has led a life of petty crime up until now, sees this job and his association with Sol, who he sees not only as a boss but a friend and mentor, as his first step in turning over a new leaf. One person who suspects what Sol has gone through is the new welfare worker in the neighborhood, Marilyn Birchfield, who has her own reasons for trying to break through his defenses. His life takes a turn when he discovers the true nature of the pawnshop owner, Rodriguez, which, although a negative in the issue itself, at least allows him to feel again for the first time since the war. The question becomes what he is going to do about it, especially in relation to Miss Birchfield and Jesus.

When they arrive at their hotel, the Moon Spinners, a village wedding is in progress. The proprietress, Sophia, did not receive the telegram Nicky sent to reserve a room. She says there are no rooms available. Nicky and Frances are exhausted and after Sophia's teenage son Alexis intervenes, she reluctantly gives them a room for the night. But her brother Stratos is furious. Since his return from England he has been acting strangely. He does not want guests staying at the hotel but promises Sophia that soon they will have all the money they want. Sophia is very suspicious of his dealings with what she calls a strange Englishman.Nicky notices a young man in the crowd and learns he is also a guest. His name is Mark Camford and he is on holiday from England. He notices Stratos leaving and asks if he is going snorkeling in the Bay of Dolphins. This makes Stratos angry. Mark tells Nicky that he also likes to snorkel in the bay. They dance and enjoy the wedding festivities. Before saying goodnight, Mark asks Nicky to meet him the following day for a picnic.Instead of going to bed, Mark returns to the Bay of Dolphins to spy on Stratos, who is in a boat. He does not notice that he has been followed. A fight ensues and Mark is shot. He dives into the water and disappears. Stratos and the other man assume he has drowned. Later, Stratos goes to Mark's hotel room and takes all his belongings.The next morning, Nicky is puzzled when Mark doesn't show up for their picnic. Stratos tells her he checked out very early that morning. Not believing him, Nicky goes on a search. She finds Mark's shoe on the beach and traces him to a nearby church. He was shot in the arm but refuses to explain what is going on. Seeing that he needs medical treatment, Nicky covers him with her sweater and races back to the hotel, stopping first in Mark's room to bring him fresh clothing. But there is nothing there. She takes her aunt's traveling blanket and first aid kit, plus a bottle of brandy from the bar. Frances is listening to a group of native women singing and doesn't notice Nicky sneaking in and out.Once Mark is attended to, he orders Nicky to leave but he still won't explain why Stratos is after him. Back at the hotel, Frances reports the loss of her blanket and first aid kit. Stratos realizes that Nicky must have taken them for Mark, which means the young man is not dead after all. He encounters Nicky in the village and she tries to steer him away from the church. But he goes there, forcibly taking her with him, and finds her blood-stained sweater.As the day passes, Frances becomes worried when Nicky doesn't return. Stratos assures her that Nicky has probably gotten lost and will soon turn up. Alexis is riding his donkey near a windmill when he hears a cry for help. Stratos has tied Nicky to a post in the loft. Just then Mark turns up and they rescue her. But Stratos is not far behind and the pair set off for the next village to summon the police. On the way Mark tells Nicky his story. In London he worked at a bank but was fired after a client's jewels disappeared. He suspected Stratos, who fled the country soon after. Determined to clear his name, Mark followed him to Crete and the Bay of Dolphins. He is positive that the missing jewels are somewhere underwater.Sophia suspects that her brother is involved in Nicky's disappearance. Once again he threatens her and hints that something might happen to Alexis if she doesn't keep her mouth shut. Frances is frantic and Stratos makes a point of organizing a search party for Nicky.Stratos's friend catches up with Nicky and Mark. He is overpowered and knocked out, and now the pair have his shotgun. They decide to spend the night in some ruins. Stratos shows up but is spooked by the feral cats occupying the ruins. After a cursory search, he leaves.The next morning, Nicky and Mark are awakened by an elderly man who turns out to be John Gamble, the British counsel. His explanation for being there, to observe the ruins at daybreak, sounds rather fishy. But Mark's injury needs medical treatment, so they agree to accompany him to his home. His wife Cynthia is a nurse and will be able to help Mark. Gamble persuades them to leave the shotgun behind. By the time they reach the consulate, Nicky has told Gamble all about Stratos. Gamble assures them they will be safe there. He will send a car for Frances and arrange for them to be flown to a hospital in Athens.Cynthia takes them upstairs. Gamble goes into a room where Stratos is waiting. He is very angry at Stratos for bungling the operation and asks how he thought two British subjects could disappear without anyone noticing. Stratos mumbles a weak excuse but Gamble is through with him. He orders Stratos to return to the village and wait for further instructions.After a bath and some food, Nicky is feeling much better. Cynthia brings her a dress to wear until her aunt arrives with their luggage. But she fears Mark's injury will become infected. She gave him some medicine and he is sleeping. Nicky goes downstairs and by using Gamble's telescope, observes a yacht on the water. Gamble turns her attention to something else, obviously trying to distract her. When Nicky finally sees Mark, he is very suspicious of the Gambles. He tells Nicky that the jewels cannot be sold on the open market, so Stratos will try to find a private buyer. Madam Habib is a wealthy eccentric who travels on a luxurious yacht. She collects jewels and Stratos will likely approach her. Nicky thinks the yacht she saw might belong to Madam Habib, which turns out to be true.Mark believes that Cynthia has deliberately drugged him. He tries to get dressed but collapses. Frances arrives and Gamble sends them to the airport in a hearse, the only vehicle available because a street festival is going on. Frances is up front with the driver while Nicky and Mark are in the back. He is wearing street clothes under his pajamas and tells Nicky he is returning to the Bay of Dolphins. She follows him but can't keep up. He boards a bus and is gone.Nicky steals a boat and goes out to the yacht. She is taken on board and tells her story to Madam Habib, who is very suspicious of her. Meanwhile, Stratos and his accomplice retrieve the jewels from an underwater container in the Bay of Dolphins. They escape in their boat just as the police, accompanied by Mark, arrive.Madam Habib admits that she is expecting Stratos and forces Nicky to hide in a closet. Stratos arrives with the jewels, giving Madam Habib only a brief glance at them before demanding immediate payment. When she leaves to get the money, Nicky sneezes inside the closet. Stratos finds her and they struggle. Just then the police burst in and arrest Stratos. The jewels will be returned to their rightful owner and Mark's name is cleared.","
    
                    British musicologist Frances Ferris and her late teen niece Nicky Ferris are traveling through Crete recording Greek folk songs for the BBC. In the usually quiet coastal town of Aghios Georgios, they manage to get a room at an inn called the Moon-Spinners, despite the people at the inn being busy preparing for a wedding, and no one there, except Alexis, the young teen son of the proprietress Sophia, he who is fond of spouting current popular Americanisms in his slightly broken English, seeming to want them there. Frances and Nicky learn from Alexis that the unwelcoming feeling is all because of his maternal Uncle Stratos, who has become a man suspicious of anyone ever since his recent return from London after being away for fifteen years. Beyond those there for the wedding, the only other guest at the inn is a young Englishman named Mark Camford, who they befriend. Nicky is too preoccupied with her own suspicions and mistrust of Stratos truly to see that there is something more sinister in the feelings between Stratos and Mark. Although they don't say anything to each other directly on the matter, Stratos knows why Mark is in Aghios Georgios and is always skin diving in the nearby Bay of Dolphins, and Mark knows that Stratos and by association his other nephew Lambis will be after him if he gets too close to what they have hidden in the bay before their intended method of disposal. By getting close to Mark, Nicky may unwittingly get caught up in what is the very dangerous and potentially life threatening game of cat-and-mouse between Stratos and Mark.

Helen Gurley Brown is a bright and beautiful 23 year old psychologist who has authored the best-selling book ""Sex and the Single Girl."" Weston realizes that Brown won't grant him an interview because she has already been the subject of one of his exploitative articles, so he masquerades as his friend and neighbor Frank Broderick, a hosiery manufacturer henpecked by a jealous wife. After several counseling sessions as a patient with the attractive Dr. Brown complications arise when the womanizing writer starts to fall in love with the psychologist.

                    Those at Stop Magazine pride themselves in how depraved their minds and thus their associated articles are. The more depraved the articles, the higher the readership. The head depravee is its managing editor, Bob Weston. Bob is most proud of a recent cover story they ran on ""Sex and the Single Girl"" author, twenty-three year old Dr. Helen Gurley Brown, the story questioning her own sexual experience or lack thereof. Helen prides herself on being both a noted academic and a doctor who gives practical, sage and useful advice for the single woman, and as such detests the story for what it's done to her reputation - and that of the institute for which she works - and her now dwindling patient base. Bob wants to do a follow-up article with information straight from her mouth, but knows that Dr. Brown obviously won't agree to the story or grant an interview. So Bob poses as a patient, specifically using his always bickering but in love neighbor Frank Broderick, a hosiery manufacturer, as a cover. The nature of Frank's arguments with his wife Sylvia Broderick stem from Sylvia's jealousy since Frank is always looking at other women's legs, which Frank counters is only a professional interest. As Helen's sessions progress with Bob posing as Frank, Helen starts to fall in love with him, and Bob starts to fall in love with her. As such, Bob may have second thoughts about doing the story, which may put him at odds with the Chief, his editor and publisher. Complications ensue when Helen wants to speak with Sylvia, who has no idea what Bob is doing. As Helen does manage to contact Sylvia, Bob tries to conjure up a fake Sylvia of his own. Throw in a couple of cabbies who are working on their own agendas and a highway patrolman who just can't seem to pick up any speed and the misunderstandings between Bob, Helen, Frank and Sylvia start to pile up, as do the traffic incidents.

The town is under threat due to a break in the water supply system and wealthy businessman Clint Stark advises everyone that he's prepared to buy them all out, lock, stock and barrel. What he doesn't tell anyone is that the railroad will run through the town in less than a year's time. The local newspaperman, Ed Cunningham and the librarian Angela Benedict both think Stark is up to no good. Dr. Lao spins his magic and the good townsfolk can have their fortune told; be introduced to Pan, the God Joy; or entertained by Merlin the magician and his tricks. Dr. Lao gets them to look at life differently and not to sell out to the highest bidder.

Ed has unrequited love for the widow librarian Angela Benedict and opposes to the powerful rancher Clint Stark that wants to buy the lands of the inhabitants of Abalone.

There is a meeting in the town to decide whether the locals will sell their real estates to Stark or not but the decision is postponed after the arrival of Dr. Lao. During the night, the dwellers go to the circus to see The Abominable Snowman, Merlin the Magician, Apollonius of Tyana, Pan, The Giant Serpent and Medusa.

Bey kneels before the mummy and offers himself as a sacrifice. The mummy breaks out of the net and crushes Bey's head with its foot before leaving without attacking anyone else, followed by the police. This proves to the Inspector and Bray that only those present at the opening of the sarcophagus are in danger, which still means Bray and Annette.At his house Beauchamp shows Annette his collection of Egyptian relics. Annette questions how he has his knowledge and Beauchamp reveals that he is Rameses's other son, cursed by Rameses to everlasting life, who can only die by the hand of his brother Ra who was killed by the assassins he sent. But now he has the chance for peace since he can die as Ra has returned to life. He places the medallion around Annette's neck and makes her repeat the words to awaken Ra's mummy. Before he can die he instructs Ra to kill Annette, the last of the tomb pillagers. Bray and the police burst in so Ra and Beauchamp take Annette into the underground tunnels. As they struggle with their pursuers to close the door behind them, Beauchamp's hand is trapped and severed as the door closes. However, Ra won't kill Annette because of her beauty. As Beauchamp takes out a knife to stab her himself, Ra stops him and forces him underwater, drowning him. The mummy leaves with the medallion and pulls down the roof of the tunnel on top of him, burying himself under a pile of stones and rocks, leaving Annette safe to be rescued by the police.","

                    When British archaeologists disturb the tomb of Ra, they have to deal with a curse that condemns anyone involved to death. The American showman who paid for the expedition, Alexander King, insists in taking the precious artifacts to London for an exhibition even though he could have left them for the local authorities who were prepared to pay a hefty price for them. As a result they not only have to face the curse but the wrath of Egyptians who have vowed have the precious find returned. When King finally has his first public showing, he finds that the sarcophagus is empty, the mummy having been taken or - more ominously - come to life to seek revenge.

                    Three stories about the lives and loves of those who own a certain yellow Rolls-Royce: **First purchased by the Marquess of Frinton for his wife as a belated anniversary present, the Marchiness finds her own use for the vehicle - one which prompts her husband to sell the car in disgust. **Gangster Paolo Maltese's moll, Mae, thinks the Rolls is a ""classy"" car in which to tour Paolo's home town in Italy. When Paolo is called away to the States to finish some ""business"", a bored Mae takes the Rolls on a spin through the country, enjoying both the sights and the handsome Italian photographer who crosses her path. **By the outbreak of World War II, the car has come into the possession of socialite Gerda Millet. While on her way to visit Yugoslavian royalty, Gerda and the Rolls become (at first) unwitting and then (eventually) most willing participants in the Yugoslavian fight.

                    Three stories of love-hurt linked only by a yellow Rolls Royce. Marquess Charles Printon, an aristocrat and diplomatic official of the British Foreign and Colonial Office in the days of the British Empire, buys a yellow brand new Phantom model as a belated anniversary present for his wife Eloyse. They attend the extremely fashionable Ascot horse Races, a socialite event never missed by the royal family, where the Marquess has a horse competing, which wins a cup, but any pride and joy taste bitter after finding Eloyse red-lipped committing infidelity in the Rolls with an assistant of his, without either knowing if there is actual love between them. For appearances sake, they agree as a modus vivendi to pretend nothing has changed. The cuckolded diplomat can no longer bear to look at the Rolls Royce, so it's sold and shipped to the Italian Rivièra where -alledgedly after a maharajah, who lost it again in Monte Carlo casino- the Yankee mafioso Paolo Maltese buys it, eager to show his ancestral country to his spoiled, slutty fiancée Mae, who alas appreciates nothing Italian and only starts having fun after they meet the young Stefano, an attractive young guide-photographer, who proves himself as an entertaining flirter. When Paolo must return a few days to Miami for business, he leaves Mae to continue the tour she couldn't care less for, nor the old lieutenant Joey Maltese left to chaperon her, so they are both bored, take a spin to the Amalfi coast, and in Sorianao bump into Stefano again, who this time gets to entertain and seduce Mae, and during a swim takes her diving to a mythological nymph's grotto, where Stefano finally learns how his till then unrecognized dangerous rival is, yet they finally kiss, silently noted by Joey, but she dreads Paolo's impending return, and just in time decides to dump her lover rather then risk a bloodbath... In 1941 the Rolls is in Trieste, where the Yugoslav Davich begs a ride from American celebrity Gerda Millet, who is on her way to visit his king Peter, is smuggled in the car-boot; soon war catches up, while his Mediterranean charm...

                    Three separate stories of the love lives of the various owners of the same 1939 yellow Rolls-Royce Phantom are told. The original owner, Lord Charles, the Marquess of Frinton, buys it as a tenth wedding anniversary present for his French wife, Lady Eloise, on the eve of the Ascot Gold Cup, in which he has a horse entered and is expected to win. As Lord Charles focuses on the activities around the race and his diplomatic duties, he may be unaware of Lady Eloise's own activities, which may make this anniversary and the gift a memorable one, but not in a good way. Over 2,000 miles later, Paolo Maltese, a world renowned American gangster, buys the Rolls-Royce for his girlfriend and fiancée, Mae Jenkins, as a vehicle in which to travel around Italy. On their travels, they meet a street photographer named Stefano, who flirts with Mae, which Paolo believes is innocent and harmless enough. Despite Mae outwardly calling Stefano amoral for flirting with her, an engaged woman, she falls for him, and he in return truly does fall in love with her. As Paolo is called back to the US to deal with business, Mae and Stefano are able to spend time together. Mae has to decide if she loves Stefano enough to leave him, since Paolo would never let her go. And Paolo's right hand man, Joey Friedlander, who has seen what has happened between Mae and Stefano, will have to decide if he will rat them out to Paolo for his own self-preservation. The car having seen better days, it, in 1941, comes under the ownership of middle aged American socialite, Gerda Millett, an overbearing and headstrong woman who always gets her way or else, and is somewhat oblivious to world activities outside of her general sphere. In Trieste, she is planning on making a trip into Yugoslavia to meet with the new Prince, Peter. In Trieste, she is persuaded by a Yugolsav national named Davich to give him ride to his homeland. It isn't until they are approaching the border that she learns he is a Yugoslav revolutionary, who, despite her earliest concerns, is not out to kill Prince Peter, but rather work to defeat what he and his colleagues know will be the imminent Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia. Beyond the issue of getting Davich over the border without being detected by border control, Mrs. Millett may see first hand for what Davich is fighting if they do make it across.

Their estrangement was due to the fact that callous Maggie stole wealthy Frank from Edie when Frank and Edie were dating. As such, Maggie went on to live a life of luxury, while Edie currently owns a seedy bar on which she is three months behind in rent. To gain what she believes is rightfully hers after she finds out some information about how Maggie coerced Frank to marry her, Edie decides to murder Maggie and take on her identity. In doing so, Edie plans on passing off the dead body as herself, the death by suicide. In taking on Maggie's identity, Edie has to convince Maggie's servants, acquaintances and friends that she really is Maggie. The most difficult of these people to convince may be golf pro Tony Collins, who had a somewhat secret and special relationship with Maggie about which Edie was initially unaware. Edie may also have some problems convincing Sgt. Jim Hobbson, who is investigating Edie's death and who is also Edie's boyfriend. The problems for Edie posing as Maggie are compounded when she discovers the circumstances behind Frank's death.

                    This study of Cuba--partially written by renowned poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko--captures the island just before it made the transition to a post-revolutionary society. Moving from city to country and back again, I AM CUBA examines the various problems caused by political oppression as well as by great discrepancies in wealth and power. Beginning in Havana in the pre-Castro era, we see how foreigners contributed to the city's prostitution and poverty; this sequence features dreamy, hallucinogenic camera work that creates a feeling of unease and dislocation. Then, in glorious images of palm tress and fertile land, the film looks at the sugar cane fields in the countryside, and the difficulties faced by peasants working the land. Finally, back in the city again, leftist students battle the police and a corrupt government--and pay a high price for their rebellion.

A university student faces down a crowd of swaggering U.S. sailors and then watches friends shot by police when they try to distribute a pro-Castro leaflet. The war arrives on the doorstep of peasants Mariano, Amelia, and their four children when Batista's forces bomb the hills. Mariano wants peace, so he seeks out the guerrillas to join the fight.

"67","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057809/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","An introductory WWII newsreel sets the stage. D-Day is fast approaching, but the exact date and designated invasion beaches are closely-held secrets. The British Isles are bulging with troops, ships and equipment.The story begins in London on May 31, 1944. An American army major, Jefferson Pike (James Garner), enters Allied Forces HQ to discuss the ongoing invasion preparations. The top brass aren't convinced that Allied deception efforts have fooled the Germans. While poring over a wall map of German troop dispositions in France, Pike inadvertently slides his finger along the edge of the map, incurring a nasty paper cut.To hedge their bets, the High Command sends Pike to Lisbon to meet with a German double agent and see what he knows. Pike expresses concerns that if captured and tortured, he might reveal exact invasion details. His superiors feel that the risk is justified. As Pike flies out of London in civilian garb, a German spy sees him boarding the plane and reports it to her handlers. Another German spy enters his vacant hotel room and gathers personal items, including photos, letters and hair samples from his brush.In Lisbon, Pike goes to a nightclub to meet his contact but quickly realizes that his drink has been drugged shortly before he passes out. He is soon in German hands, placed in a coffin as a deceased German embassy clerk, and flown to Germany. An American-born German army major, Walter Gerber (Rod Taylor), is a military psychiatrist in charge of an elaborate deception scheme designed to coax the invasion secrets from Major Pike. An entire ""American"" military convalescent center has been set up deep in a German forest to fool Pike. Major Gerber is given 36 hours to extract the invasion plans from Pike. After that, Pike will be handed over to the SS to gain the information through their usual means. Gerber also understands that the consequences of failure will be catastrophic for his own future.When a groggy, disoriented Pike finally awakens, he is relieved to find himself in Allied hands. Looking in a mirror for the first time, he is shocked to find his dark hair streaked with gray, his skin aged, and his vision blurry. His every move is observed through a two-way mirror. Piece by piece, Pike is sold the idea that it is now May 1950, the war is long over, and he is convalescing at an American military hospital in occupied Germany. Both Major Gerber and pretty nurse Anna Hedler (Eva Marie Saint) are leading actors in the ruse. Pike's room contains familiar photos and Anna is able to provide accurate details about his parents. Rigorous measures are taken to ensure that Pike is surrounded by dozens of role players who are fluent in American speech dialects and customs. No one is allowed to speak German, even out of Pike's hearing. Pike is told that he is suffering from severe amnesia, a side effect from the severe ""beating"" he supposedly absorbed after the Lisbon incident six years earlier. According to the cover story, Pike was found wandering alone in Lisbon and sent back to the US to recuperate, but continual regressions over the years dictated that he be sent to Major Gerber in Germany for experimental psychological therapy.His nurse tells him that she and Pike have been married for two months, but due to another regression he doesn't remember her. In an unguarded moment with Anna, Pike asks about the war's closing months and mentions something about the invasion sites having been in Normandy. She tries to conceal her shock and reports the sensational disclosure to Major Gerber, who then manages to skillfully extract the most important invasion details from the trusting Pike. The race is on. The date is now June 2.After the session with Gerber, Pike is absent-mindedly rubbing his fingers together when he suddenly irritates the painful paper cut incurred in London two days earlier.

                    Just days prior to the launch of D-Day in June 1944, the Nazis kidnap Maj. Jefferson Pike in Lisbon and transport him to Germany. They have established an elaborate ruse to convince him that it is 1950 and that the war is long over. They have built a replica of an American hospital, staffed it with English-speaking personnel and tell Pike he has been suffering from periodic loss of memory since the war's end. What they really want to learn is where the Allies will launch their assault on Fortress Europe: the Pas de Calais or Normandy. He is initially taken in and gives away the plans for the Normandy invasion. Once he realizes what is happening, he not only has to convince them he was lying the first time around but find a way to escape.

    Synopsis
    An introductory WWII newsreel sets the stage. D-Day is fast approaching, but the exact date and designated invasion beaches are closely-held secrets. The British Isles are bulging with troops, ships and equipment.The story begins in London on May 31, 1944. An American army major, Jefferson Pike (James Garner), enters Allied Forces HQ to discuss the ongoing invasion preparations. The top brass aren't convinced that Allied deception efforts have fooled the Germans. While poring over a wall map of German troop dispositions in France, Pike inadvertently slides his finger along the edge of the map, incurring a nasty paper cut.To hedge their bets, the High Command sends Pike to Lisbon to meet with a German double agent and see what he knows. Pike expresses concerns that if captured and tortured, he might reveal exact invasion details. His superiors feel that the risk is justified. As Pike flies out of London in civilian garb, a German spy sees him boarding the plane and reports it to her handlers. Another German spy enters his vacant hotel room and gathers personal items, including photos, letters and hair samples from his brush.In Lisbon, Pike goes to a nightclub to meet his contact but quickly realizes that his drink has been drugged shortly before he passes out. He is soon in German hands, placed in a coffin as a deceased German embassy clerk, and flown to Germany. An American-born German army major, Walter Gerber (Rod Taylor), is a military psychiatrist in charge of an elaborate deception scheme designed to coax the invasion secrets from Major Pike. An entire ""American"" military convalescent center has been set up deep in a German forest to fool Pike. Major Gerber is given 36 hours to extract the invasion plans from Pike. After that, Pike will be handed over to the SS to gain the information through their usual means. Gerber also understands that the consequences of failure will be catastrophic for his own future.When a groggy, disoriented Pike finally awakens, he is relieved to find himself in Allied hands. Looking in a mirror for the first time, he is shocked to find his dark hair streaked with gray, his skin aged, and his vision blurry. His every move is observed through a two-way mirror. Piece by piece, Pike is sold the idea that it is now May 1950, the war is long over, and he is convalescing at an American military hospital in occupied Germany. Both Major Gerber and pretty nurse Anna Hedler (Eva Marie Saint) are leading actors in the ruse. Pike's room contains familiar photos and Anna is able to provide accurate details about his parents. Rigorous measures are taken to ensure that Pike is surrounded by dozens of role players who are fluent in American speech dialects and customs. No one is allowed to speak German, even out of Pike's hearing. Pike is told that he is suffering from severe amnesia, a side effect from the severe ""beating"" he supposedly absorbed after the Lisbon incident six years earlier. According to the cover story, Pike was found wandering alone in Lisbon and sent back to the US to recuperate, but continual regressions over the years dictated that he be sent to Major Gerber in Germany for experimental psychological therapy.His nurse tells him that she and Pike have been married for two months, but due to another regression he doesn't remember her. In an unguarded moment with Anna, Pike asks about the war's closing months and mentions something about the invasion sites having been in Normandy. She tries to conceal her shock and reports the sensational disclosure to Major Gerber, who then manages to skillfully extract the most important invasion details from the trusting Pike. The race is on. The date is now June 2.After the session with Gerber, Pike is absent-mindedly rubbing his fingers together when he suddenly irritates the painful paper cut incurred in London two days earlier. Gradually recalling the injury, confusion registers on his face. With his suspicions aroused, Pike takes steps to confirm his worst fears and then violently confronts Anna, who admits to the elaborate plot. She explains that she went along with the ruse in order to buy her way out of a concentration camp. Out of hatred for her captors, she agrees to help Pike. He tells her to run out of his room screaming that he has escaped and that he has known about the plot from the outset. Pike slips out the back way, knowing that he will be caught.

The children are spread over Jo's three marriages, with only the youngest being Jake's biological child, although he treats them all as his own. Jo left her second husband Giles after meeting Giles' friend Jake, the two who were immediately attracted to each other. Their upper middle class life is much different than Giles and Jo's, who lived in a barn in the English countryside. But Jo is ruminating about her strained marriage to Jake, with issues on both sides. Jo suspects Jake of chronic infidelity, she only confronting him with her suspicions whenever evidence presents itself. And Jo's psychiatrist believes that Jo uses childbirth as a rationale for sex, which he believes she finds vulgar. These issues in combination have placed Jo in a fragile mental state. They both state that they love the other, but neither really seems to like the other much. As Jake and Jo prepare to move back to the English countryside in a new house within sight of Jo's old barn, both Jo and Jake come to their own unspoken individual conclusions of whether their marriage can withstand these strains, and if so what type of marriage it is destined to be.

But when George overhears Dr. Morrissey talking to George's cardiologist about another patient's terminal heart problem, George assumes they are talking about him and his chest pain. He doesn't plan on telling Judy the news that he's dying, but after seeing that there are things in the world that Judy could not handle on her own, he decides that top on the list of things to do in his remaining two weeks on Earth is to find her a replacement husband as he doesn't want her to fall into the arms of the wrong man. This task is somewhat ironic as George is the jealous type who can't stand to see her with another man. George comes up with a short list of eligible candidates, which he is able to narrow down to one, Bert Power, an oil baron and Judy's college sweetheart, who he admittedly doesn't much like since he's good looking, wealthy and Judy seems to like him a little too much. As George tries to push Judy into Bert's arms, Judy comes to her own wrong conclusions as to why when she sees George with Linda Bullard, a soon to be divorcée with who she thinks he's having an affair. Because of Judy's conclusion, George decides to tell her the truth. But their marriage may not be able to survive Judy eventually finding out directly from Dr. Morrissey that George is indeed not dying, which leads her back to believing that George is cheating on her.

                    American salesman Jack Robinson falls in love with Englishwoman Cynthia Marley and they visit her family so he can ask for permission to marry her. She points out to him that her relatives are rather eccentric and, by the way, a cousin has just died. The remaining members of the clan are; the sinister Reginal; Percival, an inventor who has recently discovered electricity, the phonograph, and several other handy items; Natalia, a macabre, vampire-like creature; Cornwallis, a hammy and dapper ex-actor; Grandfather, who lies bedridden upstairs; and, by the way, Muldoon, who is kept locked up in the fear that he will harm someone. Several attempts are made on his life which leads Jack to believe that the Marleys are a shade past eccentric. He becomes convinced that he is just in the way of one of the Marley's attempts to do away with the other Marleys, especially, during his investigation of the vanishing Marleys, when he learns that the family fortune consists of one million dollars and one of the Marleys intends to end up with all of it. He wants to contact the police but there is no phone or car on the premises.

In the US version they were given American-sounding names. Below they are referred to in their real Italian names.**On a cold dark night a man is seen outside the Four Devils Tavern in London, looking around. Entering, he goes downstairs where Edgar Allan Poe (Silvano Tranquilli) is reciting lines from one of his stories to Lord Thomas Blackwood (Umberto Raho) and the bartender. He listens for a moment, then introduces himself as Alan Foster (Georges Rivière), a reporter who has been trying to get an interview with Poe. Remembering him as having pursued him without response, he invites Foster to sit down. They discuss death and whether there is an afterlife. At one point, Sir Blackwood invites Foster to spend a night in his castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea at Providence. He must remain there from midnight to dawn, upon which he will receive 100 pounds sterling. Refusing the bet at first, Foster offers to try it for 10 pounds. He is told by both Blackwood and Poe that all those who tried before ended up dead. The most recent deaths were a newlywed couple who never returned but are buried in the castle cemetery. Foster agrees and Poe agrees to accompany them to the castle (which is a two-hour ride by carriage) during which he will interview Poe at length.As they arrive at the castle in the middle of the night, Poe asks Foster if he has any second thoughts before he is left alone. Having none, they bid him goodnight saying they will return in the morning. He waves as they leave. Going inside the gates, he wanders through the narrow cemetery. He sees only a black kitten hanging around. As he ascends the steps he finds a woman's garment which he picks up and carries inside with him.Inside he finds an old dusty castle, very dark and dank. Lighting a candelabra, he begins looking round. He hears a noise and goes to an open window. Looking out, he sees nothing and closes it. He taps his cane on an ancient dining table, covered in dust. He sets the candelabra down, removes his cape and hat and places them on the table. Picking up the candelabra, he explores more until he hears a large clock striking eleven. He looks at the grandfather clock, which shows 11:30. The pendulum appears still. As he turns away, he hears the clock strike once more. He looks and sees the pendulum swinging. As he approaches, it stops. He compares the time to that of his pocket watch and sees they are the same.As he looks into another room, he is startled by the image of a man. He goes to investigate and finds a full-length mirror. Tapping on it, he tells himself not to be afraid of his own reflection. He goes on and sees a portrait of Julia Alert (Margrete Robsahm). As he looks again, the portrait seems to be rippling. He tells himself its only a portrait and returns to the table, setting down the candelabra and pulling out note paper and pencil. He tells the portrait that he will make some notes and begins writing.All at once he hears music playing and gets up to see. In another room, he sees a couple dancing but as he approaches the door, it slams shut. Forcing the door open, he finds a dark music room with a harpsichord and harp. He lights a candelabra on the harpsichord, and noticing sheet music there, he sits and begins playing it. Suddenly we see a hand reaching out to touch his shoulder from behind. He is startled and turns to see Elisabeth Blackwood (Barbara Steele) who asks if her brother sent him. Rising, he tells her Lord Blackwood made a bet, but he didn't know anyone else would be in the castle or he wouldn't have accepted the bet. She tells him she fell out with her brother because she was in love with the gardener Herbert (Giovanni Cianfriglia) and Lord Blackwood didn't approve. He tells her he will leave rather than cause her misery, but she insists he stay and win the bet. She says that his room has been prepared. He is surprised and asks how she knew he was coming. She replies that her brother makes the same wager every year on this night and someone comes. As they continue walking, the candles go out just as Elisabeth laughs. He asks who blew them out and she answers only the wind. As they pass by the portrait of Julia, it seems to be rippling again. Elisabeth doesn't see the rippling, but asks about it. Again he tells her he will leave and gather his belongings. She sees the garment he brought in and picks it up, smelling it. He tells her he found it outside.They go upstairs to a bedroom where he sets the candelabra on a desk. Elisabeth sits on the bed and calls him to sit beside her. He comes close and she asks about the world outside. He tells her nothing has changed, but that it is a shame that the world cant share her beauty. She asks him if he finds her attractive and he admits he does. She asks about him and he tells her there is not much to tell. He is single, lonely and works in London as a writer.Suddenly Julia enters the room and says that they have not been introduced. Elisabeth warns Julia not to interfere, telling her that Foster was sent to her by her brother. Julia challenges that, asking Foster if it is true. He says only that he is there because of a wager. Elisabeth tries to get Julia to leave and not to cause any trouble. When she refuses, Elisabeth says that she will leave and does. Julia tells him it is late and that she will also retire. He asks if he will see her in the morning and she tells him no. When he asks if she is leaving, she tells him, no, I only said you wont see me in the daylight. She leaves and he ponders all that was said.Outside in the hall, the two women talk. Elisabeth tells Julia that he belongs to her, that she is in love with him, and they will be happy together. Julia tells her she will not be happy and that he will soon learn the secret of this place. Julia threatens to tell him. Elisabeth is upset and runs off.In his room, Foster removes his coat and looks at a small stack of books on the desk. He picks one up and opens it. The title page reads: CARMUS: ELEMENTS OF METAPHYSICS MEDICINE. He goes to the bed to begin reading, but is distracted by a noise coming from the door. He notices the door handle slowly opening. He rises and gets his derringer and stands by the door. When he pulls the door open, he sees Elisabeth, who says that he is still awake. He invites her in and she goes to the bed, where she sees the book. She says that she will leave, so he can read it. He persuades her to remain, telling her how much he likes her and is attracted to her. She answers that she is pleased to hear this and that she wants his body warmth. She asks him to kiss her and embrace her. They embrace and she begs for his kisses and for him to warm her.Meanwhile Julia is listening outside the door. She remarks to herself that she tried to warn Elisabeth but was unsuccessful. She turns to go and runs into William (Benito Stefanelli) who asks about Elisabeth. Julia tells him she will inform Herbert.Alan and Elisabeth are seen in bed, where he expresses his joy of meeting her. She tells him she cant be part of his world because he is in the present, while hers is in the past. He tells her that he doesn't believe that, resting his head on her chest. As he caresses her arm, he suddenly notices that she has no heartbeat. He looks at her and calls her name. She answers and he tells her that he was afraid her heart had stopped beating. She tells him that her heart has not beaten for ten years since she died.Suddenly Herbert bursts into the room with a knife and stabs Elisabeth. He runs from the room with Alan following. Alan shoots him and he falls. As he watches, the body vanishes. Alan returns to the bedroom to find it empty. He begins calling for Elisabeth, going room to room. All at once he encounters Dr. Carmus (Arturo Dominici), who tells him that he will be unable to find Elisabeth. They go into his study where he offers Alan a drink of whiskey. He explains about the three parts of life. The first part (the weakest) is the human body. Second is the spirit within, and third are the senses, which he explains live on after death in some bodies. Alan scoffs at this and Carmus tells him he will prove it. Removing a small case from a cabinet, he produces a small venomous snake which he puts on a table. Cutting off the head, he tells Alan to note how the body continues moving without the head and the head, though severed from the body is still dangerous enough to bite. Alan says that may be true for reptiles, but he doesn't believe its the same for humans. Carmus takes him to the window, where he points out below the graves of Elisabeth and the others. He tells Alan that tonight they each will live out the last five minutes of their lives until they died.They ascend a staircase and Alan begs for more details about Elisabeth. Suddenly the clock chimes and Carmus tells him that the time is at hand and that words mean nothing. He is told to watch below. The room plays back the evening of a festive party where Elisabeth was dancing with her husband William, who stops and goes to get her a drink. As she waits by a window, Herbert knocks from outside. She opens it and he insists on seeing her. She tells him she will try to see him later and closes the window. Julia sees her talking to Herbert but says nothing. William brings the drink to his wife. Sir Blackwood and his wife approach and inform their hosts they must leave. Escorting them outside, Elisabeth then turns aside to talk to Herbert. He takes her aside into the stable and demands her loyalty, saying that she promised herself to him while her husband was away. Suddenly the dream fades and Carmus tells Alan that their deaths will be replayed tonight, as every year at this time.He takes Alan into the bedroom where William and Elisabeth are in bed together. Herbert comes in and strangles William. He then turns on Elisabeth to kill her, but he is knocked out by Julia with a candlestick. He falls with half his face indented from the blow. Julia turns to comfort Elisabeth, telling her she is now safe. Elisabeth reaches for a knife and stabs Julia. Getting out of bed, Elisabeth views the three dead bodies and screams. Alan says he doesn't want to see anymore, and that it must be a trick. Carmus tells Alan that there is more for him to see.Alan sees that the bedroom is now empty. No bodies are present. He begins searching again, calling for Carmus and Elisabeth. When he reaches the study of Carmus, the door opens and he goes in. Next he sees Carmus, who takes a drink of whiskey. Hearing a banging noise, Carmus takes a candelabra and goes from door to door and window to window until he finds the door that keeps banging open and shut. Opening it, he goes downstairs into the crypt room. He passes by an ornate coffin showing a man and a dog to a stone bier. He slides the cover off to see a decomposed woman inside. As he watches, she begins to breathe, then converts into a mist. Going back to his study, he sits down and begins to write. Suddenly Herbert enters and kills him, then bites to suck blood from his neck. At this point Carmus comes back into the room, telling Alan that he has seen how Carmus met his end. When Alan looks at the desk again, no one is there. He picks up the paper Carmus wrote on and reads: Blood is the fountain of life; only blood brings back the dead to life; we will drink from this fountain!!Alan hears ghostly laughter and pulls out his derringer. Realizing the gun will do no good, he drops in on the desk and exits the study. Soon he hears more laughter from outside. As the front door opens, he hides to watch. The bride (Sylvia Sorrente) and groom enter to spend their wedding night.As they go upstairs, Alan calls out to them to warn them they are going to their deaths, but realizes they cant hear him and there is nothing he can do but watch. He notices the door standing open and goes to it. It closes and he tries to open it, but the handle breaks off. He realizes he is trapped. He begins calling out loud, hoping Carmus can set him free while he is still alive.Upstairs, the amorous couple is kissing but hears a noise. He goes to investigate and she begins to undress by the fire. As she gazes at her reflection in the mirror, we see Herbert approach from behind. Seeing him, she screams as he attacks. Her husband rushes in to find Elsi dead, and is killed by Herbert. The scene vanishes and Alan sees the couple approaching him. They tell him it is now his turn. He runs downstairs and sees Carmus, who tells him that he is next. He tries to run, but each of them are closing in on him. All at once he sees Elisabeth, who tells him which way to run. She says they need his blood to be able to live again next year for a few minutes.Alan runs down a hall and is trapped as the others approach. At the last second, Elisabeth opens a door and leads him through. Again she tells him they need his blood but if he can escape they will die. He tells her to come with him, grabbing her arm. She cries no, that she cannot enter his world. He insists, pulling her along through corridors. She continues to tell him that she cant come with him because she is dead. Finally they go outside where she collapses, telling him goodbye. Her body deteriorates completely away until she is only dust. He stumbles through the graveyard, hearing the voices of the others calling him. As he comes under the tree with the low branches, he sees the bodies of the others hanging from high limbs. They all tell him there is no escape and they will live by his blood. He makes it to the gate and steps outside, thinking he is safe. Suddenly the gate closes and a metal rod pierces him through, killing him and holding his body upright.The next morning Poe and Blackwood arrive in their carriage and Poe remarks how he is standing there. But when they approach they see he is dead. Blackwood takes money from Alans wallet, telling Poe he must collect on the debt. Blackwood says he will arrange for burial in the cemetery. Poe says he can now write the story, but no one will believe it.The voices of Elisabeth and Alan are heard talking to each other. She says you stayed with me, Alan. He replies: yes, Elisabeth.","

                    ""Special friendships"" are youthful relationships with homoerotic overtones, and this film explores them in the setting of a strict French Roman Catholic boys' boarding school in the 1920s. The faculty are ever alert, depriving the students of all privacy. When a vulnerable fifteen-year old boy, motivated variously by jealousy, subservience and fear, or genuine good intentions, co-operates with his teachers' campaigns to repress all suggestion of romance or impropriety in his own and others' friendships, he betrays everyone most important to him. Based on the novel ""Les Amities Particulieres"" by Roger Peyrefitte.

"89","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058383/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film opens with a droll series of silent bits as a constable at night on his bicycle discovers a man with his hands on a rope with a strangled woman -- Margaret McGinty -- attached. As it happens Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) is on the jury in the succeeding murder trial. She forces a mistrial as the only one to hold out in a seemingly open and shut case because she views the evidence as circumstantial. She then enlists the aid of her friend Mr. Stringer (Stringer Davis, Rutherford's actual husband) to follow the evidence in support of her theory to find the real murderer. She is harassed by Detective Inspector Craddock (Charles ""Bud"" Tingwell) who wants her to get out of the way of the Police. She traces the evidence to a low-rent theatre troupe run by H. Driffold Cosgood (Ron Moody), and manages to infiltrate the acting company with a whirling rendition of The Shooting of Dan McGrew, and intimating that she may be willing to financially subsidize the company.No sooner does she secure a place as an actress, than one of the actors, George, drops dead from poisoning and Detective Inspector Craddock shows up again to try to get her to give up her hunt, but does also work with her to discover the killer. She suggests that Craddock investigate bank accounts of all the actors to see who, if any, recently withdrew 100 pounds -- the amount of cash found surrounding the body of Mrs. McGinty and now believed to be a pay off for black mail. Back at the boarding house where all the actors are staying, Miss Marple continues to ferret out clues and finds a note outside her door telling her to meet someone at 1AM in the kitchen if she wants to find out more. As she is sneaking down the stairs, she sees middle-aged actress Dorothy sneaking down just ahead of her and follows. When she opens the closed kitchen door, Dorothy is dead on the floor and Mrs. Marple, smelling bitter almonds indicating cyanide, throws open the outside door and windows. When the inspector arrives, she explains that the murder was done in a complicated way involving an on/off stove timer, a pot containing candle wax and a cyanide capsule but says this was the murder method of the play that they are opening with the following week (""Out of the Stewpot""), so all the actors would know how to do this. Meanwhile, Mr. Stringer arrives and tells her that the police have learned that one of the actors DID withdraw 100 pounds recently, but it was the recently-murdered George. Inspector Craddock theorizes that George had been blackmailing Margaret McGinty, which is why he withdrew the 100 pounds from his account, and then, in a fit of remorse, killed himself, but Mrs. Marple thinks otherwise.Mrs. Marple visits a theatrical agent who tells her that Margaret McGinty was in a 1951 play, ""Forever September"", written by Mr. Cosgood, along with a Rose Kane, who had a child about eleven. The agent says that Rose Kane was hanged for poisoning her husband, and Margaret McGinty, took the child in for awhile but that eventually it was sent on to an orphanage. He can't remember the sex of the child, but does recall the name, ""Evelyn"" pronounced ""EEvelyn"". This child would now be about the age of the four younger members of the acting troupe, Eva, Bill, Sheila, and Arthur.As the play opens the next week, the police are on hand to protect Mrs. Marple, but Eva comes into her dressing room with a knife and together they go below stage where Mrs. Marple learns that Eva thinks that Mrs. Marple was involved in killing George, who, it turns out, was her lover. Just as Mrs. Marple talks Eva out of her ill-conceived murder plan, the real murderer comes out of the shadows causing Eva to drop her knife and run away in fear. The shadowy figure is revealed to be Bill Hanson. Bill explains that in the play he is in a closet and he has used the stage trap door to come down and will be able to murder Mrs. Marple, and return to his closet before his scene takes place in 3 minutes. Bill, is actually Evelyn Kane, and he murdered Margaret McGinty because she was going to reveal to his soon-to-be father-in-law Bill's mother's sordid past. He picks up Eva's knife (he had intended to strangle Mrs. Marple) but Mrs. Marple draws the revolver that is to be used in the play (she had replaced it with a banana), and points it at Bill explaining she has replaced the blanks with real ammunition. She announces she was a former pistol champion at Bisley but he still advances on her so she shoots in two a prop rope causing a heavy wooden wheel to fall and knock out Bill, but also Inspector Craddock who had rushed downstairs. At the same time, Mr. Cosgood steps into the open stage door and comes crashing down. As she looks around at the three unconscious men, she says ""Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear"". The movie ends with her visiting Cosgood and Inspector Craddock in hospital, where he announced he has been promoted to Chief Inspector.

                    Although the evidence appears to be overwhelming in the strangulation murder of a blackmailer, Miss Marple's sole 'not guilty' vote hangs the jury 11-1. She becomes convinced that the real murderer is a member of a local theatrical troupe, so she joins them in order to gather information. The clues lead back many years to a single disastrously unsuccessful 1951 performance of a dreadful play written by the group's hammy director, H. Driffold Cosgood. Although at that time, several of the current cast members were only children, more murders follow before Miss Marple ultimately exposes the killer.

    Synopsis
    The film opens with a droll series of silent bits as a constable at night on his bicycle discovers a man with his hands on a rope with a strangled woman -- Margaret McGinty -- attached. As it happens Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) is on the jury in the succeeding murder trial. She forces a mistrial as the only one to hold out in a seemingly open and shut case because she views the evidence as circumstantial. She then enlists the aid of her friend Mr. Stringer (Stringer Davis, Rutherford's actual husband) to follow the evidence in support of her theory to find the real murderer. She is harassed by Detective Inspector Craddock (Charles ""Bud"" Tingwell) who wants her to get out of the way of the Police. She traces the evidence to a low-rent theatre troupe run by H. Driffold Cosgood (Ron Moody), and manages to infiltrate the acting company with a whirling rendition of The Shooting of Dan McGrew, and intimating that she may be willing to financially subsidize the company.No sooner does she secure a place as an actress, than one of the actors, George, drops dead from poisoning and Detective Inspector Craddock shows up again to try to get her to give up her hunt, but does also work with her to discover the killer. She suggests that Craddock investigate bank accounts of all the actors to see who, if any, recently withdrew 100 pounds -- the amount of cash found surrounding the body of Mrs. McGinty and now believed to be a pay off for black mail. Back at the boarding house where all the actors are staying, Miss Marple continues to ferret out clues and finds a note outside her door telling her to meet someone at 1AM in the kitchen if she wants to find out more. As she is sneaking down the stairs, she sees middle-aged actress Dorothy sneaking down just ahead of her and follows. When she opens the closed kitchen door, Dorothy is dead on the floor and Mrs. Marple, smelling bitter almonds indicating cyanide, throws open the outside door and windows. When the inspector arrives, she explains that the murder was done in a complicated way involving an on/off stove timer, a pot containing candle wax and a cyanide capsule but says this was the murder method of the play that they are opening with the following week (""Out of the Stewpot""), so all the actors would know how to do this.
