The opening shots show Xanadu, Kane's vast, elaborate, and now unkempt estate in Florida. Interspersed with segments of his newsreel obituary are scenes from his life and death. Most puzzling are his last moments: clutching a snowglobe, he mutters the word ""rosebud."" Kane, whose life was news and whose newspapers not only reported but formed public opinion, was central to his time, a larger-than-life figure. The newsreel editor feels that until they know who or what Rosebud is they won't have the whole story on Kane. He assigns a reporter called Thompson (William Alland) to investigate Rosebud.Thompson digs into Kane's life and hears a lot of stories, but none of them reveal the meaning of Rosebud. The reporter sees Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), the tycoon's ex-wife; she's drunk and won't speak to him. Then he reads the unpublished memoirs of Mr. Thatcher (George Coulouris), Kane's early financial adviser and childhood guardian, who later became a prime target of the Kane newspapers' trust-busting attacks. In one of many flashbacks, the Thatcher memoir shows Kane's mother signing guardianship of the boy and his fortune over to Thatcher, despite his father's objections. When Charles objected violently to being sent away with Thatcher, Kane Sr. remarked, ""what the kid needs is a good thrashing."" Mrs. Kane responded, ""That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him."" (Some present-day fans of the film interpret this to mean that Mr. Kane was abusive. 1940s audiences were more likely to have believed that Mrs. Kane was over-protective and that if Charles had been allowed to grow up enjoying the love and discipline of his parents, his life would have turned out better.)Years later, as he was about to get control of his business affairs, Kane's interest in newspapers was piqued when he noticed that he owned the struggling New York Daily Inquirer. Don't sell it, he famously wrote to Thatcher: ""I think it would be fun to run a newspaper"" -- a statement that exasperates Thatcher greatly. That exasperation grows even more when Kane's paper starts attacking Thatcher's traction interests as corrupt and they suffer as a result. Thatcher confronted Kane at the Inquirer to talk him out attacking businesses that Kane himself owns considerable stock in as well as throwing so much money away on low-class journalism such as instigating the Spanish-American War. However, Kane defiantly told Thatcher that he wanted to use journalism to protect the interests of ordinary people from the likes of Thatcher and intended to use his personal resources to keep the newspaper running at an annual million dollar loss for 60 years if necessary. The scene shifts to an office at a time considerably sooner than 60 years later in which Kane's bankrupted media empire is placed under the control of Thatcher. Thatcher even-handedly noted that while Kane would still be richer than him, his former ward never made significant investments with his money, but instead squandered much of it in buying things. Kane ruefully speculated that if he not been so rich, he might have become a great man to become everything Thatcher hates.Next, Thompson interviews Bernstein (Everett Sloane), the general manager of Kane's newspaper empire. In further flashbacks, Bernstein recalls how he, Kane, and Kane's college friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) took over the stuffy, unprofitable Inquirer and transformed it into a money-maker, eventually hiring the staff of the rival New York Chronicle.At Bernstein's urging, Thompson seeks out Leland, who recounts the story of Kane's first marriage (to Emily Norton, Ruth Warrick) and makes some negative comments about his one-time friend's character. (""Charlie was never brutal, he just did brutal things."" ""He married for love -- that's why he did everything. That's why he went into politics. It seems we weren't enough. He wanted all the voters to love him, too. All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story -- it's the story of how he lost it. You see, he just didn't have any to give."" ""He never believed in anything except Charlie Kane."")Leland goes on to describe Kane's second marriage, to Susan Alexander. Kane started seeing her while he was still married to Emily, during his campaign for governor. He ran on an anti-corruption platform, promising to investigate and bring down his opponent, political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins). Gettys found out about Susan and threatened to tell the press unless Kane withdrew from the race. Kane refused, the story came out, and he lost the election along with his first marriage. In the immediate aftermath of that defeat, Leland, drunkenly incensed at Kane humiliating his family and then treating the public's political rejection of him as if they were his serfs, ask to be transferred to the Chicago newspaper to get away from him. He married Susan (who the non-Kane newspapers describe disparagingly as 'a ""singer""') soon after his divorce from Emily was final.Although her singing talent was modest, Kane was ambitious on his wife's behalf. He paid for voice lessons, built an opera house in Chicago (""Cost: three million dollars!"" the obituary reel notes), and financed an elaborate production for her debut. (The work Susan stars in is identified as Salammbo in the newspaper coverage, but it's a fictionalized version -- the music was written specially for Citizen Kane.) At the opening night performance, which was poorly received by the audience to the point where Kane is quickly left alone applauding his wife's performance. Kane arrived at the offices of the Chicago Inquirer to find Leland drunk again and passed out over his typewriter, his cheek resting on his unfinished -- and very negative -- review of Susan's performance. Kane finished the review in the same negative vein and ran it in all his papers, but fired Leland. Susan wanted to quit, but Kane insisted she keep performing until a suicide attempt convinced him she needed to give up singing. (By this time Thompson is interviewing Susan herself.)The couple moved to Florida and Kane went to work on Xanadu (""Cost: no man knows""), where most of the remaining scenes are set. Kane's 49,000-acre ""private pleasure ground,"" ostensibly built for Susan, includes a man-made mountain, a golf course, vast gardens, a zoo, and, of course, a mansion. In a huge, echoing, and nearly empty stone hall, Susan did jigsaw puzzles and longed to be in New York. Kane declined to leave Xanadu, but did arrange an event he called a picnic, involving an overnight stay in the Everglades, a large animal spit-roasted over a fire, richly furnished tents, musicians, and many guests. In their tent, Susan accused him of trying to buy love, despite never loving anyone but himself, and of never giving her anything that mattered; he slapped her. Shortly thereafter she left him. She almost wavered in her resolve to go when he begged her not to, saying she'd have everything her own way. However, he then turned the emphasis back on himself, saying ""you can't do this to me."" At that, Susan angrily realized the inherent selfishness behind that statement and defiantly walked out on him.From the Kanes' butler Raymond (Paul Stewart), Thompson hears how Kane trashed Susan's room after she left but stopped when he came across the snowglobe (which we recognize from the deathbed scene). As Kane pocketed the snowglobe, Raymond heard him say ""rosebud."" Raymond has no idea what it means. However, he tells Thompson that he was in the room to hear Kane say ""rosebud"" again just before he died.In Xanadu's big stone hall, the reporters are getting ready to leave. The place is jammed with packing crates full of art and household goods, some valuable, some not. (There's a shot of all the crates that's a clear ancestor of the warehouse shot at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark.) Thompson explains to the other reporters that he never found the meaning of Rosebud, but that it doesn't matter. ""I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life.""The camera pans across the crates and finds the sled that Kane played with in the scene where his parents turned him over to Thatcher; the word Rosebud is stenciled on it. In the final scene, men are tossing trash into an incinerator. Raymond says, ""Throw that junk in, too,"" and in goes the sled Rosebud, probably the only thing that always stayed with Kane.""He was a man who got everything and then again lost everything, Rosebud must've been something he lost or something he wanted but never got"". The flames consume it. In an exterior shot, the camera pulls back from the smoking chimney to the chain-link fence with the ""No trespassing"" sign with which the movie opened, and then to Xanadu's ""K"" gate.","
    
                    A group of reporters are trying to decipher the last word ever spoken by Charles Foster Kane, the millionaire newspaper tycoon: ""Rosebud."" The film begins with a news reel detailing Kane's life for the masses, and then from there, we are shown flashbacks from Kane's life. As the reporters investigate further, the viewers see a display of a fascinating man's rise to fame, and how he eventually fell off the top of the world.

The featured players are shown with the actor's name and character's name. We zoom in on a shelf of books. An encyclopedia is opened to the article on Lycanthropy. Talbot Castle is mentioned in the old legend.The chauffeur (an uncredited Eric Wilton) drives Lawrence Stewart Talbot, known affectionately, as Larry (Lon Chaney, Jr.) to the family home, Talbot Castle. He is greeted, very formally, by his father, Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains). They enter a large room and Larry is introduced to Captain Paul Montford (Ralph Bellamy), the chief constable of the district. Larry expresses his sorrow over the death of his older brother, and heir to the family estate, John. Sir John apologizes for being so distant. Larry has been away for eighteen years. Two butlers enter the room carrying a large crate: a part for the telescope. Sir John and Larry walk up to the attic, now serving as an observatory. Larry works on the telescope, having worked for an optical company in California. He proudly explains one job was on the Mt. Wilson observatory. Larry trains his telescope on the town below and spots Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers) in her room putting on earrings. He takes a trip to Conliffe's antique shop hoping to meet Gwen in person. He does and asks for earrings as a gift. Larry asks for a very specific pair, then tells Gwen she has a pair up in her room. He decides to buy a cane. Larry grabs one with a silver wolf's head and jokes that it would make a good golf putter. Larry is trying to be charming, but balks at paying three pounds until Gwen explains, ""Well, that's a very rare piece. It shows the wolf and the pentagram, the sign of the werewolf."" She tells him a bit of the legend. She recites the old poem, ""Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms, and the autumn moon is bright."" A noise outside draws Gwen to the street outside. An old gypsy woman, Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya) and her son Bela (Bela Lugosi) are riding into town with their cart and wagon.Larry returns to the house and asks his father about the legend. Sir John repeats the poem which leads the conversation to Gwen. Sir John encourages Larry to get to know the townsfolk. Gwen exits the shop that evening, and at the appointed time, Larry arrives. Gwen introduces Jenny Williams (Fay Helm). So Larry is resigned to a three-person date. Jenny sees wolfbane blooming and gathers some, reciting the poem. The three enter the gypsy camp. Bela greets them. They've come to have their fortunes told. Jenny insists on having her fortune told first. Maleva stares at Gwen and Larry, and then enters her tent. Bela tells Jenny to cut the cards. Larry and Gwen go off for a walk. Larry admits he watched her through his telescope. Gwen has an admission of her own, she's engaged to be married soon. Bela arranges the cards and stares at the flowers. Annoyed, Bela throws the flowers off the table and brushes his hair aside. There is a pentagram star on his forehead. Jenny demands to know what Bela saw in the cards. Bela asks for her hands, the left shows the past and the right shows the future. Bela sees the pentagram in a circle on her right hand: the next victim of the werewolf. Bela is now in a panic and demands Jenny leave, and quickly. Jenny runs through the woods, Larry and Gwen hear a wolf howl. Jenny screams and Larry runs off to help her. He sees a wolf attacking Jenny. The wolf turns on Larry and they struggle. He beats the animal with his cane, using the silver wolf's head to kill the beast. Larry was bitten in the struggle and staggers away. Gwen finds Larry and calls for help from Maleva who is passing in her cart. Maleva agrees to help and take him home to the castle.The butler, Kendall (an uncredited Leyland Hodgson), goes to the door and admits Larry, Gwen and Maleva. Gwen and the butler help Larry to an entry table. Maleva makes a quiet exit. A villager reports the death of Jenny, and Montford leaves with the man to investigate. Sir John and the butler take Larry upstairs to his room. A doctor is called. Twiddle (Forrester Harvey) takes notes as Montford dictates. Dr. Lloyd (Warren William) examines Jenny's remains and his observations are added to the notes. Frank Andrews (Patric Knowles) finds the body of Bela near Jenny. Larry's cane is found next to Bela's body.Larry wakes in his bedroom in Talbot Castle. Sir John, Dr. Lloyd and Montford enter the room. Montford asks Larry if the cane his is holding belongs to Larry. Larry says, ""Why, of course. That's the one I killed the wolf with."" Sir John tells his son that Bela the gypsy was killed and his cane was found near the body. The bite marks are gone. Sir John has an explanation for the scene of the crime and the doctor agrees, but Montford is not satisfied.In town, Larry is present when Bela's casket is brought into the church for services. Larry enters the church. Before he can open the lid and examine the body, the minister and Maleva enter the church. The minister is upset at the pending pagan celebration for Bela. Maleva opens the casket and recites, ""The way you walked was thorny, through no fault of your own. But as the rain enters the soil, the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end. Your suffering is over, Bela, my son. Now you will find peace.""Charles Conliffe (J.M. Kerrigan) reassures his daughter, Gwen, that there is nothing the authorities can accuse her of. Gwen is still upset over Jenny's death. Jenny's mother, Mrs. Williams (an uncredited Doris Lloyd), along with other women of the village, confront Mr. Conliffe over Gwen's involvement in her daughter's death. Things escalate and Conliffe demands they all leave. Larry enters the shop and confronts the women. They exit in a hurry. Larry enters the parlor to talk to Gwen. She wants to know exactly what happened. Frank Andrews enters the shop with his dog. He walks to the parlor to talk to Gwen and Larry. The dog begins to bark at Larry. Gwen suggests her fiancé take the dog outside. Gwen and Larry discuss Frank while he is attending to his dog. Gwen explains that Frank is the gamekeeper on Sir John's estate. Larry extends his hand to Andrews, but Frank just stares at his hand, but does not shake it. Larry excuses himself. Gwen asks, ""Frank, why were you so rude?"" He explains he was mesmerized by the walking stick, and adds, ""Well, there's something very tragic about that man. I'm sure that nothing but harm will come to you through him.""Gwen and Frank attend the gypsy carnival and celebration for Bela. Larry shows up to watch the dancing. The three walk over to the target shooting booth. Larry does well with the rifle until a wolf figure pops up on the board. Larry walks over to the encampment. Maleva is there and wants to talk. She tells him she expected him sooner. Larry and Maleva enter the tent. She tells Larry that the wolf was Bela. She explains, ""Bela became a wolf, and you killed him. A werewolf can be killed only with a silver bullet, or a silver knife, or a stick with a silver handle."" Larry insists he killed an ordinary wolf. Maleva gives him a charm with a pentagram on it. She tells him, ""It can break the evil spell."" Maleva recites another section of the legend, ""Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives, becomes a werewolf himself."" Larry admits the wolf bit him. Maleva places the charm around Larry's neck and tells him to keep it on and over his heart, always. She asks to see the wound. Larry runs off, and Montford sees Maleva exit her tent. The word is spread amongst the gypsies and they break camp and prepare to leave the area.Larry bumps into Gwen. She and Frank had a quarrel so Larry volunteers to walk her home. She asks about the curious charm. He divulges that he is now a werewolf and gives Gwen the charm for her protection. Larry steals a kiss, but the noise of the gypsies scares Gwen off. One gypsy tells Larry they are frightened because there is a werewolf in camp. Larry reflects on the events of the past and runs home. In his room, Larry checks himself for any physical changes. He removes his shoes and one sock. To his horror his leg and foot are covered with tufts of hair. He removes the other sock and both feet and legs are now covered with a thick matting of long hair. The feet transform to animal paws. Larry stands and walks on his toes. He finds himself outside, prowling around the cemetery. His hands are now claws, and his face is dark and hairy.

Montford concludes, ""The wolf must have attacked her, and Larry came to the rescue. I'm sorry, Sir John."" We close with Gwen in Andrews arms. She says, Larry!","

    Synopsis
    The 1941 version of the Wolf Man opens with the Universal Picture airplane and globe logo and theme, followed by title and credits. The featured players are shown with the actor's name and character's name. We zoom in on a shelf of books. An encyclopedia is opened to the article on Lycanthropy. Talbot Castle is mentioned in the old legend.The chauffeur (an uncredited Eric Wilton) drives Lawrence Stewart Talbot, known affectionately, as Larry (Lon Chaney, Jr.) to the family home, Talbot Castle. He is greeted, very formally, by his father, Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains). They enter a large room and Larry is introduced to Captain Paul Montford (Ralph Bellamy), the chief constable of the district. Larry expresses his sorrow over the death of his older brother, and heir to the family estate, John. Sir John apologizes for being so distant. Larry has been away for eighteen years. Two butlers enter the room carrying a large crate: a part for the telescope. Sir John and Larry walk up to the attic, now serving as an observatory. Larry works on the telescope, having worked for an optical company in California. He proudly explains one job was on the Mt. Wilson observatory. Larry trains his telescope on the town below and spots Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers) in her room putting on earrings. He takes a trip to Conliffe's antique shop hoping to meet Gwen in person. He does and asks for earrings as a gift. Larry asks for a very specific pair, then tells Gwen she has a pair up in her room. He decides to buy a cane. Larry grabs one with a silver wolf's head and jokes that it would make a good golf putter. Larry is trying to be charming, but balks at paying three pounds until Gwen explains, ""Well, that's a very rare piece. It shows the wolf and the pentagram, the sign of the werewolf."" She tells him a bit of the legend. She recites the old poem, ""Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms, and the autumn moon is bright."" A noise outside draws Gwen to the street outside. An old gypsy woman, Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya) and her son Bela (Bela Lugosi) are riding into town with their cart and wagon.Larry returns to the house and asks his father about the legend. Sir John repeats the poem which leads the conversation to Gwen. Sir John encourages Larry to get to know the townsfolk. Gwen exits the shop that evening, and at the appointed time, Larry arrives. Gwen introduces Jenny Williams (Fay Helm). So Larry is resigned to a three-person date. Jenny sees wolfbane blooming and gathers some, reciting the poem. The three enter the gypsy camp. Bela greets them. They've come to have their fortunes told. Jenny insists on having her fortune told first. Maleva stares at Gwen and Larry, and then enters her tent. Bela tells Jenny to cut the cards. Larry and Gwen go off for a walk. Larry admits he watched her through his telescope. Gwen has an admission of her own, she's engaged to be married soon. Bela arranges the cards and stares at the flowers. Annoyed, Bela throws the flowers off the table and brushes his hair aside. There is a pentagram star on his forehead. Jenny demands to know what Bela saw in the cards. Bela asks for her hands, the left shows the past and the right shows the future. Bela sees the pentagram in a circle on her right hand: the next victim of the werewolf. Bela is now in a panic and demands Jenny leave, and quickly. Jenny runs through the woods, Larry and Gwen hear a wolf howl. Jenny screams and Larry runs off to help her. He sees a wolf attacking Jenny. The wolf turns on Larry and they struggle. He beats the animal with his cane, using the silver wolf's head to kill the beast. Larry was bitten in the struggle and staggers away. Gwen finds Larry and calls for help from Maleva who is passing in her cart. Maleva agrees to help and take him home to the castle.The butler, Kendall (an uncredited Leyland Hodgson), goes to the door and admits Larry, Gwen and Maleva. Gwen and the butler help Larry to an entry table. Maleva makes a quiet exit. A villager reports the death of Jenny, and Montford leaves with the man to investigate. Sir John and the butler take Larry upstairs to his room. A doctor is called. Twiddle (Forrester Harvey) takes notes as Montford dictates. Dr. Lloyd (Warren William) examines Jenny's remains and his observations are added to the notes. Frank Andrews (Patric Knowles) finds the body of Bela near Jenny. Larry's cane is found next to Bela's body.Larry wakes in his bedroom in Talbot Castle. Sir John, Dr. Lloyd and Montford enter the room. Montford asks Larry if the cane his is holding belongs to Larry. Larry says, ""Why, of course. That's the one I killed the wolf with."" Sir John tells his son that Bela the gypsy was killed and his cane was found near the body. The bite marks are gone. Sir John has an explanation for the scene of the crime and the doctor agrees, but Montford is not satisfied.In town, Larry is present when Bela's casket is brought into the church for services. Larry enters the church. Before he can open the lid and examine the body, the minister and Maleva enter the church. The minister is upset at the pending pagan celebration for Bela. Maleva opens the casket and recites, ""The way you walked was thorny, through no fault of your own. But as the rain enters the soil, the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end. Your suffering is over, Bela, my son. Now you will find peace.""Charles Conliffe (J.M. Kerrigan) reassures his daughter, Gwen, that there is nothing the authorities can accuse her of. Gwen is still upset over Jenny's death. Jenny's mother, Mrs. Williams (an uncredited Doris Lloyd), along with other women of the village, confront Mr. Conliffe over Gwen's involvement in her daughter's death. Things escalate and Conliffe demands they all leave. Larry enters the shop and confronts the women. They exit in a hurry. Larry enters the parlor to talk to Gwen. She wants to know exactly what happened. Frank Andrews enters the shop with his dog. He walks to the parlor to talk to Gwen and Larry. The dog begins to bark at Larry. Gwen suggests her fiancé take the dog outside. Gwen and Larry discuss Frank while he is attending to his dog. Gwen explains that Frank is the gamekeeper on Sir John's estate. Larry extends his hand to Andrews, but Frank just stares at his hand, but does not shake it. Larry excuses himself. Gwen asks, ""Frank, why were you so rude?"" He explains he was mesmerized by the walking stick, and adds, ""Well, there's something very tragic about that man. I'm sure that nothing but harm will come to you through him.""Gwen and Frank attend the gypsy carnival and celebration for Bela. Larry shows up to watch the dancing. The three walk over to the target shooting booth. Larry does well with the rifle until a wolf figure pops up on the board. Larry walks over to the encampment. Maleva is there and wants to talk. She tells him she expected him sooner. Larry and Maleva enter the tent. She tells Larry that the wolf was Bela. She explains, ""Bela became a wolf, and you killed him. A werewolf can be killed only with a silver bullet, or a silver knife, or a stick with a silver handle."" Larry insists he killed an ordinary wolf. Maleva gives him a charm with a pentagram on it. She tells him, ""It can break the evil spell."" Maleva recites another section of the legend, ""Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives, becomes a werewolf himself."" Larry admits the wolf bit him. Maleva places the charm around Larry's neck and tells him to keep it on and over his heart, always. She asks to see the wound. Larry runs off, and Montford sees Maleva exit her tent. The word is spread amongst the gypsies and they break camp and prepare to leave the area.Larry bumps into Gwen. She and Frank had a quarrel so Larry volunteers to walk her home. She asks about the curious charm. He divulges that he is now a werewolf and gives Gwen the charm for her protection. Larry steals a kiss, but the noise of the gypsies scares Gwen off. One gypsy tells Larry they are frightened because there is a werewolf in camp. Larry reflects on the events of the past and runs home. In his room, Larry checks himself for any physical changes. He removes his shoes and one sock. To his horror his leg and foot are covered with tufts of hair. He removes the other sock and both feet and legs are now covered with a thick matting of long hair. The feet transform to animal paws. Larry stands and walks on his toes. He finds himself outside, prowling around the cemetery. His hands are now claws, and his face is dark and hairy. He sports sharp, long, canine teeth. Richardson, the gravedigger (an uncredited Tom Stevenson) is finishing up Jenny Williams grave and spots the Wolf Man.

"4","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033870/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Private eye Sam Spade and his partner Miles Archer are approached by Miss Wonderly to follow a man, Floyd Thursby, who allegedly ran off with her younger sister. The two accept the assignment because the money is good, but Spade also implies that the woman looks like trouble, though she projects wholesome innocence.That night, Detective Tom Polhaus informs Spade that Archer has been shot and killed while tailing Thursby. Even later that night, two officers visit Spade at his apartment and inquire about Spade's whereabouts in the last few hours. Spade asks what the visit is really about. The officers say that Thursby was also killed and that Spade is a suspect, since Thursby likely killed Archer. They have no evidence against Spade at the moment, but tell him that they will be conducting an investigation into the matter.The next day, Spade gets a visit from Archer's wife, with whom he has been having an affair. The widow asks Spade if he killed Miles so that they could be together. Spade dismisses her and tells her to leave, and coldly orders his secretary Effie to remove all of Archer's belongings from the office. He then goes to a new address left in a note from his client, whose name he learns is Brigid O'Shaughnessy. He also finds out that Brigid never had a sister, and Thursby was her acquaintance who had betrayed her.Later, Spade is visited by another man, Joel Cairo, who offers Spade $5000 if the private eye can retrieve a figurine of a black bird that has recently arrived. While Spade has no idea what the man is talking about, he plays along. Suddenly, Cairo pulls a gun on Spade, and declares his intention to search Spade's office. But when he approaches Spade to search his person, Spade disarms him and knocks him unconscious. After cataloguing Cairo's belongings and questioning him in return, Spade returns Cairo's firearm and allows the man to search his office. Following this, Spade is again contacted by Brigid O'Shaughnessy. She offers her sympathies for the death of his partner. Spade senses a connection between O'Shaughnessy and Cairo, and casually mentions that Cairo has contacted him. O'Shaughnessy gets extremely nervous when she hears this. She tells Spade that she must meet with Cairo, and asks Spade to arrange a meeting. Spade agrees.When Cairo and Brigid O'Shaughnessy meet, they make references that the reader and Spade don't initially comprehend. Cairo says he is ready to pay for the black figurine. Brigid O'Shaughnessy, however, says she does not have it at the moment. They also refer to a mysterious figure, ""G"" (""the fat man"" in the film), whom they seem to be scared of. The two then continue to talk about some events that happened overseas. Eventually, O'Shaughnessy insinuates that Cairo is a homosexual, and Cairo insinuates that O'Shaughnessy simply uses her body to get what she wants, and the two begin to fight. At this point, the police show up, coincidentally, to talk to Spade. Spade greets them at the door, but refuses to let them in. The officers say they know Spade was having an affair with Archer's wife; just as they are about to leave, they hear Cairo screaming for help. They force their way into Spade's apartment, and Spade invents a story that involves describing how Cairo and O'Shaughnessy were just play-acting. The officers seem to accept, if not believe, Spade's story, but they take Cairo with them down to the station for some ""grilling"". Spade sends Brigid to stay with Effie, where she will be safe.The next morning, Spade makes his way to the hotel where Cairo is staying. Cairo shows up disheveled, saying that he was held in police custody through the night. Meanwhile, Spade notices that he's being tailed by some kid named Wilmer Cook. He confronts the gunsel[1], and tells him that both he and his boss, ""G,"" will have to deal with him at some point. He later receives a call from Casper Gutman, who wishes to meet with him. Gutman, a huge person weighing over 300 lbs, says he will pay handsomely for the black bird. Spade implies that he can get the item (though at this point this is a bluff), but wants to know what it is first.Gutman tells him that the figurine was a gift from the Island of Malta to the King of Spain a few hundred years ago, but was lost on ship in transit. It was covered with fine jewels, but acquired a layer of black enamel at some time, to conceal its value (estimated to be in the millions). Gutman learned of its whereabouts seventeen years ago, and has been looking for it ever since. He traced it to the home of a Russian General, then sent three of his 'agents' (Cairo, Thursby and Brigid O'Shaughnessy) to get it. The latter supposedly did retrieve the figurine, but learned of its value and decided to keep it for themselves. Spade starts to get dizzy at this point (Gutman has drugged him), and when he goes to leave, Wilmer trips him and knocks him out by kicking his temple.When Spade awakens, he returns to his office and tells the story of the Maltese Falcon to Effie. Soon afterwards, an injured man, identified as Captain Jacobi of ""La Paloma,"" shows up at the office; he drops a package on the floor and then dies of gunshot wounds. Spade opens the package, and finds the figurine falcon. Sam is called away from the office. To prevent losing the item, Spade stores the package at a bus station lost luggage counter and mails himself the collection tag. He first goes to the dock where ""La Paloma"" was anchored, but learns that a fire had been started on board. He then proceeds to the place Rhea Gutman said she was when she phoned earlier. There he finds a drugged-up, seventeen-year old girl, her stomach all scratched up by a pin in attempts to keep herself awake, who just manages to give him some information about the whereabouts of Brigid, which turns out to be a false lead.When he arrives back at his apartment, he finds O'Shaughnessy in a shadowy doorway. Inside, Wilmer, Cairo, and Gutman are there waiting. Gutman hands Spade $10,000 in cash in exchange for the bird. Spade takes the money, but in addition says that they need a ""fall guy"" to take the blame for the murders of at least Thursby and Jacobi, if not Archer as well. Reluctantly, both Cairo and Gutman agree to make Wilmer the fall guy. Gutman proceeds to tell Spade the missing pieces of the story. The night that Thursby was killed, he was first approached by Wilmer and Gutman. The latter attempted to reason with him, but Thursby remained loyal to Brigid O'Shaughnessy and refused to cooperate. Later things escalated, then Wilmer shot Thursby. Also, Brigid O'Shaughnessy had seduced Captain Jacobi and hid the Falcon with him. Later, Brigid O'Shaughnessy instructed Jacobi to deliver the package to Spade. Once Gutman learned of this fact, he attempted to remove Spade from the situation with the spiked drink. Wilmer managed to shoot the captain, but Jacobi still got to Spade's office to deliver the figurine. After finishing his story, Gutman warns Spade to be very careful with Brigid O'Shaughnessy as she is not to be trusted.Spade places a call to his secretary, Effie, and asks her to go the office and pick up the figurine. Effie brings it to Spade's apartment, and Spade hands the package to Gutman, who at this time is overwhelmed with excitement. He checks the figurine, but quickly learns that it is a fake. He realizes with dismay that the Russian must have discovered the true value of the falcon and made a copy. During this time, Wilmer manages to escape from Spade's apartment. Gutman quickly regains composure, and decides to go back to Europe to continue the search. Before he leaves, Gutman asks Spade for the $10,000. Spade returns $9000, saying he's keeping the remainder for his time and expenses. Then Cairo and Gutman leave Spade's apartment.Immediately after Cairo and Gutman leave, Spade phones the police department and tells them the entire story. Wilmer killed Jacobi and Thursby. He also tells them what hotel Gutman is staying at and urges them to hurry, since Gutman and Cairo are leaving town soon. Afterwards, Spade angrily asks Brigid O'Shaughnessy why she killed Miles Archer. At first, Brigid O'Shaughnessy acts horrified at this accusation, but seeing that she cannot lie anymore, she drops the act. She wanted to get Thursby out of the picture so that she could have the Falcon for herself, so she hired Archer to scare him off. When Thursby didn't leave, she killed Archer and attempted to pin the crime on Thursby. When Thursby was later killed himself, she knew that Gutman was in town and that she needed another protector, so she came back to Spade.However, she says that she's also in love with Spade and would have come back to him anyhow. Spade coldly replies that the penalty for murder is most likely twenty years, and he'll wait for her until she gets out. If they hang her, Spade says that he'll always remember her. He goes on to say that while he despised Miles Archer, the man was his partner, and that he's going to turn her in to the police for his murder as that was a line he could not cross in the industry of detective work. Brigid O'Shaughnessy begs him not to, but he replies that he has no choice. When the police get Gutman, Gutman will finger Sam and Brigid as accomplices. Thus the only way Spade can avoid getting charged is to say he played both sides against each other. He tells Brigid O'Shaughnessy that he has some feelings for her, but that he simply can't trust her. Just before the police arrive, Brigid O'Shaughnessy asks Spade if the Falcon had been real, and he'd gotten the entire $10,000, would it have made a difference. Spade replies that, while she shouldn't be so sure that he's crooked, more money would have been one more item on ""her side.""When the police finally show up at Spade's apartment, Spade immediately turns over Brigid O'Shaughnessy as Archer's killer. They tell Spade that the kid Wilmer was waiting for Gutman at the hotel and shot him when he arrived. Spade also hands over the $1000 bill, and the falcon to the police as evidence.","
    
                    Spade and Archer is the name of a San Francisco detective agency. That's for Sam Spade and Miles Archer. The two men are partners, but Sam doesn't like Miles much. A knockout, who goes by the name of Miss Wonderly, walks into their office; and by that night everything's changed. Miles is dead. And so is a man named Floyd Thursby. It seems Miss Wonderly is surrounded by dangerous men. There's Joel Cairo, who uses gardenia-scented calling cards. There's Kasper Gutman, with his enormous girth and feigned civility. Her only hope of protection comes from Sam, who is suspected by the police of one or the other murder. More murders are yet to come, and it will all be because of these dangerous men -- and their lust for a statuette of a bird: the Maltese Falcon.

    Synopsis
    Private eye Sam Spade and his partner Miles Archer are approached by Miss Wonderly to follow a man, Floyd Thursby, who allegedly ran off with her younger sister. The two accept the assignment because the money is good, but Spade also implies that the woman looks like trouble, though she projects wholesome innocence.That night, Detective Tom Polhaus informs Spade that Archer has been shot and killed while tailing Thursby. Even later that night, two officers visit Spade at his apartment and inquire about Spade's whereabouts in the last few hours. Spade asks what the visit is really about. The officers say that Thursby was also killed and that Spade is a suspect, since Thursby likely killed Archer. They have no evidence against Spade at the moment, but tell him that they will be conducting an investigation into the matter.The next day, Spade gets a visit from Archer's wife, with whom he has been having an affair. The widow asks Spade if he killed Miles so that they could be together. Spade dismisses her and tells her to leave, and coldly orders his secretary Effie to remove all of Archer's belongings from the office. He then goes to a new address left in a note from his client, whose name he learns is Brigid O'Shaughnessy. He also finds out that Brigid never had a sister, and Thursby was her acquaintance who had betrayed her.Later, Spade is visited by another man, Joel Cairo, who offers Spade $5000 if the private eye can retrieve a figurine of a black bird that has recently arrived. While Spade has no idea what the man is talking about, he plays along. Suddenly, Cairo pulls a gun on Spade, and declares his intention to search Spade's office. But when he approaches Spade to search his person, Spade disarms him and knocks him unconscious. After cataloguing Cairo's belongings and questioning him in return, Spade returns Cairo's firearm and allows the man to search his office. Following this, Spade is again contacted by Brigid O'Shaughnessy. She offers her sympathies for the death of his partner. Spade senses a connection between O'Shaughnessy and Cairo, and casually mentions that Cairo has contacted him. O'Shaughnessy gets extremely nervous when she hears this. She tells Spade that she must meet with Cairo, and asks Spade to arrange a meeting. Spade agrees.When Cairo and Brigid O'Shaughnessy meet, they make references that the reader and Spade don't initially comprehend. Cairo says he is ready to pay for the black figurine. Brigid O'Shaughnessy, however, says she does not have it at the moment. They also refer to a mysterious figure, ""G"" (""the fat man"" in the film), whom they seem to be scared of. The two then continue to talk about some events that happened overseas. Eventually, O'Shaughnessy insinuates that Cairo is a homosexual, and Cairo insinuates that O'Shaughnessy simply uses her body to get what she wants, and the two begin to fight. At this point, the police show up, coincidentally, to talk to Spade. Spade greets them at the door, but refuses to let them in. The officers say they know Spade was having an affair with Archer's wife; just as they are about to leave, they hear Cairo screaming for help. They force their way into Spade's apartment, and Spade invents a story that involves describing how Cairo and O'Shaughnessy were just play-acting. The officers seem to accept, if not believe, Spade's story, but they take Cairo with them down to the station for some ""grilling"". Spade sends Brigid to stay with Effie, where she will be safe.The next morning, Spade makes his way to the hotel where Cairo is staying. Cairo shows up disheveled, saying that he was held in police custody through the night. Meanwhile, Spade notices that he's being tailed by some kid named Wilmer Cook. He confronts the gunsel[1], and tells him that both he and his boss, ""G,"" will have to deal with him at some point. He later receives a call from Casper Gutman, who wishes to meet with him. Gutman, a huge person weighing over 300 lbs, says he will pay handsomely for the black bird. Spade implies that he can get the item (though at this point this is a bluff), but wants to know what it is first.Gutman tells him that the figurine was a gift from the Island of Malta to the King of Spain a few hundred years ago, but was lost on ship in transit. It was covered with fine jewels, but acquired a layer of black enamel at some time, to conceal its value (estimated to be in the millions). Gutman learned of its whereabouts seventeen years ago, and has been looking for it ever since. He traced it to the home of a Russian General, then sent three of his 'agents' (Cairo, Thursby and Brigid O'Shaughnessy) to get it. The latter supposedly did retrieve the figurine, but learned of its value and decided to keep it for themselves. Spade starts to get dizzy at this point (Gutman has drugged him), and when he goes to leave, Wilmer trips him and knocks him out by kicking his temple.When Spade awakens, he returns to his office and tells the story of the Maltese Falcon to Effie. Soon afterwards, an injured man, identified as Captain Jacobi of ""La Paloma,"" shows up at the office; he drops a package on the floor and then dies of gunshot wounds. Spade opens the package, and finds the figurine falcon. Sam is called away from the office. To prevent losing the item, Spade stores the package at a bus station lost luggage counter and mails himself the collection tag. He first goes to the dock where ""La Paloma"" was anchored, but learns that a fire had been started on board. He then proceeds to the place Rhea Gutman said she was when she phoned earlier. There he finds a drugged-up, seventeen-year old girl, her stomach all scratched up by a pin in attempts to keep herself awake, who just manages to give him some information about the whereabouts of Brigid, which turns out to be a false lead.When he arrives back at his apartment, he finds O'Shaughnessy in a shadowy doorway. Inside, Wilmer, Cairo, and Gutman are there waiting. Gutman hands Spade $10,000 in cash in exchange for the bird. Spade takes the money, but in addition says that they need a ""fall guy"" to take the blame for the murders of at least Thursby and Jacobi, if not Archer as well. Reluctantly, both Cairo and Gutman agree to make Wilmer the fall guy. Gutman proceeds to tell Spade the missing pieces of the story. The night that Thursby was killed, he was first approached by Wilmer and Gutman. The latter attempted to reason with him, but Thursby remained loyal to Brigid O'Shaughnessy and refused to cooperate. Later things escalated, then Wilmer shot Thursby. Also, Brigid O'Shaughnessy had seduced Captain Jacobi and hid the Falcon with him. Later, Brigid O'Shaughnessy instructed Jacobi to deliver the package to Spade. Once Gutman learned of this fact, he attempted to remove Spade from the situation with the spiked drink. Wilmer managed to shoot the captain, but Jacobi still got to Spade's office to deliver the figurine. After finishing his story, Gutman warns Spade to be very careful with Brigid O'Shaughnessy as she is not to be trusted.Spade places a call to his secretary, Effie, and asks her to go the office and pick up the figurine. Effie brings it to Spade's apartment, and Spade hands the package to Gutman, who at this time is overwhelmed with excitement. He checks the figurine, but quickly learns that it is a fake. He realizes with dismay that the Russian must have discovered the true value of the falcon and made a copy. During this time, Wilmer manages to escape from Spade's apartment. Gutman quickly regains composure, and decides to go back to Europe to continue the search. Before he leaves, Gutman asks Spade for the $10,000. Spade returns $9000, saying he's keeping the remainder for his time and expenses. Then Cairo and Gutman leave Spade's apartment.Immediately after Cairo and Gutman leave, Spade phones the police department and tells them the entire story. Wilmer killed Jacobi and Thursby. He also tells them what hotel Gutman is staying at and urges them to hurry, since Gutman and Cairo are leaving town soon. Afterwards, Spade angrily asks Brigid O'Shaughnessy why she killed Miles Archer. At first, Brigid O'Shaughnessy acts horrified at this accusation, but seeing that she cannot lie anymore, she drops the act. She wanted to get Thursby out of the picture so that she could have the Falcon for herself, so she hired Archer to scare him off. When Thursby didn't leave, she killed Archer and attempted to pin the crime on Thursby. When Thursby was later killed himself, she knew that Gutman was in town and that she needed another protector, so she came back to Spade.However, she says that she's also in love with Spade and would have come back to him anyhow. Spade coldly replies that the penalty for murder is most likely twenty years, and he'll wait for her until she gets out. If they hang her, Spade says that he'll always remember her. He goes on to say that while he despised Miles Archer, the man was his partner, and that he's going to turn her in to the police for his murder as that was a line he could not cross in the industry of detective work. Brigid O'Shaughnessy begs him not to, but he replies that he has no choice. When the police get Gutman, Gutman will finger Sam and Brigid as accomplices. Thus the only way Spade can avoid getting charged is to say he played both sides against each other. He tells Brigid O'Shaughnessy that he has some feelings for her, but that he simply can't trust her. Just before the police arrive, Brigid O'Shaughnessy asks Spade if the Falcon had been real, and he'd gotten the entire $10,000, would it have made a difference. Spade replies that, while she shouldn't be so sure that he's crooked, more money would have been one more item on ""her side.""When the police finally show up at Spade's apartment, Spade immediately turns over Brigid O'Shaughnessy as Archer's killer. They tell Spade that the kid Wilmer was waiting for Gutman at the hotel and shot him when he arrived. Spade also hands over the $1000 bill, and the falcon to the police as evidence.

Dumbo is at first scared of Timothy (as he is a mouse), but Timothy's words of wanting to help get Dumbo's Mother released makes him realize the little mouse also means well.

Beaky has money but little business sense, while Johnnie is always thinking about making money without actually working for it. They have a plan to buy some rocky coastline property and develop a seaside resort, but Johnnie changes his mind at the last minute, so he and Beaky must go to London to dissolve their business arrangement.Lina's suspicions get the better of her as she imagines Beaky meeting an untimely death on the dangerous road along the coast. Johnnie has been reading lots of murder mysteries, intrigued with the techniques of poisoning someone without leaving a trace. When the police come calling a day later, she learns that Beaky has indeed died mysteriously, and when Johnnie returns she finds she can no longer trust him. She cannot even stay in the same room at night with him, and when he brings a simple glass of milk to her before bed, Lina is filled with dread. She fears that Johnnie now plots to poison her, and collect the money from her life insurance.Trying to get away while she still can, she tells Johnnie she must visit her Mother. Johnnie is angry with her, but insists on driving her down the same dangerous coastal road, lined with its jagged cliffs.They speed along, Johnnie drives faster and faster, skirting the edge of the cliff, and veering at the last second down a ""shortcut"". Lina can only ride along in terror of what Johnnie has planned.As he swerves around a curve, Lina's door falls open and she nearly tumbles out over the edge of the cliff. Screaming, she clings to the car, as Johnnie's hand reaches over. Siezed with terror, she tries to avoid being pushed out, but he lunges at her, and at the last instant pulls her back into the car.Skidding to a stop, he demands to know what's gotten into her. ""How much can a man stand?"" he asks. Gradually, understanding comes over her, and as Johnnie explains, she realizes that he had nothing to do with Beaky's death, and that his fascination with poison is centered on himself. He meant to commit suicide rather than face his insurmountable debts, and spare his beloved Lina the shame of seeing him in prison. Clinging to him, she vows that they will face the future together, and they turn the car around for home.

                    Adult Huw Morgan is about to move away from the south Wales coal mining village he has lived in his entire life. He remembers back to his growing up period, when the dust from the coal mines, which were then new to the area, had not yet darkened the lush green valley. His father and his five adult brothers worked in the mines, which ended up being a source of conflict, not only between management and laborers, but also within the Morgan family, its individual members who had different views of their role in the mine. Despite his tender age, Huw immediately fell in love with Bronwyn, who came to the village to marry his eldest brother Ivor. Also on the love front, his only sister Angharad fell in love with the new preacher, Mr. Gruffydd, who had a slightly different view of his relationship with her, and which would end up destroying his life in the valley. Huw would be the only of his siblings to obtain an education, but he learned as much about life as he did about book learning in his schooling. His first work experience post school, which surprised his family, would result in the loss of his youthful innocence.

Sullivan wants to make a ""message"" movie, specifically about the plight of the downtrodden in society. Beyond wanting him to continue making money-making escapist movies, the studio executives counter that his privileged background does not make him qualified to make a movie about the downtrodden. So Sullivan decides to hit the road with only 10¢ in his pocket to experience truly what it's like to be poor. The studio executives will only allow him to do so if they can follow him and document his experience. Not wanting it to be a publicity stunt, Sullivan makes a deal with his tailing party: leave him alone for a few weeks, with them all to meet up at a determined location after that time. After a few mis-starts where he can't seem to shed his privileged past, Sullivan does manage to hit the road, this time with an aspiring but struggling actress who believes she can better help him navigate road life. He met her when she did a Good Samaritan deed for him. But when Sullivan tries to do his own Good Samaritan deed in return, he finds that shedding his downtrodden life may be even harder than it was to shed his privileged life if he is able to do it at all.

"11","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034167/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","It's 1916 near Pall Mall, at Three Forks of the Wolf, in Tennessee. At the local church, Pastor Rosier Pile (Walter Brennan) is delivering his sermon. There's a disturbance outside. Alvin C. York (Gary Cooper), Ike Botkin (Ward Bond), and Buck Lipscomb (Noah Beery Jr.) are riding their horses, whooping and hollering, and shooting. They were drunk. York shoots his initials into a nearby tree.Next day, there's a sign on a building that says, ""Rosier Pile, General Merchandise."" It's Pastor Pile's business. Inside, a traveling salesman is attempting to interest Pile in buying some hats and bloomers. The pastor says the women around there would not be interested.One man at the store has a copy of the Tennessean Dispatch newspaper, but the men aren't interested in the headline, which is about the Germans on the attack in Europe.The men at the store recall many times past when Alvin York and his drinking got him in trouble. Mrs. York comes into the store and they all fall quiet. She seems to have mixed feelings about her son. She tells Pile how Alvin works very hard, for very little reward, and she doesn't blame him for cutting loose now and then, however she considers that perhaps some old fashioned religion might do him some good. Pastor Pile promises to go have a talk with him.Mrs. York sends Alvin's younger brother, George (Dickie Moore), to go find Alvin, who reportedly traveled up near the Kentucky border with his buddies. George finds Alvin at a bar that sits exactly on the boundary line between Kentucky and Tennessee. Selling booze is only legal in Kentucky, so the bartended has to be sure and sell it only on that side of the room. George goes into the bar, rifle at the ready, and tells Alvin their mother wants him. Alvin always does as his mother says, so he gets up to go. A man laughs at him, teasing him for running off to his mother. A fight ensues and continues until George reminds Alvin that their mother is waiting.On an ensuing day, the pastor rides his horse, Fred, to see Alvin, who's plowing furrows on a rocky ridge. The pastor tries to convince Alvin to try and shake loose of Satan before he gets done in. Alvin doesn't disagree with the advice, but he doesn't know exactly how to go about doing that. The past makes an analogy with a nearby large oak tree, noting that there are strong invisible roots that anchor the tree to the earth. Alvin's not opposed to religion, he just thinks it has to come to him and not be pursued.Another day, Alvin, George and three of their hounds are chasing a fox. They run through the yard of a nearby farm and Alvin gets distracted by Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie), out sitting on her porch. He stops to say hello. He knew Gracie, but hadn't seen her for a long time and she'd grown up considerably.At home that night, when Alvin asks his mother some questions about ""settin' up"" in life (i.e., getting married), she asks who the girl is. He tells her it's Gracie Williams. Mother just shakes her head, perhaps thinking that Alvin isn't ready for marriage.Zeb Andrews (Robert Porterfield) is over to see Gracie and ask her to the shindig Saturday night. They are out on the front porch when Alvin comes walking up. When Zeb realizes that Alvin has come by to court Gracie, he starts making subtly snide remarks about Alvin. When Gracie goes to get them something to drink, Alvin grabs Zeb and jerks him off the porch. When Gracie returns, she sees walking away off in the distance and she's upset at Alvin for being the cause.Alvin tells Gracie he wants to marry her. Attracted to him, but upset at his behavior, she tells him she wouldn't have him on a Christmas tree. Alvin incorrectly determines she said that because Zeb has a piece of prime farming bottomland. He tells Gracie that he could get some bottomland too, and he determines to go make that happen.York stops by some bottomland and scoops up a handful, taking it home to show his mother. She tells Alvin that the bottomland folks have always looked down on them, and always would. She told him that her father had worked long and hard to get him some bottomland, but he finally had to give it up. York is determined that he won't be stopped.Alvin to see a man named Thompkins, who has a piece of bottomland for sale. He takes everything he can spare to barter with, including some fox pelts, chickens, his mule, a broken clock, and some goose feathers. Thompkins offers him $50 for all of it, even though it's probably worth another $15-$20. Thompkins wants $120 for the bottomland that he has for sale. Alvin says ok, and Thompkins gives him 60 days to come up with the $70 balance.York sets about taking on physically demanding jobs for others, including removing big rocks from a man's land for 75 cents/day. George helps him splits rails and pull stumps, using their horse. York sells a fox pelt to the pastor. Miss Gracie goes out to see York one day while he's plowing a field. She wants to say something to her, but can't find the words, so he grabs and kisses her. She tells him that's what she wanted, and she runs off.York has accumulated only $44.35 as the 60 day deadline approaches. As he lays down to sleep, exhausted, his mother pulls a blanket over him and prays to the Lord to help him.Alvin goes to see Mr. Thompkins, asking for an extra four days. He knows that there is a beef and turkey target shoot coming up and if he can win those shoots and sell the turkey and the beef, he'll have the money. Thompkins claims that another man wants the land, but he decides to give Alvin the extra four days.The day of the shoot, Alvin gets a turkey, when others failed, by tricking the bird with a gobble-gobble imitation, resulting in the turkey popping it's head up from behind a log, then Alvin shoots it. He trades the turkey to the contest organizer for an additional shot at the beef prize.For the beef shoot, each contestant must buy a shot. Alvin buys four more, in addition to the one he traded the turkey for. He wants to win the top five prizes, which would comprise the entire steer. Surprised, none of the other contestants believe Alvin has a chance. ""Ain't nobody ever cut five centers, lessen he was Daniel Boone, an' you ain't wearin' no coon-skin cap!"" one of the other men tells him. The target is a white-colored V shape cutout. The shooters aim at the center notch of the V. Alvin cuts his first four centers. The last man with a chance to win the last fifth of the steer, Tom, cuts center with his last shot. Alvin then wets his front site, aims and fires. He cuts center also. Pastor Pile is the judge, and declares the shots were no more than a hair apart, ""but Alvin done cut center fair and square!"" and Alvin was declared the winner.Alvin then puts the cow up for a drawing, selling chances as a way to make the money he needs. He collects what he needs and approaches Mr. Thompkins, who was just then arriving with Zeb Andrews.Thompkins tells Alvin that he decided to sell the bottomland to Zeb. ""Your time was rightly up,"" Alvin is told, ""and besides, I never thought you had a chance to win that contest anyhow."" Alvin is aghast, ready to punch Thompkins and/or Zeb. They both turn around and put some distance between themselves and Alvin, as Alvin's friends and the pastor hold him back.Alvin can't believe Thompkins went back on his word. He dwells on it into the night, and as he drinks with his buddies, he decides things must be set right, so he takes off to go get what's rightfully his. He heads for the Thompkins place, riding in a thunderstorm, with lightning flashing very close by. There's a flash and he wakes up to find his mule on the ground, but alive, and his rifle barrel split. He's not hurt, but when he realizes they'd been struck by lightning, he takes that as the sign from above he thought would come if he was meant to have religion. York rides over to the church and walks inside as services are underway. The pastor sees him and calls for the congregation to sing, ""Give Me That Old Time Religion."" York makes his way forward, taking a knee and shaking hands with the pastor.Sometime later, Alvin goes to see Thompkins, who thinks Alvin means him harm and grabs a wrench to protect himself. Alvin tells him he just wants to buy his mule, Abraham, back. He also asks forgiveness for getting upset with Thompkins earlier. Thompkins decides to offer Abraham to York for just $20, and he throws in the clock, which doesn't work anyway.York next goes to see Zeb, who hides, but York is there just to ask him about a possible job working that bottomland Zeb bought from Thompkins. Thompkins admits that he bought the land just to spite York, and offers to let him till the land on a share-crop basis, and maybe within a few years, York could afford to buy it. York is pretty well convinced now that living in accord with the words of the Bible is well substantiated.Finally, Alvin goes to see Gracie and apologize for coming between her and Zeb, the way that he did. Of course, that's not what she wanted to hear and she gets mad at him for that too, telling him she wants him, not Zeb, not any bottomland and not a beef cow. She runs off crying, leaving Alvin totally mystified.A man named Luke comes riding into town to announce that President Wilson had declared war against Germany. All able bodied men were required to register with the draft. Some men didn't want to wait to be drafted and intended to enlist right away, but when some asked Alvin what he was going to do, he said ""wait."" In fact, the pastor knew that Alvin hadn't even registered, and he confronts him in private about it. York tells the pastor that he's not going to register, that ""War is killin', an' killin' is agin' the Book."" The pastor tells York that he needs to register or get in trouble. He advises Alvin that he could then request exemption from fighting, on the basis of religion. The pastor offers to write the letter to the draft board. The pastor's letter to the draft board on behalf of York is rejected. The board determined that the pastor's little church was not one of those broadly recognized throughout the country. The pastor sets about preparing an appeal.Meanwhile, Alvin shows Gracie where he plans to build their house on the bottomland, most likely within 2-3 years.York's final appeal was denied by Washington, D.C. He is ordered to report to Nashville that next night. He tells the pastor he won't go, that he'll hide in the hills and fight them if they come after him. Alvin is told by Pastor Pile that ""The war is clear across the ocean, and a lot can happen before you get there. Trust in the Lord Alvin."" When Alvin realizes how his attitude and talk was not in accordance with what the Bible says, he decides he'll go.It's a tough goodbye for York, as he faces his mother, brother and sister Rosie (June Lockhart). Alvin gives George his rifle. Gracie comes by the house and hugs him, cries, then quickly kisses him before rushing off. He tells her and his family, ""I'll be a comin' back!""York reports to Camp Gordon, Georgia. The officers and non-coms are advised that York is a conscientious objector, so he should be watched closely. It's apparent that such men are not held in high regard by the non-comms, suspicious that it's just an excuse used by cowards.Alvin asks one of the other soldiers, a man from New York named Pusher Ross (George Tobias) about a subway, which he'd never heard of.York is assigned rifle #218102. The Sgt. sarcastically cautions him not to kill anyone with it before he gets to France. The first day on the firing line, York hits low and right on the center ring, then figures out that the rifle sights aren't quite right, and puts the next five in the bull's eye. When an officer asked him where he learned to shoot, he said he just always seemed to know how.Alvin is ordered to report to a Major Buxton (Stanley Ridges). There is also a Captain Danforth (Harvey Stephens) in the room. York is told that Captain Danforth is prepared to recommend him for promotion to corporal and assignment as a shooting instructor. York tells them that he is against the promotion, and against killing, or facilitating the killing of other men. Danforth engages York in a debate about Biblical verses and their meanings. York proves to be well versed, and his beliefs are confirmed.The major hands York a copy of the History of the U.S. and tells him the book is full of stories about great men. He tells York about the concept of freedom, including it's importance to men like Daniel Boone, who was a very well known figure to York. The major goes on to explain that the preservation of freedom sometimes requires the full measure of devotion, which is a man's life. Major Buxton allows York to take a 10 day leave of absence, to go home and think about his feelings and beliefs. He asks to take the history book with him and the major tells him to go ahead.Back in Tennessee, Alvin takes one of his hunting dogs, the U.S. history book, and the Bible, and sits on a rock ledge, reading and thinking in solitude about his options. He is confused about whether country or God comes first in a man's life. When he reads the words attributed to Jesus: ""Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's,"" that helps him decide. He returns to Georgia and tells Major Buxton he had decided to stay in the Army, even though there were many things he hadn't fully figured out yet. York is promoted and once he and his All-American Division completes their training, they sail for France. York writes home and tells his family and Gracie that they will soon be moving up to the front lines.Once they move to the front, they are hunkered down in a trench, discussing things with a couple of Brits. The Brits are teaching the Americans how to interpret the sound of incoming artillery as to whether they need to duck or not, when an American named Bert Thomas (David Bruce) takes a piece of shrapnel through his helmet and dies.York and his division were part of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Argonne Forest, a part of the final Allied offensive of World War I that stretched along the entire Western Front. On 8 October, 1918, orders were given to exit the trenches and attack the Germans at 0610. The Americans do as ordered, experiencing heavy fire and casualties. The first action for York was to enter a German trench as part of an ambush of some approaching Germans. As the sides engage, some of the Germans turn around to go back and warn their troops to the rear. York pulls a grenade and lobs it in front of the Germans, halting their escape.York and few men from his division take some prisoners. As they proceed to try and find their way back to the American's line, they are ambushed by a German machine gun. The senior non-comms are injured too badly to continue, so Sergeant Bernard Early orders York to take over. York immediately takes off around a side hill and takes out two machine guns that had the men pinned down. He proves just as good with a handgun as with his rifle. His fire is so deadly and efficient, that dozens of Germans surrender, not realizing it's just one man attacking them.One German decides to pull the pin on a grenade he had and he throws it, killing Pusher. York goes to find the man who threw it and when the man runs, York shoots him. He tells the German officer to order his men to drop their utility belts and not to try anything like that again. There's only seven U.S. soldiers with York, controlling maybe 50-75 Germans.They march on through the trench with their prisoners, coming upon some more fighting. York tells the German officer to order the men who are shooting to surrender. The officer orders his bugler to sound retreat, adding to the Americans prisoner total. York tries twice to turn the prisoners over to the first Americans they come across, but they don't know what to do with them, so he continues on to a town were there are already other prisoners imprisoned. The officer in charge is shocked to see that just eight men had captured 132 Germans, and he helps find somewhere to put them. Rumors start flying around the American infantry forces, and before too long, the stories have been exaggerated to the point that York supposedly single-handedly captured the German Kaiser, plus half the German Army.Later, at the site of the battle, York was describing his actions and when he was asked by a general how many men he'd killed, he said he didn't know. Danforth was there and said they had counted 20 German bodies.York explains to the then ""Colonel"" Buxton that he was still set against killing other men, but when he saw the German machine guns killing so many Americans, he had to do it to save lives.Sergeant York was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Medal of Honor, the French Croix de Guerre, the French Legion of Honor, the Italian Croce di Guerra al Merito, and the Montenegro French War Medal.Tennessee Congressman, Cordell Hull (Charles Trowbridge), was on the dock to meet York as he disembarks from his ship back in the U.S. There's a ticker tape parade. The mayor of NY hands him the key to the city. He asks only for a ride on the Bronx Express Subway.Officials take him to a fancy suite and there's a framed photo of his mother on the piano, which he finds very touching. He gets a phone call. It's Mother York on the other end, but they have trouble hearing each other. He speaks with Gracie too.York is recognized by Congress and the stock exchange suspends it's operations in his honor, but Alvin just wants to go home. Mr. Hull tells him there is a quarter of a million dollars in offers to do movies, theater and sponsorships. Alvin tells him he's not proud of what he did in France and doesn't want to profit from it. He chooses to go home.In Crossville, TN, there's a large crowd at the train depot. York is told he's the biggest hero in those parts since Danl' Boone and Andy Jackson.Alvin and Gracie go to check out their bottomland. Alvin is surprised to see that a new bridge had been built across the creek. They spoke about plans for the governor to marry them, but York is concerned that he doesn't have anything to offer Gracie yet, so he wants her to wait another 2-3 years. She tells him there's no need, then asks him to close his eyes as she leads him up the path. When he opens his eyes, he sees that the people of the State of Tenn. had built him a house, barn, and water pump, all located on 200 acres of prime bottomland. He seems amazed and happy as he and Gracie move forward hand-in-hand to check it out.","

    Synopsis
    It's 1916 near Pall Mall, at Three Forks of the Wolf, in Tennessee. At the local church, Pastor Rosier Pile (Walter Brennan) is delivering his sermon. There's a disturbance outside. Alvin C. York (Gary Cooper), Ike Botkin (Ward Bond), and Buck Lipscomb (Noah Beery Jr.) are riding their horses, whooping and hollering, and shooting. They were drunk. York shoots his initials into a nearby tree.Next day, there's a sign on a building that says, ""Rosier Pile, General Merchandise."" It's Pastor Pile's business. Inside, a traveling salesman is attempting to interest Pile in buying some hats and bloomers. The pastor says the women around there would not be interested.One man at the store has a copy of the Tennessean Dispatch newspaper, but the men aren't interested in the headline, which is about the Germans on the attack in Europe.The men at the store recall many times past when Alvin York and his drinking got him in trouble. Mrs. York comes into the store and they all fall quiet. She seems to have mixed feelings about her son. She tells Pile how Alvin works very hard, for very little reward, and she doesn't blame him for cutting loose now and then, however she considers that perhaps some old fashioned religion might do him some good. Pastor Pile promises to go have a talk with him.Mrs. York sends Alvin's younger brother, George (Dickie Moore), to go find Alvin, who reportedly traveled up near the Kentucky border with his buddies. George finds Alvin at a bar that sits exactly on the boundary line between Kentucky and Tennessee. Selling booze is only legal in Kentucky, so the bartended has to be sure and sell it only on that side of the room. George goes into the bar, rifle at the ready, and tells Alvin their mother wants him. Alvin always does as his mother says, so he gets up to go. A man laughs at him, teasing him for running off to his mother. A fight ensues and continues until George reminds Alvin that their mother is waiting.On an ensuing day, the pastor rides his horse, Fred, to see Alvin, who's plowing furrows on a rocky ridge. The pastor tries to convince Alvin to try and shake loose of Satan before he gets done in. Alvin doesn't disagree with the advice, but he doesn't know exactly how to go about doing that. The past makes an analogy with a nearby large oak tree, noting that there are strong invisible roots that anchor the tree to the earth. Alvin's not opposed to religion, he just thinks it has to come to him and not be pursued.Another day, Alvin, George and three of their hounds are chasing a fox. They run through the yard of a nearby farm and Alvin gets distracted by Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie), out sitting on her porch. He stops to say hello. He knew Gracie, but hadn't seen her for a long time and she'd grown up considerably.At home that night, when Alvin asks his mother some questions about ""settin' up"" in life (i.e., getting married), she asks who the girl is. He tells her it's Gracie Williams. Mother just shakes her head, perhaps thinking that Alvin isn't ready for marriage.Zeb Andrews (Robert Porterfield) is over to see Gracie and ask her to the shindig Saturday night. They are out on the front porch when Alvin comes walking up. When Zeb realizes that Alvin has come by to court Gracie, he starts making subtly snide remarks about Alvin. When Gracie goes to get them something to drink, Alvin grabs Zeb and jerks him off the porch. When Gracie returns, she sees walking away off in the distance and she's upset at Alvin for being the cause.Alvin tells Gracie he wants to marry her. Attracted to him, but upset at his behavior, she tells him she wouldn't have him on a Christmas tree. Alvin incorrectly determines she said that because Zeb has a piece of prime farming bottomland. He tells Gracie that he could get some bottomland too, and he determines to go make that happen.York stops by some bottomland and scoops up a handful, taking it home to show his mother. She tells Alvin that the bottomland folks have always looked down on them, and always would. She told him that her father had worked long and hard to get him some bottomland, but he finally had to give it up. York is determined that he won't be stopped.Alvin to see a man named Thompkins, who has a piece of bottomland for sale. He takes everything he can spare to barter with, including some fox pelts, chickens, his mule, a broken clock, and some goose feathers. Thompkins offers him $50 for all of it, even though it's probably worth another $15-$20. Thompkins wants $120 for the bottomland that he has for sale. Alvin says ok, and Thompkins gives him 60 days to come up with the $70 balance.York sets about taking on physically demanding jobs for others, including removing big rocks from a man's land for 75 cents/day. George helps him splits rails and pull stumps, using their horse. York sells a fox pelt to the pastor. Miss Gracie goes out to see York one day while he's plowing a field. She wants to say something to her, but can't find the words, so he grabs and kisses her. She tells him that's what she wanted, and she runs off.York has accumulated only $44.35 as the 60 day deadline approaches. As he lays down to sleep, exhausted, his mother pulls a blanket over him and prays to the Lord to help him.Alvin goes to see Mr. Thompkins, asking for an extra four days. He knows that there is a beef and turkey target shoot coming up and if he can win those shoots and sell the turkey and the beef, he'll have the money. Thompkins claims that another man wants the land, but he decides to give Alvin the extra four days.The day of the shoot, Alvin gets a turkey, when others failed, by tricking the bird with a gobble-gobble imitation, resulting in the turkey popping it's head up from behind a log, then Alvin shoots it. He trades the turkey to the contest organizer for an additional shot at the beef prize.For the beef shoot, each contestant must buy a shot. Alvin buys four more, in addition to the one he traded the turkey for. He wants to win the top five prizes, which would comprise the entire steer. Surprised, none of the other contestants believe Alvin has a chance. ""Ain't nobody ever cut five centers, lessen he was Daniel Boone, an' you ain't wearin' no coon-skin cap!"" one of the other men tells him. The target is a white-colored V shape cutout. The shooters aim at the center notch of the V. Alvin cuts his first four centers. The last man with a chance to win the last fifth of the steer, Tom, cuts center with his last shot. Alvin then wets his front site, aims and fires. He cuts center also. Pastor Pile is the judge, and declares the shots were no more than a hair apart, ""but Alvin done cut center fair and square!"" and Alvin was declared the winner.Alvin then puts the cow up for a drawing, selling chances as a way to make the money he needs. He collects what he needs and approaches Mr. Thompkins, who was just then arriving with Zeb Andrews.Thompkins tells Alvin that he decided to sell the bottomland to Zeb. ""Your time was rightly up,"" Alvin is told, ""and besides, I never thought you had a chance to win that contest anyhow."" Alvin is aghast, ready to punch Thompkins and/or Zeb. They both turn around and put some distance between themselves and Alvin, as Alvin's friends and the pastor hold him back.Alvin can't believe Thompkins went back on his word. He dwells on it into the night, and as he drinks with his buddies, he decides things must be set right, so he takes off to go get what's rightfully his. He heads for the Thompkins place, riding in a thunderstorm, with lightning flashing very close by. There's a flash and he wakes up to find his mule on the ground, but alive, and his rifle barrel split. He's not hurt, but when he realizes they'd been struck by lightning, he takes that as the sign from above he thought would come if he was meant to have religion. York rides over to the church and walks inside as services are underway. The pastor sees him and calls for the congregation to sing, ""Give Me That Old Time Religion."" York makes his way forward, taking a knee and shaking hands with the pastor.Sometime later, Alvin goes to see Thompkins, who thinks Alvin means him harm and grabs a wrench to protect himself. Alvin tells him he just wants to buy his mule, Abraham, back. He also asks forgiveness for getting upset with Thompkins earlier. Thompkins decides to offer Abraham to York for just $20, and he throws in the clock, which doesn't work anyway.York next goes to see Zeb, who hides, but York is there just to ask him about a possible job working that bottomland Zeb bought from Thompkins. Thompkins admits that he bought the land just to spite York, and offers to let him till the land on a share-crop basis, and maybe within a few years, York could afford to buy it. York is pretty well convinced now that living in accord with the words of the Bible is well substantiated.Finally, Alvin goes to see Gracie and apologize for coming between her and Zeb, the way that he did. Of course, that's not what she wanted to hear and she gets mad at him for that too, telling him she wants him, not Zeb, not any bottomland and not a beef cow. She runs off crying, leaving Alvin totally mystified.A man named Luke comes riding into town to announce that President Wilson had declared war against Germany. All able bodied men were required to register with the draft. Some men didn't want to wait to be drafted and intended to enlist right away, but when some asked Alvin what he was going to do, he said ""wait."" In fact, the pastor knew that Alvin hadn't even registered, and he confronts him in private about it. York tells the pastor that he's not going to register, that ""War is killin', an' killin' is agin' the Book."" The pastor tells York that he needs to register or get in trouble. He advises Alvin that he could then request exemption from fighting, on the basis of religion. The pastor offers to write the letter to the draft board. The pastor's letter to the draft board on behalf of York is rejected. The board determined that the pastor's little church was not one of those broadly recognized throughout the country. The pastor sets about preparing an appeal.Meanwhile, Alvin shows Gracie where he plans to build their house on the bottomland, most likely within 2-3 years.York's final appeal was denied by Washington, D.C. He is ordered to report to Nashville that next night. He tells the pastor he won't go, that he'll hide in the hills and fight them if they come after him. Alvin is told by Pastor Pile that ""The war is clear across the ocean, and a lot can happen before you get there. Trust in the Lord Alvin."" When Alvin realizes how his attitude and talk was not in accordance with what the Bible says, he decides he'll go.It's a tough goodbye for York, as he faces his mother, brother and sister Rosie (June Lockhart). Alvin gives George his rifle. Gracie comes by the house and hugs him, cries, then quickly kisses him before rushing off. He tells her and his family, ""I'll be a comin' back!""York reports to Camp Gordon, Georgia. The officers and non-coms are advised that York is a conscientious objector, so he should be watched closely. It's apparent that such men are not held in high regard by the non-comms, suspicious that it's just an excuse used by cowards.Alvin asks one of the other soldiers, a man from New York named Pusher Ross (George Tobias) about a subway, which he'd never heard of.York is assigned rifle #218102. The Sgt. sarcastically cautions him not to kill anyone with it before he gets to France. The first day on the firing line, York hits low and right on the center ring, then figures out that the rifle sights aren't quite right, and puts the next five in the bull's eye. When an officer asked him where he learned to shoot, he said he just always seemed to know how.Alvin is ordered to report to a Major Buxton (Stanley Ridges). There is also a Captain Danforth (Harvey Stephens) in the room. York is told that Captain Danforth is prepared to recommend him for promotion to corporal and assignment as a shooting instructor. York tells them that he is against the promotion, and against killing, or facilitating the killing of other men. Danforth engages York in a debate about Biblical verses and their meanings. York proves to be well versed, and his beliefs are confirmed.
The major hands York a copy of the History of the U.S. and tells him the book is full of stories about great men. He tells York about the concept of freedom, including it's importance to men like Daniel Boone, who was a very well known figure to York. The major goes on to explain that the preservation of freedom sometimes requires the full measure of devotion, which is a man's life. Major Buxton allows York to take a 10 day leave of absence, to go home and think about his feelings and beliefs. He asks to take the history book with him and the major tells him to go ahead.Back in Tennessee, Alvin takes one of his hunting dogs, the U.S. history book, and the Bible, and sits on a rock ledge, reading and thinking in solitude about his options. He is confused about whether country or God comes first in a man's life. When he reads the words attributed to Jesus: ""Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's,"" that helps him decide. He returns to Georgia and tells Major Buxton he had decided to stay in the Army, even though there were many things he hadn't fully figured out yet. York is promoted and once he and his All-American Division completes their training, they sail for France. York writes home and tells his family and Gracie that they will soon be moving up to the front lines.Once they move to the front, they are hunkered down in a trench, discussing things with a couple of Brits. The Brits are teaching the Americans how to interpret the sound of incoming artillery as to whether they need to duck or not, when an American named Bert Thomas (David Bruce) takes a piece of shrapnel through his helmet and dies.York and his division were part of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Argonne Forest, a part of the final Allied offensive of World War I that stretched along the entire Western Front.

Her friend Marcia is shocked when she accidentally sees welts on Ivy's back, and when Hyde suddenly comes to the flat, he behaves particularly cruelly toward Ivy.

When she shows him her scars and he realizes what Hyde has done to her, Henry is ashamed and soothingly promises her that she will never see Hyde again.That night, as Henry happily strolls across the park toward Bea's house, he suddenly turns into Hyde, without having taken the serum. He then goes to Ivy's flat and finds her celebrating her freedom from him. He repeats words that she had spoken to Henry, she becomes hysterical with fright and screams, but he strangles her to death before the neighbors can summon the police. He then rushes to the outher door of the laboratory but realizes that the key was destroyed. Poole will not admit him through the front door, so, in desperation Hyde goes to Dr. John Lanyon, Henry's good friend.

Hyde later secretly asks the proprietor to fire Ivy and, despite her reluctance, insists on taking her home in a carriage, where he forces himself on her.Some time later, Bea is concerned that Henry has not written to her in weeks, but hides her worries from her father, who decides that she and Henry may marry, after all.Meanwhile, Ivy, who has been set up in a flat by Hyde, lives in constant fear of him. Her friend Marcia is shocked when she accidentally sees welts on Ivy's back, and when Hyde suddenly comes to the flat, he behaves particularly cruelly toward Ivy. Soon Henry learns that Bea has just returned and determines never to take the serum again. He then sends an anonymous gift of fifty pounds to Ivy and melts down the key to the street entrance of his laboratory, which ""Hyde"" has been using. That afternoon, Henry meets Bea at a museum and is overjoyed that Sir Charles now agrees to their imminent marriage. When Henry returns home, Ivy is waiting in his patient's room because Marcia and her boyfriend had recommended him. Ivy recognizes Henry as the man who was once kind to her, but momentarily has an uneasy feeling about him. When she shows him her scars and he realizes what Hyde has done to her, Henry is ashamed and soothingly promises her that she will never see Hyde again.That night, as Henry happily strolls across the park toward Bea's house, he suddenly turns into Hyde, without having taken the serum. He then goes to Ivy's flat and finds her celebrating her freedom from him. He repeats words that she had spoken to Henry, she becomes hysterical with fright and screams, but he strangles her to death before the neighbors can summon the police. He then rushes to the outher door of the laboratory but realizes that the key was destroyed. Poole will not admit him through the front door, so, in desperation Hyde goes to Dr. John Lanyon, Henry's good friend. After demanding the medications that work as an antidote, Hyde transforms back into Henry, to John's shock and horror. Henry reveals everything to John, then goes to Bea to break their engagement. She refueses to accept that they cannot be married, and he leaves, then returns as Hyde. She faints, but her initial scream has roused Sir Charles, whom Hyde then beats to death with his walking stick. Now desperate, Hyde pushes past Poole at Henry's front door and goes to the laboratory to take more antidote. As Sir Charles's body is examined by the police, John sees Henry's cane and realizes what must have happened. He then takes the police to Henry's house where they break down the door of the laboratory just after Hyde has taken the antidote and turned back into Henry. Henry says that Hyde was there but left, but in his anxiety under John accusations that he, indeed, is Sir Charles's murderer, Henry quickly transforms back into Hyde. While attempting to fight off the police and flee, he is mortally wounded, and as he dies, his demeanor changes back into Henry.

    Synopsis
    See Bogie at his best as world weary ""Mad Dog Roy Earle"" Given a pardon from jail he gets back into the swing of things as he robs a swanky resort. Which results in a botched caper. Bogie takes it on the lam with the always underated Ida Lupino and meets his destiny from a snipers bullet in the mountain tops. Arthur Kennedy in a good early role. Bogart had suffered many years at the hands of Warner brothers short sightedness. In this movie he got a chance to sink his teeth into it. Filled with classic noir elements as the doomed criminal who would rather be a farmer but must pull one last job. It's all there, the loping gait, thumbs shoved into his belt loops. Here is a man who must remain true to his inner convictions no matter how many coppers try to chase him down.

                    New York sophisticates David Smith and Ann Smith née Krausheimer have been lovingly and passionately married for three years, or so they believed. They are told individually that due to a technicality - an unresolved municipal and state jurisdictional issue at the time of their supposed marriage - their wedding was not legal, and as such they are not really married. Despite David saying earlier in the day that if he had to do his life all over again that he would not have married her (even though he loves her), it is Ann that decides not to marry David this second time around due to an action, or in reality inaction, by David in reaction to the news of their marriage being invalid. While Ann goes about her life as a supposedly single woman (which includes calling herself Ann Krausheimer), David does whatever he can to win Ann back. But winning Ann's hand may be difficult as part of Ann's new life is dating other men. One of those other men and the most serious is David's best friend and business partner, Jefferson Custer. Ann and Jeff's relationship quickly gets to the point where Jeff introduces her to his visiting parents, with whom Ann and Jeff are going on a skiing vacation to Lake Placid. David hopes to exploit that vacation in order to win Ann back.

Captain Bernsdorff sends men ashore to capture a trading post - just before U-37 is destroyed by an RCAF bomber. Lieutenant Ernst Hirth, eager but inexperienced leader of the shore party, (comprising his resentful deputy Lieutenant Kuhnecke and the sailors Vogel, Kranz, Lohrmann and Jahner), follows his orders regardless. In the trading post, the Factor is updating French-Canadian trapper Johnnie Barras (just back from eleven months in the wild) on the outbreak of war when Hirth and his men burst in, injuring the Eskimo servant, Nick. After an edgy night, a radio ham from Grand Rapids, Michigan, calls up for his regular chess game with the Factor and Johnnie shouts an alarm into the microphone. Jahner shoots him, and he later dies. Knowing that a seaplane will come to the post to investigate, the Nazis plan to hijack it and fly to the neutral U.S.A. They take the plane (with much loss of life), but Jahner is shot by an Eskimo marksman as it takes off. Kuhnecke misjudges the plane's fuel reserves and dies when it crashes into a lake, still well north of the 49th parallel. The four survivors come upon a Hutterite community of émigré Germans, led by Peter. The gentle Vogel befriends the fifteen-year-old Anna and, impressed by the community's spirit, volunteers to bake its bread. Hirth takes the Hutterites for secret Nazi sympathisers and openly appeals for their help at a general meeting, where Peter angrily refuses him. While Hirth, Kranz and Lohrmann prepare to move on, Peter persuades Vogel to stay on as the baker. But Hirth returns and summarily executes him for desertion. The three Nazis reach Winnipeg, and learn that the Mounties are on their trail. They set off for Vancouver, intending to take a Japanese boat to Russia. Mounties suspect their presence at the Indian Day celebrations in Banff, and Kranz is arrested when he panics and reveals his identity. Hirth and Lohrmann proceed on foot across the Rockies and stumble into the camp of Philip Armstrong Scott, an English aesthete and academic researching the history and culture of the Blackfoot Sioux. They respond to his hospitality by burning his paintings, books and research notes and tying him up, but he breaks free and captures Lohrmann. The wounded Hirth hops the freight car of a train heading for the U.S. border and overpowers fellow stowaway Andy Brock, an AWOL Canadian soldier. The train halts at Niagara Falls and Hirth identifies himself to the U.S. customs officers, demanding to be taken to the German embassy. But Brock persuades them to classify himself and Hirth as ""improperly manifested freight"" and to return his carriage to Canada. Now disarmed, Hirth is no match for Brock's fists...","
    
                    In the early years of World War II, a German U-boat (U-37) sinks Allied shipping in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and then tries to evade Canadian Military Forces seeking to destroy it by sailing up to Hudson Bay. The U-boat's Fanatical Nazi captain sends some members of his crew to look for food and other supplies at a Hudson Bay Company outpost. No sooner than the shore party (lead by Lieutenant Hirth) reaches the shore, the U-boat is spotted and sunk by the Canadian Armed Forces leaving the six members of the shore party stranded in Canada. The Nazi Lieutenant then starts to plan his crews' return to the Fatherland. He needs to reach the neutral United States or be captured. Along the way they meet a variety of characters each with their own views on the war and nationalism. In this film Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger show their ideas of why the United States should join the Allied fight against the Nazis.

    Synopsis
    U-37, the first German submarine to reach Canada, sinks a merchant ship in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, then runs for cover in Hudson Bay. Captain Bernsdorff sends men ashore to capture a trading post - just before U-37 is destroyed by an RCAF bomber. Lieutenant Ernst Hirth, eager but inexperienced leader of the shore party, (comprising his resentful deputy Lieutenant Kuhnecke and the sailors Vogel, Kranz, Lohrmann and Jahner), follows his orders regardless. In the trading post, the Factor is updating French-Canadian trapper Johnnie Barras (just back from eleven months in the wild) on the outbreak of war when Hirth and his men burst in, injuring the Eskimo servant, Nick. After an edgy night, a radio ham from Grand Rapids, Michigan, calls up for his regular chess game with the Factor and Johnnie shouts an alarm into the microphone. Jahner shoots him, and he later dies. Knowing that a seaplane will come to the post to investigate, the Nazis plan to hijack it and fly to the neutral U.S.A. They take the plane (with much loss of life), but Jahner is shot by an Eskimo marksman as it takes off. Kuhnecke misjudges the plane's fuel reserves and dies when it crashes into a lake, still well north of the 49th parallel. The four survivors come upon a Hutterite community of émigré Germans, led by Peter. The gentle Vogel befriends the fifteen-year-old Anna and, impressed by the community's spirit, volunteers to bake its bread. Hirth takes the Hutterites for secret Nazi sympathisers and openly appeals for their help at a general meeting, where Peter angrily refuses him. While Hirth, Kranz and Lohrmann prepare to move on, Peter persuades Vogel to stay on as the baker. But Hirth returns and summarily executes him for desertion. The three Nazis reach Winnipeg, and learn that the Mounties are on their trail. They set off for Vancouver, intending to take a Japanese boat to Russia. Mounties suspect their presence at the Indian Day celebrations in Banff, and Kranz is arrested when he panics and reveals his identity. Hirth and Lohrmann proceed on foot across the Rockies and stumble into the camp of Philip Armstrong Scott, an English aesthete and academic researching the history and culture of the Blackfoot Sioux. They respond to his hospitality by burning his paintings, books and research notes and tying him up, but he breaks free and captures Lohrmann. The wounded Hirth hops the freight car of a train heading for the U.S. border and overpowers fellow stowaway Andy Brock, an AWOL Canadian soldier. The train halts at Niagara Falls and Hirth identifies himself to the U.S. customs officers, demanding to be taken to the German embassy. But Brock persuades them to classify himself and Hirth as ""improperly manifested freight"" and to return his carriage to Canada. Now disarmed, Hirth is no match for Brock's fists...

A figure dressed all in black, with covered face and hat, aims a rifle with a telescopic sight with crosshairs at the cab from a distance and shoots at one tire to create an accident that nearly kills everyone. The taxi ends up on its side at the very edge of a high cliff, inches away from having fallen into crashing ocean waves below.Bob leaves his fares on the road and walks back to seek help. Ann and Gail try hitchhiking first, then sit in the middle of the road so a car is forced to stop, a sports car. In the car are banker Cosmo Topper (Roland Young) and his chauffeur Eddie (Eddie Rochester Anderson). The two girls brazenly climb into the car and insist on being driven to Anns destination, the Carrington Mansion. The sports car is so small that Gail must ride sitting on Cosmos lap.As they drive past Toppers residence, Mrs. Clara Topper (Billie Burke) sees her husband ride past with a curvaceous blond sitting on his lap, and distraughtly concludes he is having an adventure.The girls are dropped off at the stately cliff top mansion next door to Toppers residence, where they are received by three creepy staff members, butler Rama (Trevor Bardette), housekeeper Lillian (Rafaela Ottiano), and doctor Jeris (George Zucco).Dr. Jeris warns Ann that her father Henry Carrington (H. B. Warner) is in poor health and leads her into another room to meet him. In their conversation we find out that the next day would be Anns twenty first birthday, the day that, according to her mothers will and a trust fund, she is to come into full control of a fortune. Ann has no memories of her father, as they have been separated since her mother died in a cave in while she was inspecting the family mine together with a business partner.After meeting her father, Ann and Gail are shown to upstairs adjoining bedrooms. As Ann crosses the main hall, a heavy giant chandelier drops down, and she escapes harm because Gail screams in time for her to jump out of the way, being missed by inches. Anns bedroom is spectacularly decorated and Gail makes such a fuss about how beautiful it is that Ann insists that they trade beds, and Gail sleeps in what was supposedly Anns bed.In the middle of the night, a secret panel opens in Anns bedroom, the masked, hatted figure dressed all in black enters the bedroom, and Gail is knifed to death as she gets up to shut the window, evidently having been mistaken for Ann.Gails ghost separates from her body. Ghost-Gail slowly realizes she has been murdered instead of her friend Ann, and that someone in the house is guilty. She goes to the next mansion down the road, where Topper lives, to find someone who can both protect Ann and solve her own murder. At the next house she finds Topper, who can see her and talk to her, and convinces him to come to the Carrington mansion by threatening to make a terrible scandal with his wife if he doesnt.Topper uses the house phone to call Eddie the chauffeur, to get the car ready. Eddie grumbles protests but he does drive Topper to the next door mansion, not without experiencing, along the way, an enormous number of puzzles as doors open and shut, cushions depress, voices are heard, cigarettes smoke themselves, footprints appear on the walkways, and so on. Eventually he gets so scared that he drives back to Toppers and starts packing to leave. Mrs. Topper finds him and asks where Cosmo is, and wants to be driven to the house next door to find him.

                    The wealthiest man in the world, John P. Merrick, is a private person who likes to stay anonymous. One of his many assets, and a minor one at that, is Neeley's Department Store. There is labor unrest at the store, most of the employees' anger directed at Merrick, who they hang in effigy outside the store despite not knowing what he looks like. Merrick, not happy at what he sees going on, decides to go undercover working at the store to mete out the rabble-rousers. Undercover as Thomas Higgins, Merrick gets assigned as a sales clerk in the shoe department, where he is taken under the caring wing of his colleague Mary Jones, who sees in Higgins a poor man needing the guidance of friends. One of those other friends is Elizabeth Ellis, who Mary sees as a possible ""Mrs. Higgins"". Mary's boyfriend is Joe O'Brien, the chief organizer of the employees, four hundred of whom are following Joe in the charge against the store and Merrick. At the store, Merrick not only wants the list of the four hundred, but also wants to change those things he doesn't like at the store, chief amongst those being his shoe department section manager, Mr. Hooper. But as Higgins, Merrick also begins to see things a little differently, specifically from an employee's point of view.

Getting the dictator in his telescopic sight, he pulls the trigger on his unloaded rifle and gives a wave. He ponders a moment, then loads a live round, but is discovered at the last second by a guard, and the shot goes wild.After being beaten up, Thorndike is taken to Major Quive-Smith (George Sanders). Quive-Smith is also a devoted hunter and an admirer of Thorndike. Thorndike explains that it was a ""sporting stalk"", not to kill, but just for the thrill of going after the biggest game of all. The Nazi half-believes him, but insists he sign a confession that he was in fact working for His Majesty's government. When Thorndike refuses, he is tortured, but remains steadfast and warns of ""questions being asked in high places"" if he is killed, as his brother, Lord Risborough (Frederick Worlock), is a very important diplomat. The phrase gives Quive-Smith the idea to have Thorndike thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident.Thorndike survives when his knapsack gets caught in a tree, breaking his fall. He eludes his German pursuers and reaches a port. He steals a rowboat, but is forced to abandon it hastily when a patrol boat comes near. He swims to a Danish ship about to sail for London. Vaner (Roddy McDowall), the English cabin boy, helps Thorndike hide. The Germans find Thorndike's coat and passport aboard the rowboat and search the nearby ship. Though they find nothing, they place agent Mr. Jones (John Carradine) on board using Thorndike's passport to continue looking even after the ship leaves the harbor.Jones is met by German agents in London. Thorndike, mistakenly believing he is now safe, casually debarks and is spotted. He manages to shake off his pursuers by ducking into the apartment of Jerry Stokes (Joan Bennett), a young woman. Jerry lends him money so he can reach his brother.When Lord Risborough tells his brother that the British government, continuing its pre-war policy of appeasement, would have to extradite him if he were found, Thorndike decides to hide in Africa. Jerry tries to refuse a large cash reward, leading Lady Risborough (Heather Thatcher) to assume that it is payment for other services, but Thorndike insists. He also buys her a new hatpin, as she had lost hers when they first met. She chooses a cheap chromium arrow and insists Thorndike present it to her. Thorndike likens it to her, saying both are ""straight and shiny"". By this point, Jerry is in love.Quive-Smith arrives in London to join the hunt. When Thorndike calls on his solicitor, Saul Farnsworthy (Holmes Herbert), the Nazis are once again on his trail. Chased into a London Underground station, Thorndike struggles with Jones, who is killed when he is thrown onto an electrified rail.Thorndike tells Jerry to have Lord Risborough send him a letter in three weeks time care of Lyme Regis Post Office. Thorndike hides in a cave. However, when he goes to pick up the letter, the postmistress (Eily Malyon) seems alarmed and sends a girl on an errand. Thorndike grabs the letter and beats a hasty retreat. Back at his cave, he finds the letter is from Quive-Smith, who has followed him to his lair.Quive-Smith seals the only entrance and passes his quarry the confession and a pen through an air hole, threatening to leave him trapped inside.

    Synopsis
    On July 29, 1939, renowned British big game hunter Captain Alan Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon) slips through the forest undetected near the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's residence near Berchtesgaden. Getting the dictator in his telescopic sight, he pulls the trigger on his unloaded rifle and gives a wave. He ponders a moment, then loads a live round, but is discovered at the last second by a guard, and the shot goes wild.After being beaten up, Thorndike is taken to Major Quive-Smith (George Sanders). Quive-Smith is also a devoted hunter and an admirer of Thorndike. Thorndike explains that it was a ""sporting stalk"", not to kill, but just for the thrill of going after the biggest game of all. The Nazi half-believes him, but insists he sign a confession that he was in fact working for His Majesty's government. When Thorndike refuses, he is tortured, but remains steadfast and warns of ""questions being asked in high places"" if he is killed, as his brother, Lord Risborough (Frederick Worlock), is a very important diplomat. The phrase gives Quive-Smith the idea to have Thorndike thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident.Thorndike survives when his knapsack gets caught in a tree, breaking his fall. He eludes his German pursuers and reaches a port. He steals a rowboat, but is forced to abandon it hastily when a patrol boat comes near. He swims to a Danish ship about to sail for London. Vaner (Roddy McDowall), the English cabin boy, helps Thorndike hide. The Germans find Thorndike's coat and passport aboard the rowboat and search the nearby ship. Though they find nothing, they place agent Mr. Jones (John Carradine) on board using Thorndike's passport to continue looking even after the ship leaves the harbor.Jones is met by German agents in London. Thorndike, mistakenly believing he is now safe, casually debarks and is spotted. He manages to shake off his pursuers by ducking into the apartment of Jerry Stokes (Joan Bennett), a young woman. Jerry lends him money so he can reach his brother.When Lord Risborough tells his brother that the British government, continuing its pre-war policy of appeasement, would have to extradite him if he were found, Thorndike decides to hide in Africa. Jerry tries to refuse a large cash reward, leading Lady Risborough (Heather Thatcher) to assume that it is payment for other services, but Thorndike insists. He also buys her a new hatpin, as she had lost hers when they first met. She chooses a cheap chromium arrow and insists Thorndike present it to her. Thorndike likens it to her, saying both are ""straight and shiny"". By this point, Jerry is in love.Quive-Smith arrives in London to join the hunt. When Thorndike calls on his solicitor, Saul Farnsworthy (Holmes Herbert), the Nazis are once again on his trail. Chased into a London Underground station, Thorndike struggles with Jones, who is killed when he is thrown onto an electrified rail.Thorndike tells Jerry to have Lord Risborough send him a letter in three weeks time care of Lyme Regis Post Office. Thorndike hides in a cave. However, when he goes to pick up the letter, the postmistress (Eily Malyon) seems alarmed and sends a girl on an errand. Thorndike grabs the letter and beats a hasty retreat. Back at his cave, he finds the letter is from Quive-Smith, who has followed him to his lair.Quive-Smith seals the only entrance and passes his quarry the confession and a pen through an air hole, threatening to leave him trapped inside. Quive-Smith also slides in Jerry's beret with the arrow pin, informing Thorndike that his men murdered Jerry by throwing her out a window to her death when she would not betray him. They only discovered Thorndike's location through the address he had written down for her.

                    A highly fictionalized account of the life of George Armstrong Custer from his arrival at West Point in 1857 to his death at the battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876. He has little discipline at the academy but is prepared to stand up to the senior cadet, Ned Sharp, who makes his life miserable. While there he catches the eye of the commandant, Col. (later General) Phil Sheridan and also meets his future bride, Elizabeth Bacon. Graduating early due to the Civil War, it is only through a chance meeting with General Winfield Scott that he finally gets assigned to a cavalry regiment. He served with distinction during the war and when he is promoted to Brigadier General in error, he leads his troops in a decisive victory. He has little to do after the war turning down lucrative positions in private industry and it's his wife who arranges with Gen. Scott for him to be appointed a Lt. Colonel and given command of the 7th Cavalry. He is depicted as a friend of the Indians who will fight for injustice, in the form of his old nemesis Ned Sharp who is taking advantage of them and trying to provoke a war with his own financial gain in mind. Custer died in the the now famous battle on June 25, 1876 at the age of 36.

                    The EIGHTH and final movie featuring Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland is definitely not an accurate History lesson; it is, instead, a retelling of the Custer myth - with the added sheen of magnetic stars, colorful (and even distinguished) character parts and rousing action sequences. Most of the first half of this long movie has a refreshing comic element as Custer bungles and brawls his way through West Point; the start of the American Civil War introduces some well shot and convincing battle scenes; the final part of the picture covers Custer's achievements with the fabled 7th Cavalry in the Dakota Territories. The romantic relationship between Flynn and De Havilland's characters touchingly links the different segments - both were instinctively aware that this was their last picture together and it gave their shared scenes a special poignancy. Throughout the movie, Custer is represented as a noble and heroic figure - so devoid of cunning and guile that he is almost bound to make a less than brilliant strategist. A completely ficticious plot-line turns him into a defender of Native American lands as unscrupulous businessmen conspire to start a war between the USA and the Sioux Nation. Ultimately, Custer and his regiment are forced to intercept the Sioux and their allies. Destiny awaits them at The Little Big Horn.

To please Elinor he and his sidekick Jonathan G. ""Goldie"" Locke (Allen Jenkins) agree to open a brokerage firm on Wall Street, but when Elinor asks him to go to a swanky soiree hosted by Maxine Wood (Gladys Cooper) to mingle with potential clients Gay refuses and after one day on Wall Street is ready for retirement. Gay returns home from the office to find the beautiful Helen Reed (Wendy Barrie) waiting to see him. Helen is the secretary of Wood and on her employer's behalf invites The Falcon to the same party Elinor wanted him to go to. She goes on to explain that some of Wood's parties have been plagued by jewel thefts and Maxine is particularly concerned about a diamond owned by Mrs Vera Gardner (Lucile Gleason) one of the guests. Unable to resist Gay accompanies Elinor to the party while instructing Goldie to infiltrate the event too.However, Elinor becomes angry when she realises why Gay changed his mind about attending the party and retaliates by dancing with one of the other guests Manuel Retana (Turhan Bey). In frustration, she grabs the flower from Retana's lapel and flings it at Gay. He calmly picks it up and attaches it to his lapel. Gardner then insists on dancing with Gay and while they are dancing she hands him her diamond secretly. Her action puzzles Gay greatly but before he can ask her about it she leaves the room. Moments later, a shot rings out, and she falls to the floor dead. The killer is seen by Goldie as he makes his getaway. Unfortunately, when the police arrive Detectives Bates (Edward Brophy) and Grimes (Eddie Dunn) arrest Goldie as a material witness as he was the only person in the room where Mrs Gardner was killed. Gay follows Goldie to the police station where he speaks to Inspector Mike Waldeck (Arthur Shields) and manages to convince him to release Goldie to act as bait to lure the killer out into the open.Helen meets them at the station and the three of them head off to Maxine's apartment to question her. They leave Goldie waiting in the car but while they are with Maxine, Goldie is snatched from the car by the killer Noel Weber (Damian O'Flynn). Gay tells Maxine that he suspects that Mrs Gardner was involved with a gang of jewel thieves led by Retana. Meanwhile, Weber takes Goldie to a nearby pinball parlour and orders him to phone The Falcon and make him an offer - the diamond for Goldie's life. As Goldie begins dialling the number a shot is fired and Weber falls down dead and when the police arrive they find Goldie with a dead body for the second time and re-arrest him. The Falcon returns home where Bates tells him that Goldie is once again being held on suspicion of murder and that Waldeck wants to speak to Gay back at Headquarters. Gay manages to give Bates the slip and the following day, while disguised as a tramp, he tries to apologise to Elinor who is furious because he left with Helen. She icily informs him that she has a date with Retana later that evening and never wants to see Gay again.By this point, Gay suspects Gardner must have arranged to have her diamond ""stolen"" so she could collect on the insurance. The flower was a signal, indicating to whom Gardner was to give the jewel. It should have been Retana but Elinor throwing it at Gay upset the scheme. Suspicious of Retana, Gay and Helen break into his apartment, but when he returns unexpectedly halfway through their search they are forced to hide outside on the patio. They observe Retana as he checks a secret compartment hidden behind a wall panel. Once Retana leaves Gay reaches behind the panel and finds the gun that killed Weber. Gay goes to the city morgue to examine the body of Weber and recognises him as the man pictured with Retana in a photograph he found during the search of his apartment. Meanwhile, as the police interrogate Goldie, Helen bursts in and confesses to Weber's murder and presents the Detectives with the gun from Retana's place. Once the police have identified the weapon as being that that killed Weber, Helen tells them all about Retana and tells them to go to the club where he is due to dine with Elinor. Gay phones Elinor at the club to warn her that the police are coming to pick up her host, but she thinks that Gay is trying to frame Retana because he is jealous so she warns him that the police are on their way. When The Falcon returns to his home he finds an armed Retana has tied up his manservant Jerry (Willie Fong) and is demanding the diamond, but when Helen unexpectedly appears at the door Retana thinks it is the police and flees.Meanwhile, back at the club Bates has arrested Elinor for obstruction and when she phones Gay from the police station he instructs Waldeck to meet him at Maxine Wood's apartment. There Maxine tells them that her life has been threatened, prompting Gay and Waldeck to promise to stay the night to protect her. Maxine retires for the night while the two guard her bedroom door, but Retana slips in through the bedroom window and threatens her. Gay and Waldeck break into the room but before they can get to Retana he collapses to the floor dead with a hypodermic needle laying by his side. Mike assumes he has committed suicide but Gay sees Maxine try to crush the hypo with her foot in order to destroy any fingerprint evidence. The Falcon declares that Maxine killed Retana, that she was married to Weber and the three of them comprised the jewellery theft ring. He goes on to explain that when she and Weber tried to double-cross Retana, he killed Weber and was about to do the same to her before she killed him with the hypodermic needle. Waldeck is amazed at how The Falcon has come to that conclusion but Gay explains that he was tipped off when Goldy was snatched from the car outside Maxine's apartment as she was the only person who could have known where he was at that exact moment and thus she must have been involved with the ring.They then all return to the police station where they release Elinor, but just as she is about to forgive Gay an attractive young woman arrives and asks The Falcon for his help in solving another crime.","

                    Edna marries Texan Sam Gladney, operator of a wheat mill. Edna discovers by chance how the law treats children who are without parents and decides to do something about it. She opens a home for foundlings and orphans and begins to place children in good homes, despite the opposition of ""conservative"" citizens, who would condemn illegitimate children for being born out of wedlock. Eventually Edna leads a fight in the Texas legislature to remove the stigma of illegitimacy from birth records in that state, while continuing to be an advocate for homeless children.

                    A semi-fictionalized account of Edna Gladney is presented. This phase of her story begins in the early 1900s in Wisconsin, where Edna grew up, on the day she would meet who would become her husband, Sam Gladney, their marriage despite she already being engaged to another man at the time. Sam was just beginning his career in the flour business back in his native Texas, his business fortunes which would rise and fall over his life. Edna and Sam would have a son, but upon his death would eventually learn that Edna could bore no more children. To overcome her grief, Sam wanted to adopt, specifically the child of a young woman who worked at his flour mill and who could not both work, which she needed to do to survive financially, and keep care of the child. As a compromise, Edna decided to keep the child during the day, which led to her opening a day care center. Upon learning the plight of children given away largely due to being born out of wedlock they who are marketed largely as commodities instead of human beings, Edna would open a children's aid society to try and find loving homes for these children, who live with the stigma of being officially listed as illegitimate. Based on a story of a young woman who comes into the aid society and who seems to be headed in the same direction of Edna's own adopted sister Charlotte's tragic path, Edna begins her fight to have the word ""illegitimate"" stricken from the official documentation of such children in Texas, her assertion being that there are no illegitimate children, only illegitimate parents.

Looking at a portrait of his wife (Betty Compson) on the wall, he is informed that dinner is served. Kessler speaks to an empty chair at one end of the table (as addressing his wife) and sits at opposite end of the table. Evans comes to serve soup to him but is told to always serve Mrs. Kessler first. He apologizes and goes to the empty chair, pretending to serve. Then looking for approval from Kessler, he returns and serves him soup. As he leaves the room he is approached by Kesslers daughter Virginia (Polly Ann Young) who asks how he is taking it. She is told he is taking it well when the door buzzer sounds. Virginia announces she will answer it. Ralph (John McGuire) enters and she tells him he was told not to come. She takes him into the library to explain, but he notices Kessler speaking to an empty chair and observes. She joins him and they go into the library where she tells him that this happens once a year. Looking up, Ralph sees the maid Cecile (Terry Walker) standing with a coat. His expression reveals recognition of Cecile. She gives the coat to Virginia, who leaves with Ralph. Cecile enters the kitchen and begins asking Evans about Ralph and Virginia. She is told to mind her business. She asks about the unsolved murders and Evans tells the gardener Jules (Ernie Adams) he opened his mouth too much. Evans takes Cecile out of the room and Jules takes something from the refrigerator and places it in a bag. Going to the gardening shed, he enters and lights a lamp. He raises a trap door and descends to a room below where Mrs. Kessler has been staying. Urging her to eat her supper, she rises and recalls a car accident, saying she cant go home. He tells her he must go home and leaves. Jules tells his wife Mrs. Mason (Ottola Nesmith as Ollola Nesmith) that he was late because he couldnt get away from Mrs. Kessler. She insists that he should tell Mr. Kessler about his wife but he says that it would kill him. She says maybe Mrs. Kessler had something to do with the murders and that she hasnt been right since the accident with the man who was killed. He denies that, saying she is harmless and that they should never tell anyone. Then he supposes that if anyone should find out he is hiding her, they might suspect him of the murders. Ralph and Virginia return and he bids her goodnight. Offering to put her car in the garage, he is told that Evans will do it. When Evans comes out to move the car, he sees and overhears a conversation between Cecile and Ralph. She tells him that he didnt answer her letters and calls and that he better not leave her for the Kessler girl or anyone. He tells her that he doesnt love her and that no one will stand in the way of his happiness. She threatens to tell about them and he leaves. Virginia tells her father she is in love and that Ralph will soon ask her to marry him. Kessler congratulates her and she goes up to bed. When Evans comes in, Kessler asks about the bandage wrapped around his hand. He tells him that he hurt it putting up the car. Kessler takes him upstairs, dresses the wound and rebandages it. Kessler says he will read before going to bed. Evans retires for the evening. Mrs. Kessler comes out of the shed and stands below his window. At the same time, Kessler knowingly rises and goes to look out the window at her below. She tells him that she cant come home, because he would kill her. He would kill anybody. A trance comes over him and when he looks again, she is gone. He wanders out in a daze and makes his way to Ceciles room, entering and removing his robe. He approaches and covers her with the robe. She screams as the radio plays. Next morning Evans goes to her room and hears the radio playing an exercise program. He knocks repeatedly and calls her name, suggesting she can exercise in the kitchen. Getting no response, he opens the door and finds her dead. He goes immediately to inform Mr. Kessler. He tells Evans to phone the police. Lieutenant Williams (George Pembroke) is questioning everyone about the murders. He says Cecile was killed the same way as the others with no fingerprints. The only evidence is a letter she had telling her not to see him, signed Ralph. Hearing this, Virginia is startled and says she is practically engaged to a Ralph. Asking Evans if he saw anything suspicious the night before, he hesitates and is urged by the police. He reports overhearing the conversation between Cecile and Ralph where he threatened her. Newspaper headlines proclaim Ralph accused of murder. Ralph confesses to Kessler and Virginia that he cannot account for his whereabouts at the time of the murder. At the trial Virginia hears testimony that Cecile was frequently seen at Ralphs apartment and that the landlady thought they were married. After several people testify, we are shown the newspaper headline saying Ralph is sentenced to death. Virginia tells Ralph that they will appeal to the governor. When the governor refuses to help without new evidence, Ralph is executed. The next day Evans answers the door and is startled to see a man in the spitting image of Ralph, who introduces himself and enters. Kessler and Virginia are also startled when he introduces himself as Ralphs brother Paul (John McGuire). He asks to speak to them.Evans seems in a daze as he goes to the kitchen and asks Jules if he looks pale. He freezes and doesnt respond to the servants buzzer until Jules prompts him. As he approaches the table and is told to bring coffee, he stares at Paul until informed that he is Ralphs brother. Paul is reassured by Kessler that he is welcome to stay there as long as he wants. Kessler goes to prepare a room for him and shows him to it. Mrs. Kessler again comes to the window and Kessler is strangely drawn to look. Going again trance-like Kessler approaches Evans to kill him but turns away after Evans leaves the room. Instead Kessler goes to the kitchen where he finds and kills Jules. The next morning the body is discovered by Evans who phones the police. He informs Kessler that the gardener has been murdered. The police arrive and begin questioning everyone. Told that they have a new houseguest, an officer is sent to retrieve him. Paul comes downstairs and is directed by Ryan (Fred Kelsey) into the kitchen. Again police are surprised at his resemblance to Ralph. Paul tries to question Evans and then the lieutenant about the murders and is told they can make no headway. Kessler takes a phone call telling him to come to the coroners office. While speaking with the coroner (Robert Strange) Mrs. Mason comes in and asks to see the body. She is left alone while the coroner returns to talk with Kessler. They hear a scream and return to the morgue where Mrs. Mason says he moved. Kessler tries to get Jules to say who tried to kill him, but when he sees Kessler he dies of fright before he can say anything. As they discuss what happened, Evans begins serving dinner, explaining that the new cook is having trouble getting started. In the kitchen the new cook remarks how she hopes she can do a good job. Evans asks her if she has read the papers to which she says no. After dinner a game of chess is played by Kessler and Paul, who wins. Evans calls Kessler, explaining that the cook wants to quit. He agrees to speak to her. Paul and Virginia go upstairs to their rooms. Kessler convinces the cook to stay on. Returning to review his chess moves, he is drawn to the window where his wife peers in as the rain pours down. Meanwhile Virginia retires to bed. Kessler, in a trance starts to go back toward the kitchen as lightning strikes. This seems to alter his plan. He goes upstairs and goes to Pauls door. Hesitating, Paul hears someone at the door and goes to listen. Kessler redirects to his daughters room and prepares to kill her. When lightning strikes again he is awakened from his trance and leaves her room. As he goes downstairs, Paul follows him into the library. Staring out the window, Paul asks if he is all right. Although somewhat confused, he tells Paul that he is all right and needs nothing. Paul leaves for his room and Kessler sits to read. Again he is drawn to the window where his wifes face puts him into a trance. He reaches out to the window but she is gone. The next morning Paul, Virginia and Kessler come downstairs and notice that the portrait has been slashed. He wonders if anyone was hurt. In the kitchen he questions Evans who tells him the cook was going shopping that morning. Finding her room empty, they notice her coming in with groceries.

Both issues eventually become apparent to Miss Fiske, who cannot tolerate how Emily and Louisa disrupt her home life. However, Ellen ""convinces"" Miss Fiske to take an extended leave from the house, while Ellen tells her sisters that she bought the house from Miss Fiske, which the sisters are not to tell anyone else. The secrets that Ellen is keeping about the situation threatens to bring her and her sisters' lives down when they receive a visit from their distant nephew Albert Feather, a cad who has his own financial well being as his main priority.

The presiding judge, Cornelia Porter, a fair and officious woman, grants the divorce and in the process awards Adele $4,000 a month in alimony for five years, that judgment to be reviewed at the end of the period unless Adele remarries, at which time alimony would end. J.M. is incensed by the settlement. Jeff Sherman, a reporter who J.M. recently fired, convinces J.M. to allow him to enact a plan to mire Judge Porter in a scandal related to her own personal conduct of a relationship matter that would force her to hear J.M.'s appeal of the settlement. Jeff is able to negotiate the deal on his own terms, which not only includes his job back, but to get the specific posting he wants and an unlimited expense account. Part of Jeff's plan is to woo Cornelia, who would in turn fall in love with him. But Jeff runs into many obstacles in the plan succeeding including J.M. balking at what ends up being Jeff's exorbitant expenses, one of those larger payments to another integral player in the plan, Jeff's manicurist friend Dotty, who is solely out for herself. But the biggest obstacles may be Jeff's playbook which is full of clichés which may not work on a woman like Cornelia, and he having a change of heart the more he gets to know her and have feelings for her.

Rigas persuades Dan to submit to tests, where Dan absorbs increasingly powerful charges until he develops an amazing degree of immunity, and becomes a walking hulk of electricity. Rigas does a final test of pouring a tremendous charge into Dan's body, and Dan becomes superhuman and his body glows. He is also a robot that is controlled by Rigas. When Lawrence tries to stop the experiment, Rigas orders Dan to kill him. Rigas removes the electricity from Dan's body and he becomes a shrunken shell. Despite the efforts of June Meredith, Lawrence's niece, and newspaper reporter Mark Adams to help him, Dan is sentenced to die in the electric chair. But in the death-chamber he absorbs three shocks which returns him to superhuman status. He escapes and goes after Rigas, after putting on a rubber suit to encase his electric energy.

    Synopsis
    After the main title and opening credits, the audience enters Texas Tommys drive-in greasy-spoon on Texas State Highway 73 (Texas Tommys slogan is Service with a Song) where the carhop sisters, Kay and Barbara Latimer, sing What Can I Do for You? A much anticipated letter from a lawyer arrives. Together with their Aunt Sue, the drive-ins cook, the sisters open the letter to discover they have inherited $55,000. They are ecstatic until they learn that their share after court cost, lawyer fees, and taxes is only $4,287.96. Terribly disappointed, they decide to invest the money by heading to Miami, the millionaires playground, to look for husbands.
The next scene is a Miami travelogue as an off-screen chorus sings Oh Me, Oh Mi-ami. Kay, dressed in finery that looks like they spent most of their inheritance on her outfit, Barbara, as Miss Sears, Kays secretary and Aunt Sue, as Kays maid, arrive at their bungalow. They sing and dance their version of Oh Me, Oh Mi-ami.
Jack, one of the resorts waiters, delivers champagne compliments of Mr. Jeffrey Bolton. During Jacks visit to their bungalow, he flirts with Aunt Sue. He also agrees to help Kay discern the difference between male fortune hunters and actual millionaires.
Kay telephones Mr. Bolton to thank him for the champagne, but complains about its flatness. When Jeffrey comes over to check out the problem, he is so impressed with Kay that he invites her to a party at his suite, where most of the guests are asleep (the party has been going for days). Once the band leaves after having played for sixteen hours, Jeff plays the piano and sings You Started Something. Another band arrives and joins in as Kay sings. After a short duet by Jeff and Kay, she performs a cute seated tap routine with the Condos Brothers.
Kay meets Phil, apparently another wealthy playboy, at the party. Thereafter throughout the film, Jeff tries to get Kay away from Phil or visa versa. When Phil and Kay dance at the party, Phil sings a reprise of You Started Something. In the following scene, while Phil and Kay drive in a convertible, Phil sings Ive Got You All to Myself, but Jeff pops up in the backseat.
The next few scenes were quite obviously not shot in Miami a speed boat chase between the two guys was filmed in Lake Eloise and the grounds of Cypress Gardens, near Winter Haven, Florida, while Phil and Kay are shown at Silver Springs, near Ocala, Florida and, Phils and Kays romantic underwater tête-à-tête was filmed at Rainbow Springs in Dunnellon, Florida all three locales are hundreds of miles north of Miami.

Both the proposal and its acceptance are a bit of a surprise since Philip seemed to encourage a relationship between his childhood friend, Ward Andrews, and Stella. Stella seemed equally as interested in pursuing that relationship with Ward. After Stella and Philip get married, Philip assumes the lead management role in the family's steel business, which had previously been run by his mother following his father's death. The way that he runs the business and the marriage bring to the surface insecurities in Philip. Philip's behavior becomes increasingly erratic, which belies the true nature of what Philip's plans are for himself, Ward and Stella. A Dr. Rameau, who knew Philip when Philip was passing through Paris, may be able to shed some light on the proceedings.

                    Climaxing a long series of mysterious disappearances of young girls, dancer Thalia Arnold is found murdered. Police-detective Captain McVeigh believes that King Peterson, a nightclub operator and owner of the Crescent School of Fine Arts, knows something about the missing girls. Peterson's silent partner is Joseph Thompson, a theatrical agent, whose daughter, Nora, a reporter, is waging a newspaper crusade against the district attorney's office for failing to trace the girls, much to the discomfiture of James Horton, a young assistant district attorney. Pauline Randolph is the next to disappear but Nora had seen her leaving her grandmother's home in a car driven by a blonde woman. Nora interviews the grandmother who tells her that Pauline had theatrical employment, along with one of her friends, Mary Phillips. When the police begin investigating the Crescent talent-school, Thompson, who knew the Arnold girl intimately, quarrels with Peterson over the school, which, Thompson claims, will land them both in jail. In a lineup of all the showgirls from Peterson's nightclubs, Mary tries to identify the mysterious blonde who picked her and Pauline up, but she is unable to do so. The blonde, Kate Neslon, telephones Horton to come to her apartment and she will give him information about the missing girls, but he and Captain McVeigh find her dead in her apartment. Nora, who thinks Peterson doesn't know she is Thompson's daughter, decides to audition for the School of Missing Girls.

                    Caroline Mason, on vacation with her father Mr. Bliss in Idaho, has fallen in love with gaucho Paco Del Valle, the two who plan to get married. The problem is is that she's already married, for five years, to New York publisher Anthony Mason, who couldn't go along on this trip since he had to work. Caroline admits that she loves Anthony, but she believes she is no longer in love with him. Conversely, Anthony still loves his wife and he believes she truly still is in love with him. This situation is somewhat déjà vu, as rather than follow the old adage ""love makes the heart grow fonder"", Caroline tends to forget easily those with who she has lost contact, including Anthony. This situation is reminiscent of one two years earlier when on vacation in Florida with her father, Caroline was ready to marry Paul Martindale. But Anthony, who had more than a sneaking suspicion of what Caroline was up to, decided to come to Florida to outmaneuver the game that Caroline and Paul had concocted to tell him to get what they wanted without rancor. The problem for Caroline and Paul in that situation was that they had no idea that they were indeed embroiled in a game with Anthony until it was all over. But will this situation with Paco be any different?
