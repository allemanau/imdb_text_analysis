                    At the Macy's Department Store Thanksgiving Day parade, the actor playing Santa is discovered to be drunk by a whiskered old man. Doris Walker, the no nonsense special events director, persuades the old man to take his place. The old man proves to be a sensation and is quickly recruited to be the store Santa at the main Macy's outlet. While he is successful, Ms. Walker learns that he calls himself Kris Kringle and he claims to be the actual Santa Claus. Despite reassurances by Kringle's doctor that he is harmless, Doris still has misgivings, especially when she has cynically trained herself, and especially her daughter, Susan, to reject all notions of belief and fantasy. And yet, people, especially Susan, begin to notice there is something special about Kris and his determination to advance the true spirit of Christmas amidst the rampant commercialism around him and succeeding in improbable ways. When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent psychologist erupts, Kris finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberately fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' friend, Fred Gaily, reassures Kris of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact Santa Claus. What ensues is a bizarre hearing in which people's beliefs are reexamined and put to the test, but even so, it's going to take a miracle for Kris to win.

                    One of Doris Walker's responsibilities at Macy's Department Store in New York City is to organize the famed annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which marks the official start of the Christmas shopping season. Doris is a realist, that attitude toward life due to her own failed marriage not being the fairy tale she envisioned it would be. She has taught her impressionable six year old daughter Susan Walker the same, Susan who does not believe in make believe or the ""fantasies"" associated with Christmas, such as Santa Claus. At the last minute, Doris is forced to hire a replacement Santa for the parade, not knowing anything about the man she hires besides he looking the part. He is such a success that she hires him to play Santa in the store for the remainder of the Christmas season. It isn't until he becomes an invaluable addition to Macy's, including coming to the positive attention of Mr. Macy himself, that Doris learns that the man calls himself Kris Kringle and truly does believe he is the real Santa Claus. At this point, Susan, witnessing things she can not explain rationally, begins to wonder if he is who he says he is. To protect herself and the store, Doris, without telling Kris what she is truly doing, makes Kris go through a psychological evaluation through the store's therapist, Granville Sawyer, who wrongly believes he's God's gift to his profession. Because of their antagonism toward each other, Sawyer tries to have Kris committed, which leads to court proceedings as to Kris' sanity. Fred Gailey, Doris' neighbor who is attracted to her, takes Kris' case, in part to be close to Doris, but also to help his friend who he believes is just a kindly and harmless old man. Fred's defense is to prove that Kris is who he says he is: Santa Claus. In the process, Kris wants more than anything to make both Doris and Susan believe in faith, for Doris again and for Susan the first time in her life.

She pays him no mind and at the department store, he's proving be popular as well. He seems to be able to speak many languages and knows just what kids would like to have and creates a bit of a sensation when he refers shoppers to other stores rather than Macy's. When Kris has a run-in with the Department store's psychological tester, the man tries to have him committed leading to a court case where Doris' lawyer neighbor Fred Gailey tries to prove in court that Kris is the real Santa Claus. More important to Kris throughout all of this is to get Doris and her daughter Susan to believe in him.

"3","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039152/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","A man on horseback is being chased by gunmen who shoot at him. He outruns them, and races across gorgeous scenery in an arid landscape. Quirt Evans (John Wayne) falls from his faltering horse.A beautiful girl Penelope Worth (Gail Russell) and her father Thomas Worth (John Halloran) see him fall and approach to rescue him, as he is wounded.Before accepting attention to his wound, Quirt insists on going to the telegraph office, where he sends a telegram to claim some land and have it recorded in his name. When he gives his name, the town telegrapher Bradley (Olin Howland) recognizes him as a notorious gunfighter. Quirt loses consciousness and falls into Penelope's arms.Penelope and her father take Quirt to their home and send for the doctor.Dr. Mangram (Tom Powers) gives Quirt laudanum to anesthetize him, but Quirt remains very restless while unconscious, until the father realizes he is instinctively reaching for his gun. After the gun is emptied of bullets, it is put in Quirt's hand and that relaxes him so the bullet is extracted and his wound is cleaned and bandaged.Dr.. Mangram is a pragmatic atheist who immediately recommends that the family should get Quirt out of their house, but the family refuses because it is their duty as Quakers to tend to the wounded man.Quirt sleeps in bed for two whole days. While Penelope watches over him, he talks in his sleep about gunfights and women, especially one named Lila.In the kitchen, Penelope asks her mother (Irene Rich) about how she met her father, and how they fell in love.When Quirt wakes, and hears a noise, he gropes for his gun, which is under the pillow and rises, gun in hand to face a startled Penelope.Quirt's earlier lifestyle of fast draws, fast women, booze, bar fights, and so on doesn't bother the family as they believe there is good that can be nurtured in every person.Quirt gets stronger and relishes the mother's sausages, eggs, donuts and cakes that melt in your mouth.In town, telegrapher Bradley brags about having a long friendship with Quirt, because Quirt is notorious and feared by everyone in the territory, though he only saw him once when he sent off the telegram.Laredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot) and two henchmen, the gang who had shot Quirt a few days back, come looking for him, question Bradley, and eventually approach the Quaker home.When Quirt is aware of Laredo's presence outside the house, he jumps out of bed and dresses and gets his gun but it has no bullets, as Mr. Worth had emptied it. Talking tough, he bluffs, holding the gang off with his unloaded gun. Laredo wants the land Quirt had secured, and Quirt agrees to sell for twenty thousand dollars and signs a deed. Laredo hands over five thousand, promising to give the rest of the money later when Quirt comes over to collect.Quirt is respectful of the Quaker family's ways, he hangs his holstered gun outside, never allowing it inside. Exposure to the ways of the Quakers starts to change not only gunfighter Quirt but also the cynical, atheistic doctor who attends to him, grumbling all the time.When Quirt is able, he helps the family in their farm work, and is very grateful for their loving care.For Penelope, it has been virtually love at first sight. Quirt develops feelings for her as they chat about each other, farm work, and Quaker beliefs.In little time, Quirt kisses her, and she reacts ecstatically.They are interrupted by territorial Marshal Wistful McClintock (Harry Carey) who questions Quirt about his recent whereabouts. Penelope's statement that he hasn't been outside the farm for days is totally believed, but the marshal warns about his habits and promises he will be watching closely.Quirts romantic feelings can't help but increase.At one point Penelope confesses her love for Quirt, and is surprised he doesn't feel the same: ""I never thought it could happen to one and not another."" Her outright innocence is incredibly touching and endearing, and affects Quirt deeply.Quirt doesn't want to let the love take over because of the life that he leads and because he will be out looking for revenge on the people who shot him. The tug of his old ways is still strong.Quirt's reputation as a gunslinger comes in very handy in settling a dispute with a neighbor who has diverted water that used to flow toward the Quaker settlement. Neighbor Frederick Carson (Paul Hurst) is convinced by Quirt by the power of his menacing reputation, to ""be a good neighbor"" and remove the top two boards holding back water that used to flow into flumes and irrigation ditches.Nevertheless it is the genuine and uncritical welcome the old man subsequently receives from the Worths that converts him from obnoxious neighbor into friend. As Carson is happily taking home a basket of pies and donuts from Mrs. Worth, he remarks to the as yet vacillating Quirt, about how good helping his neighbors makes him feel.As Quirt stays with the family longer, their life becomes more attractive to him.On the way to a surprise arranged for him at a [Quaker] meeting, Quirt is seen by the passing Randy McCall (Lee Dixon), who is an old friend and former partner in crime. Randy reverses course and goes along.At the meeting, the Quaker group thanks Quirt publicly for solving the water problem, and is given a Bible. Randy is impressed, then enthralled by the Bible given to Quirt, and takes to reading it out loud at any opportunity.During the gathering, the young and handsome local blacksmith approaches Penelope and his interest in courting and marrying her is obvious. Quirt becomes jealous but isn't ready to take responsibilities.Randy takes Quirt aside after the ceremony and tells him that he knows that Laredo is planning to rustle a large herd as it is driven through a nearby valley the next day.Quirt, overwhelmed by the Quakers' gratitude, and convinced that he isn't good for Penelope, takes the opportunity to get away and try a return to his old life. He takes the blacksmith aside and tells him to quit stalling and marry Penelope, and immediately departs with Randy.The Laredo gang's attempt to rustle the herd is foiled by Quirt and Randy and another friend. First there are galloping horses, guns blazing, falls from horses, and a stampede, as Laredo attacks, but then Quirts gang comes from behind and one by one picks off the rustlers by using long wooden clubs.Next we see Randy and Quirt drinking at a saloon and casino in Red Rock, where Lila (Joan Barton) is entertaining with her singing. Quirt is no longer the old Quirt. He gambles and wins a pile of chips that he gives to Lila as a goodbye present in honor of their old relationship. Then he picks a fight with a group drinking at the bar by rudely pushing them aside and yelling ""More Whiskey!"" to start a massive saloon brawl.He makes it back to the Worth farm and wants to resume with Penelope.McClintock is not convinced of his desire to reform. He remarks ""I'm patient, that's what hangs all you fellas in the end, I'm patient"", although his regard for Quirts reputation is almost respectful: ""You know Quirt, I always figured on usin' a new rope in hangin' you"". McClintock keeps dropping by to see Quirt and to interrogate him, reminding Quirt that he is going to enjoy hanging him and is waiting for a showdown with Laredo so that he can ""... hang the winner"".Later, when he takes Penelope on a buckboard wagon to pick blackberries, Quirt leaves his gun behind in deference to her wishes. The scene where the two pick blackberries is a romantic idyll, which ends abruptly when Laredo and his gang spot them from a distance and menacingly approach in galloping horses.Outnumbered, without a gun, and with Penelope at his side, there is no option but to run, and there follows a thrilling chase of a wagon on a road being pursued by men on horseback. Quirt maneuvers and takes jumps and steep and narrow paths, one man collides with a tree branch, but eventually his wagon runs off a ledge and falls from a great height into a deep narrow river.Quirt manages to swim to hide below the rocks, pulling an unconscious Penelope with him. Laredo looks upon the scene from a height a few moments later, and assumes Quirt has drowned.Later, Quirt walks into the Worth farm carrying the unconscious Penelope in his arms, and the doctor is called. The prognosis is bad, the skeptical doctor takes up his sermonizing as to how dangerous Quirt is to those around him, and how frustrating his profession is, that he works to patch up people who keep on doing dangerous things and being hurt again and again.Quirt, who believes he is losing the great love of his life, wants revenge, and goes into town to face Laredo when he is told Laredo is in the saloon.He enters one end of town, walking alone, the townspeople scatter. Laredo is shocked to be told Quirt is at the other end of town, inviting him to come out. First he sends one of his henchmen to peek out to verify. Then, he decides to take another swig of a whisky bottle, and waits.Meantime, Penelope has recovered consciousness, and, weak as she is, demands to be driven to town in the wagon, lying down.The Worth wagon arrives on the scene. Penelope insists on trying to talk Quirt out of violence. Quirt turns his back to the saloon to talk to her, just as Laredo emerges. In part to protect Penelope who would be in the line of fire, Quirt drops his gun and turns to face Laredo weaponless.It might have been a sad finale, were it not for the vigilant McClintock, who has his rifle pointed at Laredo from a distance, and shoots as he sees Laredo reach for his gun.So the bad guys die by causes that are natural to them, namely bullets, but Quirt doesn't do the shooting.As Quirt departs on his way home with the Worths, the Marshal picks up Quirt's gun and announces he will hang it in his office along with a new rope, in memory of the adversary who never was.","
    
                    Notorious gunman Quirt Evans is wounded and on the run. He arrives at a Quaker farm owned by Thomas Worth and his family where he collapses from exhaustion. Evans asks Thomas and his daughter Penelope to drive him into town in their wagon in order to send an urgent telegram. The telegram contains a land claim and is sent to the land recorder's office. The Quaker family is ignoring the town doctor's advice to rid themselves of the gunfighter and they compassionately tend to the delirious Evans. Penny Worth becomes intrigued by his ravings of past loves.When Evans regains consciousness, Penny explains to him about the Quaker credo of non-violence and way of life.

Quirt Evans (John Wayne) falls from his faltering horse.A beautiful girl Penelope Worth (Gail Russell) and her father Thomas Worth (John Halloran) see him fall and approach to rescue him, as he is wounded.Before accepting attention to his wound, Quirt insists on going to the telegraph office, where he sends a telegram to claim some land and have it recorded in his name. When he gives his name, the town telegrapher Bradley (Olin Howland) recognizes him as a notorious gunfighter. Quirt loses consciousness and falls into Penelope's arms.Penelope and her father take Quirt to their home and send for the doctor.Dr. Mangram (Tom Powers) gives Quirt laudanum to anesthetize him, but Quirt remains very restless while unconscious, until the father realizes he is instinctively reaching for his gun. After the gun is emptied of bullets, it is put in Quirt's hand and that relaxes him so the bullet is extracted and his wound is cleaned and bandaged.Dr.. Mangram is a pragmatic atheist who immediately recommends that the family should get Quirt out of their house, but the family refuses because it is their duty as Quakers to tend to the wounded man.Quirt sleeps in bed for two whole days. While Penelope watches over him, he talks in his sleep about gunfights and women, especially one named Lila.In the kitchen, Penelope asks her mother (Irene Rich) about how she met her father, and how they fell in love.When Quirt wakes, and hears a noise, he gropes for his gun, which is under the pillow and rises, gun in hand to face a startled Penelope.Quirt's earlier lifestyle of fast draws, fast women, booze, bar fights, and so on doesn't bother the family as they believe there is good that can be nurtured in every person.Quirt gets stronger and relishes the mother's sausages, eggs, donuts and cakes that melt in your mouth.In town, telegrapher Bradley brags about having a long friendship with Quirt, because Quirt is notorious and feared by everyone in the territory, though he only saw him once when he sent off the telegram.Laredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot) and two henchmen, the gang who had shot Quirt a few days back, come looking for him, question Bradley, and eventually approach the Quaker home.When Quirt is aware of Laredo's presence outside the house, he jumps out of bed and dresses and gets his gun but it has no bullets, as Mr. Worth had emptied it. Talking tough, he bluffs, holding the gang off with his unloaded gun. Laredo wants the land Quirt had secured, and Quirt agrees to sell for twenty thousand dollars and signs a deed. Laredo hands over five thousand, promising to give the rest of the money later when Quirt comes over to collect.Quirt is respectful of the Quaker family's ways, he hangs his holstered gun outside, never allowing it inside. Exposure to the ways of the Quakers starts to change not only gunfighter Quirt but also the cynical, atheistic doctor who attends to him, grumbling all the time.When Quirt is able, he helps the family in their farm work, and is very grateful for their loving care.For Penelope, it has been virtually love at first sight. Quirt develops feelings for her as they chat about each other, farm work, and Quaker beliefs.In little time, Quirt kisses her, and she reacts ecstatically.They are interrupted by territorial Marshal Wistful McClintock (Harry Carey) who questions Quirt about his recent whereabouts. Penelope's statement that he hasn't been outside the farm for days is totally believed, but the marshal warns about his habits and promises he will be watching closely.Quirts romantic feelings can't help but increase.At one point Penelope confesses her love for Quirt, and is surprised he doesn't feel the same: ""I never thought it could happen to one and not another."" Her outright innocence is incredibly touching and endearing, and affects Quirt deeply.Quirt doesn't want to let the love take over because of the life that he leads and because he will be out looking for revenge on the people who shot him. The tug of his old ways is still strong.Quirt's reputation as a gunslinger comes in very handy in settling a dispute with a neighbor who has diverted water that used to flow toward the Quaker settlement. Neighbor Frederick Carson (Paul Hurst) is convinced by Quirt by the power of his menacing reputation, to ""be a good neighbor"" and remove the top two boards holding back water that used to flow into flumes and irrigation ditches.Nevertheless it is the genuine and uncritical welcome the old man subsequently receives from the Worths that converts him from obnoxious neighbor into friend. As Carson is happily taking home a basket of pies and donuts from Mrs. Worth, he remarks to the as yet vacillating Quirt, about how good helping his neighbors makes him feel.As Quirt stays with the family longer, their life becomes more attractive to him.On the way to a surprise arranged for him at a [Quaker] meeting, Quirt is seen by the passing Randy McCall (Lee Dixon), who is an old friend and former partner in crime. Randy reverses course and goes along.At the meeting, the Quaker group thanks Quirt publicly for solving the water problem, and is given a Bible. Randy is impressed, then enthralled by the Bible given to Quirt, and takes to reading it out loud at any opportunity.During the gathering, the young and handsome local blacksmith approaches Penelope and his interest in courting and marrying her is obvious. Quirt becomes jealous but isn't ready to take responsibilities.Randy takes Quirt aside after the ceremony and tells him that he knows that Laredo is planning to rustle a large herd as it is driven through a nearby valley the next day.Quirt, overwhelmed by the Quakers' gratitude, and convinced that he isn't good for Penelope, takes the opportunity to get away and try a return to his old life. He takes the blacksmith aside and tells him to quit stalling and marry Penelope, and immediately departs with Randy.The Laredo gang's attempt to rustle the herd is foiled by Quirt and Randy and another friend. First there are galloping horses, guns blazing, falls from horses, and a stampede, as Laredo attacks, but then Quirts gang comes from behind and one by one picks off the rustlers by using long wooden clubs.Next we see Randy and Quirt drinking at a saloon and casino in Red Rock, where Lila (Joan Barton) is entertaining with her singing. Quirt is no longer the old Quirt. He gambles and wins a pile of chips that he gives to Lila as a goodbye present in honor of their old relationship. Then he picks a fight with a group drinking at the bar by rudely pushing them aside and yelling ""More Whiskey!"" to start a massive saloon brawl.He makes it back to the Worth farm and wants to resume with Penelope.McClintock is not convinced of his desire to reform. He remarks ""I'm patient, that's what hangs all you fellas in the end, I'm patient"", although his regard for Quirts reputation is almost respectful: ""You know Quirt, I always figured on usin' a new rope in hangin' you"". McClintock keeps dropping by to see Quirt and to interrogate him, reminding Quirt that he is going to enjoy hanging him and is waiting for a showdown with Laredo so that he can ""... hang the winner"".Later, when he takes Penelope on a buckboard wagon to pick blackberries, Quirt leaves his gun behind in deference to her wishes. The scene where the two pick blackberries is a romantic idyll, which ends abruptly when Laredo and his gang spot them from a distance and menacingly approach in galloping horses.Outnumbered, without a gun, and with Penelope at his side, there is no option but to run, and there follows a thrilling chase of a wagon on a road being pursued by men on horseback. Quirt maneuvers and takes jumps and steep and narrow paths, one man collides with a tree branch, but eventually his wagon runs off a ledge and falls from a great height into a deep narrow river.Quirt manages to swim to hide below the rocks, pulling an unconscious Penelope with him. Laredo looks upon the scene from a height a few moments later, and assumes Quirt has drowned.Later, Quirt walks into the Worth farm carrying the unconscious Penelope in his arms, and the doctor is called. The prognosis is bad, the skeptical doctor takes up his sermonizing as to how dangerous Quirt is to those around him, and how frustrating his profession is, that he works to patch up people who keep on doing dangerous things and being hurt again and again.Quirt, who believes he is losing the great love of his life, wants revenge, and goes into town to face Laredo when he is told Laredo is in the saloon.He enters one end of town, walking alone, the townspeople scatter. Laredo is shocked to be told Quirt is at the other end of town, inviting him to come out. First he sends one of his henchmen to peek out to verify. Then, he decides to take another swig of a whisky bottle, and waits.Meantime, Penelope has recovered consciousness, and, weak as she is, demands to be driven to town in the wagon, lying down.The Worth wagon arrives on the scene. Penelope insists on trying to talk Quirt out of violence. Quirt turns his back to the saloon to talk to her, just as Laredo emerges. In part to protect Penelope who would be in the line of fire, Quirt drops his gun and turns to face Laredo weaponless.It might have been a sad finale, were it not for the vigilant McClintock, who has his rifle pointed at Laredo from a distance, and shoots as he sees Laredo reach for his gun.So the bad guys die by causes that are natural to them, namely bullets, but Quirt doesn't do the shooting.As Quirt departs on his way home with the Worths, the Marshal picks up Quirt's gun and announces he will hang it in his office along with a new rope, in memory of the adversary who never was.

                    At the beginning of the twentieth century, Mrs. Edwin Muir - Lucy - widowed for one year, decides to move out of her controlling in-law's home in London to the English seaside with her adolescent daughter Anna and their long devoted maid Martha. Despite the rental agent trying to dissuade her, Lucy decides to rent Gull Cottage at Whitecliff-by-the-Sea. She learns first hand before she makes the decision the rental agent's hesitance is because the cottage is haunted, supposedly by its now deceased former owner, seaman Captain Daniel Gregg. After she moves in, she does meet the spirit of Captain Gregg face-to-face. Because she refuses to be scared away by his presence, the two come to an understanding, including that he will not make his presence known to Anna. As time progresses, the two develop a friendship and a bond. Despite his statements to her that she needs to live her life including finding another husband, Daniel seems not to approve of any of the men that enter her life, including the most serious, children's author Miles Fairley. Because of his feelings for her, Daniel eventually has to decide if being a part of her life is more a benefit or hindrance to her in carrying on with the living, regardless of perhaps not being able to carry out his initial goal of realizing his vision for Gull Cottage if he leaves.

After the judge restores order, the clerk reads out the verdict to complete the record: the jury finds him ""not guilty.""

                    Sister Clodagh, currently posted at the Convent of the Order of the Servants of Mary in Calcutta, has just been appointed the Sister Superior of the St. Faith convent, making her the youngest sister superior in the order. The appointment is despite the reservations of the Reverend Mother who believes Sister Clodagh not ready for such an assignment, especially because of its isolated location. The convent will be a new one located in the mountainside Palace of Mopu in the Himalayas, and is only possible through the donation by General Todo Rai of Mopu - ""The Old General"" - of the palace, where the Old General's father formerly kept his concubines. On the Old General's directive, the convent is to provide schooling to the children and young women, and general dispensary services to all native residents who live in the valley below the palace. Accompanying Sister Clodagh will be four of the other nuns, each chosen for a specific reason: Sister Briony for her strength, Sister Phillipa who is to tend to the garden for food, Sister Blanche - more commonly referred to as Sister Honey - for her general ability to spread happiness, and troubled Sister Ruth, who the Reverend Mother believes will truly find her faith from the change in locale. The palace comes with an elderly female caretaker, slightly off kilter Angu Ayah, and a holy man who meditates in solitude and silence outside the palace grounds night and day, he who is not to be disturbed. The General also provides a young boy, six year old Joseph Anthony, the General's cook's son, who will live at the convent to provide translation services. But the sisters' primary liaison to the General and the outside world is his agent, native Brit Mr. Dean, which may prove to be problematic in his gender and doing any work around the convent. Sister Clodagh faces early challenges in feeling the need to accept two people to the convent: seventeen year old Kanchi, who is pushing the boundaries of her sexuality; and the Old General's son, the ""Young General"", who wants the same educational opportunities, if not better, than that offered to his female counterparts. Beyond these issues, each of the sisters is challenged by this posting, from the cultural differences, to the isolation, to the general openness of their environment. Sister Clodagh, as the leader, feels that she has no one to turn to in her confusion, her thoughts turning back to her time in Ireland before joining the order and her love for a young man named Con that was partly the reason for her decision to devote her life to God. But it is Sister Ruth whose issues may be the most problematic as she is becoming unhinged in her growing romantic obsession with Mr. Dean, especially as jealousy emerges in she also believing that Sister Clodagh is falling in love with him as well, which may or may not be the case.

                    Sister Clodah is dispatched with four other nuns to establish a new convent far in the Himalayas. It's a difficult journey and their new house is a ramshackle old building on the edge of a cliff that had been abandoned by a religious Brotherhood many years before. They soon establish a school and an infirmary though the local General's agent, Mr. Dean, warns them against treating the deathly ill as they would no doubt be blamed if the patient doesn't recover. The location, the culture and the mountain air all begin to have a strange effect on the Sisters. Sister Clodagh, who is also on her first assignment as Sister Superior, begins to remember a romance she had as a young woman before entering the sisterhood. Another however, becomes obsessed with Mr. Dean, which leads to tragedy.

He seems to be wandering around doing good deeds for others, almost magically appearing at the right place and time. He helps a blind man cross the street and rescues a baby whose carriage is rolling into traffic. When he sees the beautiful but sad Julia (Loretta Young) converse with her old friend Prof. Wutheridge (Monty Woolley), he takes a serious interest in helping her. Feigning an old acquaintance, he gets more information from the professor, who's unsure if they've ever really met, but guardedly tells the gentleman about Julia's troubles. As they part, Wutheridge wonders who the fellow really is.When she arrives home, Julia finds her husband Henry Brougham (David Niven), the Episcopalian bishop of the local diocese, in a heated argument with the chair of the cathedral committee, Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), a wealthy but domineering older woman. Henry has a dream of building a new cathedral, and needs Mrs. Hamilton's financial support. Unfortunately, she demands that the cathedral be built as a monument to her late husband. Later, Henry argues with Julia, and it's obvious that their marriage is strained by his preoccupation with the cathedral. Harried and harassed, Henry is at his wit's end, and retiring to his study he prays for guidance. Turning to leave, he is surprised to find a gentleman has somehow appeared in his study. Telling Henry that his name is Dudley, the gentleman reveals that he's an angel, and he's come in answer to Henry's prayer.Despite Henry's doubts, Dudley quickly charms his way into Henry's life, becoming a favorite of his maid Matilda (Elsa Lanchester), his little daughter Debby (Karolyn Grimes), his secretary, his St Bernard Queenie, and even his wife Julia, all the while preventing Henry from telling anyone what Dudley claims to be. Julia enjoys Dudley's company, delighting in his broad knowledge of the world and his ability to do seemingly everything well. Meanwhile, Henry gets no closer to building his cathedral, and becomes increasingly angry with Dudley for being so intrusive.A confrontation looms, and Henry decides to submit to Mrs. Hamilton's demands in order to speed things along, get his old life back, and get rid of Dudley. His visit to Mrs. Hamilton is fraught with tension before he even sets off because he'd agreed to have lunch with Julia that afternoon and hear the boys' choir rehearse at St. Timothy's, his old church. Dudley offers to see Mrs. Hamilton so Henry can keep his appointment with Julia and the choir, but Henry curtly refuses, so Dudley meets Julia. He takes her to lunch, to the choir practice, and then they go skating. While Dudley brings out the best in the boy sopranos, Henry abases himself. In the movie's funniest scene, he apologizes to Mrs. Hamilton for disagreeing with her and promises the cathedral will be built exactly as she wishes. She adds a new condition: in the stained-glass window depicting St. George and the dragon, St. George must have her late husband's face. ""Who do you see as the dragon?"" asks Henry, and she looks at him a bit suspiciously, but he's all innocence. Having achieved his objective he tries to go, but finds himself stuck to his chair, which prevents him from meeting Julia. Everyone involved &mdash; the bishop, the dowager, and her butler &mdash; is much too dignified to allow the scene to descend into farce, but it takes some doing to avoid it, with Henry creeping around the room in the hunched posture forced upon him by the chair. Eventually he calls home and asks Matilda to bring him another pair of trousers.Later that afternoon, Henry tells Dudley he can leave; Henry's prayer had been answered. Dudley's not so sure. What does Henry really want: the cathedral, or Julia's happiness? Enraged, Henry demands that Dudley get out of his life at once, and as Dudley departs with a smile, he admonishes Henry not to let Julia see him this angry. Later, visiting Professor Wutheridge, Henry confesses that he's probably lost Julia to Dudley, and is surprised to find that he can actually tell the professor about Dudley being an angel. Wutheridge reminds Henry that he has an advantage over an angel: he is a mortal man, and Julia is a mortal woman.During the afternoon on December 24th, Henry gives his secretary Miss Cassaway (Sara Haden) the manuscript of his Christmas Eve sermon to type. She isn't thrilled to be staying late on Christmas Eve, so when Dudley turns up and offers to finish it for her, she's quick to accept. Dudley tosses the manuscript and incomplete typescript into the fire, orders the typewriter ""Take a sermon,"" and starts dictating a sermon about Christmas gifts and an empty stocking.Meanwhile, Henry and Julia have gone to pay some calls, finishing with Mrs. Hamilton. But Dudley is there before them. Left alone to await her in the drawing room, he finds an old musical manuscript dedicated lovingly to Agnes (Mrs. Hamilton's first name is Agnes) and signed ""Allan"" &mdash; not her late husband's name. When she comes in Dudley's playing the composition on her harp. Hearing it again after many years moves her, and she tells Dudley that the composer, Allan, was the only man she ever loved. They were engaged, but he didn't have any money and because she feared poverty, she broke it off. She married Mr. Hamilton because he was fond of her, and he was very rich. Mrs. Hamilton breaks down and cries on Dudley's shoulder. when the Broughams arrive she's uncharacteristically warm, asks them to call her Agnes, and mentions in passing that she's decided to give her money to help the poor.Back at the house, Henry faces Dudley one last time. Henry tells him that Julia means more to him than life itself, and he's willing to fight Dudley no matter what may happen. Relieved that Henry has gotten his priorities straight at last, a beaming Dudley tells Henry that he's leaving, and that Henry's prayer has been answered. Confused, Henry disagrees. ""I prayed for a cathedral,"" he says.""No Henry, you prayed for guidance,"" says Dudley. ""That has been given to you.""Dudley has a final meeting with Julia to let her know that he's unlikely to see her again &mdash; angels aren't assigned to the same post more than once because they're not supposed to form attachments &mdash; but he is tired of constantly moving. She realizes what he's saying and tells him very firmly that he must indeed go away and never come back. When he leaves, Dudley takes with him all memory of his existence. None of the people he's helped remember him at all. As they gather in church for Henry's Christmas Eve sermon, Dudley stands outside, unrecognized. He smiles and walks off into the city.

                    Philip Green is a highly respected writer who is recruited by a national magazine to write a series of articles on anti-Semitism in America. He's not too keen on the series, mostly because he's not sure how to tackle the subject. Then it dawns on him: if he was to pretend to all and sundry that he was Jewish, he could then experience the degree of racism and prejudice that exists and write his story from that perspective. It takes little time for him to experience bigotry. His anger at the way he is treated also affects his relationship with Kathy Lacy, his publisher's niece and the person who suggested the series in the first place.

His editor, John Minify, suggests as his first story a series on antisemitism. He is not enthralled with the topic, which he feels has been covered by all pertinent angles by a multitude of writers, until Tommy asks him about the entire nature of the subject, he who has no idea what it all means and why. Even then, Schuyler is having problems coming up with a suitable angle. But he does come up with what he believes is a new and fresh angle: he will pretend to be Jewish for the period that he is writing the series, he reverting back the more Jewish sounding Phil Green as his name, and as such he will be his own guinea pig. The only people who will know that he is really a gentile is his family, Minify, his wife and who becomes Schuyler's girlfriend, Minify's niece, divorced schoolteacher Kathy Lacy, who came up with the antisemitism story idea to begin with. Through this process, ""Phil"" will encounter much racism, not only against Jews but other minorities, and from unexpected sources. Although he expected open racism, it is the people who stand by and watch it happen without doing anything about it that ends up bothering him the most. He expected the process to affect his own life, which he could handle, but he may not be able to handle how it affects those around him, most specifically his mother, who is facing some health issues, Tommy and Kathy, the latter with whose relationship is also affected. His long time friend, Dave Goldman, who often shortens it to the less Jewish sounding Dave Gold, may be able to give Phil and those around him a better perspective of what is happening.

                    Joseph ""Sammy"" Samuels is found beaten to death in his Washington D.C. apartment by his girlfriend, Miss Lewis. Cpt. Finlay of the police department is the lead investigator into the murder, which seemingly has to do with a group of four military men - most recently decommissioned - that Sammy and Miss Lewis had drinks with earlier that evening in a bar. Those four are ""Monty"" Montgomery, Arthur ""Mitch"" Mitchell, Floyd Bowers, and Floyd's friend Leroy. Indeed, Monty, who is questioned first by Finlay as he wanders by Sammy's apartment during the investigation, confirms that he, Floyd and Mitch were even in Sammy's apartment later having drinks with Sammy, which explains why Finlay found Mitch's wallet in the apartment. On the surface, Mitch seems to be the most likely candidate as the murderer based on Monty's story that Mitch was drunk and out of sorts. A fifth decommissioned military man, Peter Keely - Mitch's roommate - confirms Mitch's tenuous mental state over his uncertain future especially with his wife back in Chicago, but knows sensitive Mitch is not the type of person who could be a murderer. Keely himself tries to find the missing Mitch to get his story and hopefully a confirmable alibi for the time of the murder. Keely and Finlay at times seem to be working on cross purposes, but both come to the realization of the identity of the murderer about the same time. Without hard evidence or a witness, Finlay believes the key to conviction lies with Leroy.

One of them, Mitchell, had left the bar with Samuels and a girl. Another soldier, Montgomery, had seen Mitchell in Samuels' apartment but he ran off with Samuels still alive. Sgt. Peter Keely doesn't believe for one minute that the mild-mannered Mitchell could kill anyone. He finds Mitchell who tells him he'd agreed to go out to dinner with Samuels but wasn't feeling well and left. The next thing he remembers is sitting in a club with a girl named Ginny. Finlay thinks it's a hate crime and that Samuels was killed because he was Jewish. The real killer is prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure he gets away with Samuels' murder.

Charming and good-looking, Stanton spends much of his time casually romancing Zeena (Joan Blondell) the second half of a mentalist act she works with her husband, alcoholic Pete (Ian Keith). Most of Stantons other affections are directed toward Molly (Coleen Gray) whose boyfriend Bruno (Mike Mazurki) jealously tries to interrupt whenever Stanton is nearby. When Stanton learns of a former mind-reading act that Zeena and Pete had before they joined the carnival he approaches them with the idea of reviving it but is rebuffed with the excuse from Zeena that the couple are saving the act to sell as money for their retirement, and also Pete is too drunk to perform it. One night Stanton accidentally gives Pete wood alcohol to drink killing the older man leaving the younger man with a lingering sense of guilt. Needing to find a new act Stanton convinces Zeena to start up the old act and they do so at great success. Stanton and Molly fall in love and are reviled by Bruno and Zeena and kicked out of the Carnival so Stanton takes the mind-reading act on the road with Molly with even greater success than before. Once in the limelight Stanton realizes something that Pete had told him years earlier that the audience wants to be duped because it gives them a sense of hope, and this small truth empowers Stanton to develop his performance skills to even greater heights. With the aid of a beautiful society psychiatrist Dr. Lilith Ritter (Helen Walker) Stanton starts up an act in which he channels the dead relatives of high-class socialites. When one of his scams backfires Stanton finds that his alliances have fled so he sends Molly away to the carnival and he leaves alone, soon becoming a hobo with many other forgotten men and then an anonymous bum, who wanders into a carnival taking the only job offered him, that of a Geek, which he gladly accepts.","

    Synopsis
    Stanton Carlisle (Tyrone Power) raised in an orphanage and reform school is a drifter who works as a barker in a carnival. He is fascinated by the Geek side show in which a crazy man performs by biting heads off of live chickens and is paid off with a bottle of rotgut and a cot to sleep. Charming and good-looking, Stanton spends much of his time casually romancing Zeena (Joan Blondell) the second half of a mentalist act she works with her husband, alcoholic Pete (Ian Keith). Most of Stantons other affections are directed toward Molly (Coleen Gray) whose boyfriend Bruno (Mike Mazurki) jealously tries to interrupt whenever Stanton is nearby. When Stanton learns of a former mind-reading act that Zeena and Pete had before they joined the carnival he approaches them with the idea of reviving it but is rebuffed with the excuse from Zeena that the couple are saving the act to sell as money for their retirement, and also Pete is too drunk to perform it. One night Stanton accidentally gives Pete wood alcohol to drink killing the older man leaving the younger man with a lingering sense of guilt. Needing to find a new act Stanton convinces Zeena to start up the old act and they do so at great success. Stanton and Molly fall in love and are reviled by Bruno and Zeena and kicked out of the Carnival so Stanton takes the mind-reading act on the road with Molly with even greater success than before. Once in the limelight Stanton realizes something that Pete had told him years earlier that the audience wants to be duped because it gives them a sense of hope, and this small truth empowers Stanton to develop his performance skills to even greater heights. With the aid of a beautiful society psychiatrist Dr. Lilith Ritter (Helen Walker) Stanton starts up an act in which he channels the dead relatives of high-class socialites. When one of his scams backfires Stanton finds that his alliances have fled so he sends Molly away to the carnival and he leaves alone, soon becoming a hobo with many other forgotten men and then an anonymous bum, who wanders into a carnival taking the only job offered him, that of a Geek, which he gladly accepts.

                    A woman wanders the streets of Los Angeles in some sort of emotional distress. She is also under some delusion as she approaches many men, strangers who she calls ""David"". Eventually, an ambulance is called, the attendants who take her to the hospital, where she is eventually placed in the psychiatric ward. Placing her under some medication to help her remember, Dr. Harvey Willard, the psychiatrist on duty, is able to get some semblance of a story out of her over the ensuing days. This phase of her life begins just over a year ago when she, single RN Louise Howell, is under the employ of wealthy Dean Graham to take care of his chronically ill and largely bedridden wife, Pauline Graham, at their lake house outside of Washington, DC. Due to her circumstances, Pauline believes that Dean and Louise are carrying on an affair behind her back. Louise can see that Dean does have feelings for her that way in his loneliness. The ""David"" in question is David Sutton, a civil engineer who lives across the lake from the Grahams, he with who Louise had been having a secret relationship. That relationship was always meant to be casual, but David tries to break it off with her when he sees that she has fallen in love with him to an obsessional state. Louise begins to manipulate the situation to be in David's life, even if only peripherally. Louise also begins to feel that if she can't have David, nobody else should. Louise is eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia during this time - something she does not mention to anyone in her life - which places her story to Dr. Willard in some context, including what of the story is real and what is all part of her delusion.

It is not concerned with the struggle between the law and an illegal organisation, but only with the conflict in the hearts of the people when they become unexpectedly involved.""The city and the organisation are never explicitly named, but the protagonist, Johnny McQueen (James Mason), is the IRA-like group's leader in the city (presumably Belfast). Johnny has been hiding the past six months since his escape from prison in a house occupied by Kathleen Sullivan (Kathleen Ryan) - who loves him - and her grandmother.Johnny has been ordered to rob a mill to obtain funds for his nationalist IRA group. His men, however, are a bit uneasy about his fitness for the task, having noticed a change in him since his escape; he has expressed his new belief that negotiation might achieve their goals more effectively than violence. Dennis (Robert Beatty) offers to take his place, but Johnny turns him down.The next day, Johnny, Nolan (Dan O'Herlihy) and Murphy break into the mill office and hold the clerks at gunpoint to demand the money. As they leave with the money, Johnny is confronted by an armed cashier. Johnny is shot in his upper left arm before he returns fire and kills the cashier. The getaway driver, Pat (Cyril Cusack), drives off at high speed before Johnny is fully inside the getaway car. Johnny falls off. While his confederates argue about what to do, Johnny gets up and dashes away.Upon arrival back at Kathleen's house, Dennis orders the others to report to their headquarters. Along the way that evening, however, the trio arouse the suspicion of the local police, out in force on a manhunt for the robbers. They are pursued, but get away. Pat and Nolan stop off at Theresa O'Brien's place; Murphy does not trust her and goes elsewhere. She betrays the pair to the authorities. As they leave, they are both gunned down after they start shooting.Dennis finds Johnny wounded in the street, but the police show up nearby. Dennis is captured after drawing them away.Now alone, Johnny makes his way toward Kathleen's place, but collapses in the street. Passersby Maureen and Maudie take him home, thinking he has been struck by a passing lorry. When they discover who he is, Johnny departs before they can call the police and gets into a parked hansom taxicab. ""Gin"" Jimmy (Joseph Tomelty), the cabdriver, comes out and starts looking for a fare, unaware he has a wanted man for a passenger. When he finds out, he drops Johnny off as quickly as he can before driving away.Shell (F. J. McCormick), a local Unionist, spots Gin dumping the now nearly unconscious fugitive. A poor man, Shell goes to Catholic priest Father Tom (W. G. Fay), hoping for a financial reward. By chance, Kathleen arrives shortly afterward, looking for help. Father Tom persuades Shell to fetch Johnny. Shell, while dropping off his pet bird at home, has to fend off another resident, (the possibly mentally unstable) painter Lukey (Robert Newton), who wants him to pose some more for him.Meanwhile, Johnny revives and stumbles into a private booth in a crowded bar. Proprietor Fencie (William Hartnell) recognises him; wanting no trouble, he closes his establishment a bit early. He then recruits Shell and the persistent Lukey, who have separately converged on the bar, to take Johnny away in a cab. Over Shell's protests, Lukey takes Johnny back to his studio to paint his portrait. Failed medical student Tober (Elwyn Brook-Jones) tends to Johnny's wound as best he can. Johnny hallucinates, thinking Father Tom is talking to him. Johnny then speaks aloud (drooling crazily throughout) parts of 1 Corinthians 13, first verse 13 (""When I was a child ...""), then 1-2 (""Though I speak ... and have not charity, I am nothing."").When a sympathetic Catholic police inspector (Denis O'Dea), who had earlier led a search of Kathleen's home and warned her against getting involved with the IRA, shows up to try to get information from Father Tom, Kathleen slips away. She arranges passage on a ship for Johnny to take him out of the country and goes searching for him. Shell starts Johnny toward Father Tom's, then goes ahead and encounters Kathleen. She takes Johnny to the ship, but finds the police closing in. Nearly incoherent from blood loss due to his bullet wound, Johnny is too far gone to see them. When he asks, ""Is it far?"", Kathleen replies, ""It's a long way, Johnny, but I'm coming with you."" She then draws a gun and starts firing, forcing the policemen to shoot back, killing them both.","

It is not concerned with the struggle between the law and an illegal organisation, but only with the conflict in the hearts of the people when they become unexpectedly involved.""The city and the organisation are never explicitly named, but the protagonist, Johnny McQueen (James Mason), is the IRA-like group's leader in the city (presumably Belfast). Johnny has been hiding the past six months since his escape from prison in a house occupied by Kathleen Sullivan (Kathleen Ryan) - who loves him - and her grandmother.Johnny has been ordered to rob a mill to obtain funds for his nationalist IRA group. His men, however, are a bit uneasy about his fitness for the task, having noticed a change in him since his escape; he has expressed his new belief that negotiation might achieve their goals more effectively than violence. Dennis (Robert Beatty) offers to take his place, but Johnny turns him down.The next day, Johnny, Nolan (Dan O'Herlihy) and Murphy break into the mill office and hold the clerks at gunpoint to demand the money. As they leave with the money, Johnny is confronted by an armed cashier. Johnny is shot in his upper left arm before he returns fire and kills the cashier. The getaway driver, Pat (Cyril Cusack), drives off at high speed before Johnny is fully inside the getaway car. Johnny falls off. While his confederates argue about what to do, Johnny gets up and dashes away.Upon arrival back at Kathleen's house, Dennis orders the others to report to their headquarters. Along the way that evening, however, the trio arouse the suspicion of the local police, out in force on a manhunt for the robbers. They are pursued, but get away. Pat and Nolan stop off at Theresa O'Brien's place; Murphy does not trust her and goes elsewhere. She betrays the pair to the authorities. As they leave, they are both gunned down after they start shooting.Dennis finds Johnny wounded in the street, but the police show up nearby. Dennis is captured after drawing them away.Now alone, Johnny makes his way toward Kathleen's place, but collapses in the street. Passersby Maureen and Maudie take him home, thinking he has been struck by a passing lorry. When they discover who he is, Johnny departs before they can call the police and gets into a parked hansom taxicab. ""Gin"" Jimmy (Joseph Tomelty), the cabdriver, comes out and starts looking for a fare, unaware he has a wanted man for a passenger. When he finds out, he drops Johnny off as quickly as he can before driving away.Shell (F. J. McCormick), a local Unionist, spots Gin dumping the now nearly unconscious fugitive. A poor man, Shell goes to Catholic priest Father Tom (W. G. Fay), hoping for a financial reward. By chance, Kathleen arrives shortly afterward, looking for help. Father Tom persuades Shell to fetch Johnny. Shell, while dropping off his pet bird at home, has to fend off another resident, (the possibly mentally unstable) painter Lukey (Robert Newton), who wants him to pose some more for him.Meanwhile, Johnny revives and stumbles into a private booth in a crowded bar. Proprietor Fencie (William Hartnell) recognises him; wanting no trouble, he closes his establishment a bit early. He then recruits Shell and the persistent Lukey, who have separately converged on the bar, to take Johnny away in a cab. Over Shell's protests, Lukey takes Johnny back to his studio to paint his portrait. Failed medical student Tober (Elwyn Brook-Jones) tends to Johnny's wound as best he can. Johnny hallucinates, thinking Father Tom is talking to him. Johnny then speaks aloud (drooling crazily throughout) parts of 1 Corinthians 13, first verse 13 (""When I was a child ...""), then 1-2 (""Though I speak ... and have not charity, I am nothing."").When a sympathetic Catholic police inspector (Denis O'Dea), who had earlier led a search of Kathleen's home and warned her against getting involved with the IRA, shows up to try to get information from Father Tom, Kathleen slips away. She arranges passage on a ship for Johnny to take him out of the country and goes searching for him. Shell starts Johnny toward Father Tom's, then goes ahead and encounters Kathleen. She takes Johnny to the ship, but finds the police closing in. Nearly incoherent from blood loss due to his bullet wound, Johnny is too far gone to see them. When he asks, ""Is it far?"", Kathleen replies, ""It's a long way, Johnny, but I'm coming with you."" She then draws a gun and starts firing, forcing the policemen to shoot back, killing them both.

They are known as ""the mysterious Morgans"" because of their adopted daughter Meg. No one knows who her parents were or how Pete and Ellen came to adopt her when she was a toddler. Now eighteen, Meg suggests that Pete hire a classmate of hers, Nath Storm, to work on the farm after school. Nath's widowed mother operates a general store in town but business is not good. Pete is reluctant to take on a farmhand because he doesn't want outsiders around, but Meg talks him into it. To her delight, Nath is allowed to start at once.During dinner, Pete and Ellen are somewhat taken aback to hear Nath refer to them as ""the mysterious Morgans."" Ellen explains that they are so self-sufficient on the farm that they rarely go into town. As for Meg, her parents left her in the Morgans' care while they took a trip. They were killed in an accident and as there were no other relatives, Pete and Ellen adopted her.Since it is late, the Morgans urge Nath to spend the night in the hired hand's cabin. When he insists on going home, Pete orders him not to go through Oxhead woods. The woods are dangerous and hard to navigate after dark. Nath protests that going the other way will take much longer.

They arrange to meet at a later date so she can give him the bond.Pete sometimes calls Meg ""Jeannie"" and mentions an abandoned dwelling in the woods called the Red House.

Mrs. Storm says that Pete fell into a quarry many years earlier and the local physician, Dr. Byrne, amputated the leg on the Morgan's kitchen table.Tibby and Teller secretly meet and she gives him the bond. Although she is slightly afraid of him, that doesn't stop her from responding to his advances.It turns out that Pete has hired Teller to keep people out of the woods.

In a fury, he throws a lamp at Ellen and injures her arm. Meg hears the commotion and calls out to Ellen. Hiding her injury, Ellen assures Meg that nothing is wrong.Matters come to a head when Meg confides in Ellen that Pete watches her in a way that makes her uncomfortable. Ellen asks if he has ever forced himself on her. He has not, but Ellen decides to burn down the Red House. Only then will Pete be at peace. Meg wants to go with her but cannot walk so far due to her leg. She hides in the hired hand's cabin while Ellen, armed with a jug of gasoline, sets off for the Red House.Teller doesn't recognize Ellen in the darkness and fires off several shots. Ellen is hit and collapses. When Teller realizes what he has done, he runs away. Meg finds Ellen seriously injured and renders what first aid she can.

Pete locks the door, frightening Meg, but he assures her he is going to protect her this time. He lights a candle and Meg sees her baby bed still standing. Pete tells her the entire story. He and Jeannie were having an affair. When Jeannie broke it off, he went to the Red House to persuade her to change her mind. Meg's father drove up in a surrey. To keep Jeannie quiet, Pete put his hand over her mouth and nose, accidentally smothering her. He also killed Meg's father. Putting the bodies into the surrey, he drove it into the icehouse. The spring had broken through the floor and the surrey sank. In a fit of remorse, Pete tried to commit suicide by jumping into the quarry.Meg hears Nath and the sheriff outside and calls for help. Pete nearly smothers her in the same way he did Jeannie. When Nath and the sheriff burst into the house, Pete runs outside and climbs into his truck. Turning it around, he heads for the icehouse. He drives through the door and the truck sinks. As it goes down, a wheel from the surrey floats to the top.The movie ends with Nath finishing what Ellen started. As the Red House goes up in smoke, Meg and Nath watch.","

                    Amber St. Clair is 16-years-old by the time the revolution of Oliver Cromwell is ended and the House of Stuart has returned to the British throne in 1660, and she is none too happy in the home of her Puritanical foster parents, and soon departs for London under the reluctant ""patronage"" of Bruce Carlton. Amber encounters a lot of patrons as she climbs to the top lying on her back. Carlton goes off on some privateering business in the Colonies and Amber is swindled out of the money he left her. She goes to prison, has Carlton's child there (which he doesn't know about until years later), and escapes prison with the aid of highwayman Black Jack Mallard, who soon has her working as a decoy and other odd jobs, using her non-monetary assets, for his gang. She is caught and arrested by Captain Rex Morgan who, for considerations duly delivered, places her in the theatre, where she enjoys the King's protection. There, while pounding the boards, she first attracts the attention of King Charles II and also the Earl of Radcliffe. She marries the Earl and hits her peak when she becomes the King's ""favorite.""

                    1923. Based on one specific game winning incident on the college football field, somewhat feckless Harold Diddlebock is offered a job by E.J. Waggleberry at his advertising firm after Harold graduates from college. Harold believes this offer will set him up for life. After Harold graduates, Waggleberry does offer him that job, an entry level accounting one from which Harold believes he will quickly climb the corporate ladder. Fast forward twenty-two years to 1945: Harold is still in that entry level job. Waggleberry fires him due to his ineptitude. Harold is not as much disappointed in his professional career, or lack of one, than he is in no longer seeing on a day-to-day basis Miss Otis, a graphic artist at Waggleberry's with who he is in love. Each of Miss Otis' six sisters had her job before her, and Harold loved each of them when they had the job, something all seven sisters knew and know. Harold was never financially able to ask any sister to marry him at the time. Harold leaves Waggleberry's with among other things close to $3,000 he has amassed in the company's savings. Seeing his roll of money, a down on his luck gambler named Wormy is able to convince teetotalling Harold to have his first ever drink to drown whatever ails his soul. Several days later, Harold awakens from his hangover in his bed in the home of his sister Flora, having only vague recollections of what happened since he was fired. His own suit is missing - he wearing an outlandish suit its origin he doesn't know - as is the $3,000. He slowly is able to piece together some of the events of the past few days, he now needing to deal with the aftermath of his gambling and spending spree, one purchase in particular even more outlandish than the suit and it an ""asset"" he might have a difficult time liquidating, that is unless he was really paying attention to all those advertising ideas in his twenty-two years at Waggleberry's...

Although he was beloved by most, he did have his detractors for not absolving those he deemed to have done bad deeds. The shooting is witnessed by many, although the murderer's face is unseen. Weeks go by with no progress on finding the killer, the police and city officials under much pressure to make progress. Based on circumstantial evidence including seven witnesses identifying him and the bullet used in the murder coming from his gun, drifter and WWII veteran John Waldron is charged with murder. State's Attorney Henry Harvey is initially as anxious as anyone to see Waldron charged. However as the case goes to preliminary state hearing, Harvey proceeds to prove Waldron innocent. Some see his move as purely a political one as prosecuting a loyal war veteran is not seen as a popular move for potential gubernatorial candidate Harvey. With the hullabaloo swirling around him, Harvey strives to discover the truth behind the charges against Waldron, despite pressure from some to prosecute Waldron for murder regardless of his guilt or innocence.

                    Nick and Nora Charles are asked by Phil Brant and Janet Thayar, who have just eloped, to help them after band leader Tommy Drake is killed at a society dance which Nick and Nora also attended. The police are looking to arrest Brant for the murder and while he claims he's innocent, Nick isn't too keen on having him in the house and turns him over to the police. As they look into the case, Nick and Nora learn that Drake wasn't very well liked and there are actually several people who benefited from his death. Drake owed money to loan shark Al Amboy, and Janet's father disliked Brant and may have set him up. Drake's girlfriend may have been having a fling with clarinetist Buddy Hollis, and he and Drake had a fist fight on stage during the festivities. Nick arranges for another party on the same boat where Nora notices something quite peculiar about one of the guest's jewelry.

                    Private investigator Phillip Marlowe recounts one of his recent cases, which he has named The Lady in the Lake. Just prior to Christmas, he is secretly hired by Adrienne Fromsett, the tough talking second in command at Kingsby Publishing, to find Chrystal Kingsby, the wife of her boss Derace Kingsby. Chrystal has been missing for two months, and Derace, who believes for her own reasons has run off, just wants her to be left alone. But Adrienne knows that Chrystal has a boyfriend named Chris Lavery, the supposed reason for her running off. Marlowe believes Adrienne has ulterior motives for wanting Chrystal found, beyond her want to get Chrystal out of the way so that she can become Mrs. Derace Kingsby herself. Those ulterior motives may have something to do with the fact that everywhere Adrienne points him, people are either unhappy to see him, or he finds other people murdered. One of those murdered is a woman found in a lake near where the Kingsbys own a cabin. But what Marlowe learns is that to find Chrystal and discover the reasons for the additional murders, he has to dig through a complex web, which also includes the involvement of the police.

"61","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039288/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","A limousine drives up a sinuous road to a mansion while a young woman on horseback races it and cuts across its path several times. The limousine pulls up to the mansion and a staff member greets the Senator who escorts a woman into the house. She thanks him for giving her a ride from the station. As she sits in the large foyer, she turns to face the camera for the first time, giving us the first look at Sandra Marshall (Barbara Stanwyck). Meanwhile, Senator Caldwell (Jerome Cowan) exits into another room. After a bit he returns to tell Sandra that his brother will see her now. Sandra goes into the adjacent room where Mark Caldwell (Errol Flynn) sits behind a desk. He reminds Sandra that the family is in mourning over the death of his nephew, so he assumes her reason for visiting must be urgent. Sandra reveals that she is the widow of the nephew. She shows a copy of a marriage license and tells Mark that she met his nephew in school where she was finishing a degree. She agreed to marry Jim because he couldn't get his hands on his inheritances until he turned 30 unless he married earlier. She says their arrangement was for him to give her $2,000 to complete her studies with the understanding that she would divorce him after 6 months. Mark notes that conveniently only 5 months have gone by and the $2,000 has become 2 million. Sandra shows him a copy of Jim's will, saying she intends to claim the rights left her in his will. Mark insists Jim left no will but Sandra produces an unsigned copy. Mark dismisses it. Sandra insists there's an original properly attested and insists if Mark doesn't find it, she'll insist on her entire rights. Mark will let Sandra stay the night but wants her to leave in the morning. She asks to see her husband's body but the casket is closed. While paying her last respects, she hears the sounds of the Senator and Mark arguing.At dinner, Sandra meets Julie Demarest, Jim's sister (and the horsewoman from the opening sequence). Julie is furious with Mark for opening her mail. Julie is immediately taken with Sandra and wants her to stay. Sandra says she has a suitcase at the station and the Senator volunteers that the servant, Becket, can bring it up in the morning, so it's arranged that Sandra will stay. Julie insists Mark will not succeed in breaking off her romance.Later, the maid, Marta (Helene Thimig), says goodnight to Julie and closes her door, but Julie sneaks out of her room and goes to Sandra's room where she accuses Mark of using Jim's money to fund his laboratory. She tells Sandra that Jim was in love with another woman, Amy Daniels, but she suspects Mark of causing the breakup of that relationship. One day Jim and his girlfriend were all romance and the next it was over. Sandra asks the cause of Jim's death, and Julie says it was pneumonia, that she heard Jim's voice after he came back from a trip to Canada, but then the next day he had been moved to the laboratory where she was never allowed to go, and Mark told her that Jim had fallen ill. She never saw him again. Leaving Sandra's room, Julie looks over the railing to see Mark pacing in the foyer below. When he looks up she quickly steals away into her room while he looks up suspiciously.The next day, everyone returns from Jim's funeral. A moment alone, the Senator insists to Mark that he's done what he agreed to do: he's put in an appearance at the funeral, but now he needs to go. Mark wants him to stay till the question of Jim's will is settled, but the Senator insists on leaving, hoping Mark won't regret what he's doing. Rejoining Sandra and Julie and others, he asks his lawyer, Davenport, how long it'll take to locate Jim's safe deposit box. About 2 weeks he's told. Sandra is given Jim's death certificate, signed by the local doctor and undertaker.Julie arranges to go riding with Sandra, but once out, admits she's meeting her boyfriend, Ronnie Manning. Sandra leaves them alone but quickly comes across Mark who knows what's going on and reproves Sandra for abetting Julie. Julie rides up and angrily strikes Mark with her riding crop for spying on her. He takes the crop and breaks it, then insists Julie get off her horse so he can talk to her.Returning to the stables, Sandra notes the rear extension of the house and asks the groom if they use it. He tells her, Oh, yes, that's Mr. Mark's laboratory. Looking at the wing, Sandra sees a bearded man close one of the windows. Turning she sees Julie ride up angrily, dismount and stride towards the house.That night as Sandra lies in bed awake, Julie rushes in and insists Sandra must've heard it, too: a sound of scuffling and a man's voice, crying out in agony. She says it sounds like Jim's voice. Sandra starts to assure her it's not possible when a man's voice is heard, crying out in agony. Taking Julie's hand, Sandra leads her along the corridor, asking her where the entrance to the laboratory wing is. Julie points it out, up a short flight of stairs but says it's always kept locked. Sandra is convinced that's where the cry came from. They move towards the door when they hear someone approaching from the other side. They flee down the corridor. The laboratory door is opening throwing a light against the wall with a man's shadow. Sandra puts Julie to bed, telling her to pretend she's asleep and hides in Julie's closet. Mark opens the door and looks in on the apparently sleeping Julie while Sandra watches. Once Mark leaves, Sandra promises Julie she'll find out what's going on. She tells Julie to tell Mark what she heard but not that she left her room and not that Sandra was with her.The next morning Mark reads in the paper that Senator Caldwell's Investigation Hits Snag with the subheading Certain Factions Oppose Appointment. When Sandra joins him, he points out the problems the Senator is having. She notes the Senator's appointment would make him famous, not that Mark's scientific achievements aren't already well known. Julie joins them and tells about hearing scuffling and cries again. Mark insists it's nightmares and that she's had nightmares about his laboratory since she was a child when he used to take her in there but had to stop and keep it locked when she started sneaking in by herself. Once he leaves the table, Sandra agrees Mark is lying, and looks for a time when she can explore. Julie says Marta takes an afternoon nap when Becket watches Julie but that he has many things to do.At Sandra's request, Julie shows her Jim's room. Sandra sees a happy photo of Mark with Jim in an album. She notes that Julie and Jim's mother must have been very devoted to Mark, but Julie says Mark and her mother made up her mother's will when she was only 3 and Jim was away at school. They discover that all of Jim's pipes are gone and his sports clothes for riding and tennis. Julie surmises that Sandra believes Jim is in the laboratory and starts to get hysterical, thinking she'll be the one going there next. Marta interrupts to say Mark wants to see Sandra in the library.Sandra takes Julie back to her room where Julie says she's less afraid when the doors are closed and eyes aren't looking at her, that sometimes she feels like a black cloud is following her. Sandra encourages her to face her fears, saying she was fearful in Jim's room when she thought he might be still alive but she was wrong to convey those fears to Julie.In the library Mark is upset that Sandra has been in Jim's room and has gotten Julie upset. He insists he's only letting Sandra stay because Julie's so fond of her. He pours her a liqueur while telling her his grandfather fell in love with a dancer but it ended badly: she died two months after they were married... when he poisoned her. Sandra chokes on the liqueur which Mark describes as an old family recipe used for special occasions and called Lacrime Sangue which Sandra translates from the Italian as Tears of Blood. Mark toasts Jim's will. Then, he comes on to her, complimenting her steady eyes and strong chin. She asks if he's looking for her to compliment him back, but he doubts she can overcome the first impression she had of him. She admits he's getting to her. He kisses her. She asks why he did that. He said the scientist took over; he wanted to confirm his first impression of her, and when he says it was confirmed, she slaps him and leaves.Back in her room, a new maid says Julie asked to borrow her face cream, and Sandra gives it to her to take to Julie.Marta closes and locks Julie's door as Julie begs her not to. Marta says she's only doing as she'd told. When Sandra arrives and is about to knock, Marta tells her that Julie is asleep, keeping Sandra from finding out that Julie is locked in.Back in her room, Sandra learns from the new maid that Mark gets dinner by dumbwaiter at exactly midnight and always leaves the laboratory no later than 2 am. She sets her alarm-clock for 3 am. Waking, she removes the tray from the dumbwaiter, climbs in, and hauls herself up to the laboratory. Once inside, there's a second room beyond a closed door and the light is on. She hears Mark ask someone named Laidell (we see it's a bearded man) if everything is all right at Three Hills. Laidell is concerned about filling prescriptions; Mark tells him to fill it in another town if necessary and not to worry about the local doctor, Mark will handle him. Mark comes into the room Sandra's in. She hides behind the door, but he notices the dumbwaiter is not where he left it and finds something in it. Glancing at the door behind which Sandra is hiding, he never-the-less leaves. Sandra returns via the dumbwaiter and is back in her room by 3:30.At 4 a woman screams. Sandra sees Mark running in the courtyard outside her window. Inside, Becket is seen hurrying along the upstairs pulling on his bathrobe. Sandra goes to Julie's room and finds Marta there but not Julie. She goes to the open French doors leading to the window terrace. Mark arrives and tells her not to look but she does and sees Julie sprawled on the courtyard, dead, with her suitcase nearby. Down below, the doctor arrives. Mark insists it was an accident when Julie tried to run away, but Sandra sees her cold cream and insists if Julie were running away, she never would have taken Sandra's cold cream (in a jar established earlier that belonged to Sandra's mother). Sandra insists that it's obvious that Julie didn't pack her bag; someone else packed it for her under orders, clearly thinking Marta did per Mark's orders.Sandra tries the door to the laboratory but finds it locked. She climbs the stairs to the attic and looks out one window seeing a vista, causing her to murmur, Three hills. The next window suits her purpose and she climbs out onto the roof, making her way to a skylight which allows her to drop down into the same room in the laboratory she was in before. She moves to the door, opens it and finds herself face-to-face with Mark who wants to know what she's up to. She insists she thinks that Jim is alive. Mark accuses her of frightening Julie and causing her to try to flee and therefore die. He tells her she'd better go and gives her a comb that fell out of her hair that he found in the dumbwaiter, letting her know he knew she'd used the dumbwaiter before.Sandra, Mark, Marta, and Becket attend the interment of Julie. Back in the house, the furniture is covered with sheets as the staff closes it up. Mark shows Sandra some jewels that belong to his mother and other relatives, jewels that were to be Julie's when she grew up. He tells Sandra to take whatever she'd like much to Sandra's surprise. Mark tells her that Jim's safe deposit box has been found and opened and the will was there. He apologizes for the way he's treated her. Then he tells her he wants to show her something and leads her up the stairs to his lab. When she gets there the lab is empty. Out of the window she sees the same three hills. She asks Mark about Laidell and is told he's a kind of gamekeeper. She asks what'll happen to the horses. Mark says they'll be sold. Sandra asks to go for a ride. He agrees and will call the groom. She leaves and he calls the groom and tells him to give her Colonel.The groom gives her Colonel and tells her that the estate extends in one direction to the three hills, but he warns her not to ride in that direction because the Three Hillls is an abandoned game preserve. She takes Colonel and heads for the Three Hills, getting close enough to see smoke from a fire. A rabbit startles the horse who bolts, eventually throwing her and then running off. She finds she's close to the fence surrounding the game preserve, climbs over and is moving through the woods, hearing ominous rustling when someone calls to Jim. Jim (Richard Basehart) answers and walks right by her. She calls to him. He doesn't seem to know who she is at first and says the Laidells have been taking care of him since the accident. Sandra tells him about Julie and warns him about Mark. They arrange to meet at the house later that night.Returning to the house, Mark tells Sandra they've been searching for her since Colonel came back without her. He tells her it's too late to catch the train; she'll have to drive with him. She says she'd like to stay the night in the house. Mark notes there's no one there, but she doesn't mind. He insists on staying, too, and she can't dissuade him. Mark wants to tell her something, but she evades. He goes off and hears a scraping sound. Returning, he finds she's opened a window and has fled. Outside, Sandra sees a man and calls out Jim! only to run into Mark. She admits she's waiting for Jim and knows he's alive. Mark tells her the truth: Julie and Jim's father went insane and he's been watching them for signs of insanity, too. Jim had an accident in Canada, got into an argument with a gas attendant and killed the man with an iron. Jim and his brother managed to keep the killing out of the U.S. papers, but the court gave him custody of Jim only if he kept him under lock and key. He kept him in his laboratory until the Three Hills site was ready. Jim arrives and sneaks up on Mark, clubbing him unconscious with a wrench. He then accuses Sandra of being in love with Mark and she realizes Mark was telling the truth: Jim is insane. She flees into the house, but Jim catches her. Mark, recovered, enters with Laidell who sneaks up to the second floor landing where Jim is with Sandra. Grabbing Jim, Laidell grapples with him and in the struggle, Jim goes over the railing and falls to his death into the foyer below. Sandra goes out onto the terrace away from the awful sight. Mark joins her there and they apologize for not trusting each other. They walk off hand-in-hand.","

    Synopsis
    A limousine drives up a sinuous road to a mansion while a young woman on horseback races it and cuts across its path several times. The limousine pulls up to the mansion and a staff member greets the Senator who escorts a woman into the house. She thanks him for giving her a ride from the station. As she sits in the large foyer, she turns to face the camera for the first time, giving us the first look at Sandra Marshall (Barbara Stanwyck). Meanwhile, Senator Caldwell (Jerome Cowan) exits into another room. After a bit he returns to tell Sandra that his brother will see her now. Sandra goes into the adjacent room where Mark Caldwell (Errol Flynn) sits behind a desk. He reminds Sandra that the family is in mourning over the death of his nephew, so he assumes her reason for visiting must be urgent. Sandra reveals that she is the widow of the nephew. She shows a copy of a marriage license and tells Mark that she met his nephew in school where she was finishing a degree. She agreed to marry Jim because he couldn't get his hands on his inheritances until he turned 30 unless he married earlier. She says their arrangement was for him to give her $2,000 to complete her studies with the understanding that she would divorce him after 6 months. Mark notes that conveniently only 5 months have gone by and the $2,000 has become 2 million. Sandra shows him a copy of Jim's will, saying she intends to claim the rights left her in his will. Mark insists Jim left no will but Sandra produces an unsigned copy. Mark dismisses it. Sandra insists there's an original properly attested and insists if Mark doesn't find it, she'll insist on her entire rights. Mark will let Sandra stay the night but wants her to leave in the morning. She asks to see her husband's body but the casket is closed. While paying her last respects, she hears the sounds of the Senator and Mark arguing.At dinner, Sandra meets Julie Demarest, Jim's sister (and the horsewoman from the opening sequence). Julie is furious with Mark for opening her mail. Julie is immediately taken with Sandra and wants her to stay. Sandra says she has a suitcase at the station and the Senator volunteers that the servant, Becket, can bring it up in the morning, so it's arranged that Sandra will stay. Julie insists Mark will not succeed in breaking off her romance.Later, the maid, Marta (Helene Thimig), says goodnight to Julie and closes her door, but Julie sneaks out of her room and goes to Sandra's room where she accuses Mark of using Jim's money to fund his laboratory. She tells Sandra that Jim was in love with another woman, Amy Daniels, but she suspects Mark of causing the breakup of that relationship. One day Jim and his girlfriend were all romance and the next it was over. Sandra asks the cause of Jim's death, and Julie says it was pneumonia, that she heard Jim's voice after he came back from a trip to Canada, but then the next day he had been moved to the laboratory where she was never allowed to go, and Mark told her that Jim had fallen ill. She never saw him again. Leaving Sandra's room, Julie looks over the railing to see Mark pacing in the foyer below. When he looks up she quickly steals away into her room while he looks up suspiciously.The next day, everyone returns from Jim's funeral. A moment alone, the Senator insists to Mark that he's done what he agreed to do: he's put in an appearance at the funeral, but now he needs to go. Mark wants him to stay till the question of Jim's will is settled, but the Senator insists on leaving, hoping Mark won't regret what he's doing. Rejoining Sandra and Julie and others, he asks his lawyer, Davenport, how long it'll take to locate Jim's safe deposit box. About 2 weeks he's told. Sandra is given Jim's death certificate, signed by the local doctor and undertaker.Julie arranges to go riding with Sandra, but once out, admits she's meeting her boyfriend, Ronnie Manning. Sandra leaves them alone but quickly comes across Mark who knows what's going on and reproves Sandra for abetting Julie. Julie rides up and angrily strikes Mark with her riding crop for spying on her. He takes the crop and breaks it, then insists Julie get off her horse so he can talk to her.Returning to the stables, Sandra notes the rear extension of the house and asks the groom if they use it. He tells her, Oh, yes, that's Mr. Mark's laboratory. Looking at the wing, Sandra sees a bearded man close one of the windows. Turning she sees Julie ride up angrily, dismount and stride towards the house.That night as Sandra lies in bed awake, Julie rushes in and insists Sandra must've heard it, too: a sound of scuffling and a man's voice, crying out in agony. She says it sounds like Jim's voice. Sandra starts to assure her it's not possible when a man's voice is heard, crying out in agony. Taking Julie's hand, Sandra leads her along the corridor, asking her where the entrance to the laboratory wing is. Julie points it out, up a short flight of stairs but says it's always kept locked. Sandra is convinced that's where the cry came from. They move towards the door when they hear someone approaching from the other side. They flee down the corridor. The laboratory door is opening throwing a light against the wall with a man's shadow. Sandra puts Julie to bed, telling her to pretend she's asleep and hides in Julie's closet. Mark opens the door and looks in on the apparently sleeping Julie while Sandra watches. Once Mark leaves, Sandra promises Julie she'll find out what's going on. She tells Julie to tell Mark what she heard but not that she left her room and not that Sandra was with her.The next morning Mark reads in the paper that Senator Caldwell's Investigation Hits Snag with the subheading Certain Factions Oppose Appointment. When Sandra joins him, he points out the problems the Senator is having. She notes the Senator's appointment would make him famous, not that Mark's scientific achievements aren't already well known. Julie joins them and tells about hearing scuffling and cries again. Mark insists it's nightmares and that she's had nightmares about his laboratory since she was a child when he used to take her in there but had to stop and keep it locked when she started sneaking in by herself. Once he leaves the table, Sandra agrees Mark is lying, and looks for a time when she can explore. Julie says Marta takes an afternoon nap when Becket watches Julie but that he has many things to do.At Sandra's request, Julie shows her Jim's room. Sandra sees a happy photo of Mark with Jim in an album. She notes that Julie and Jim's mother must have been very devoted to Mark, but Julie says Mark and her mother made up her mother's will when she was only 3 and Jim was away at school. They discover that all of Jim's pipes are gone and his sports clothes for riding and tennis. Julie surmises that Sandra believes Jim is in the laboratory and starts to get hysterical, thinking she'll be the one going there next. Marta interrupts to say Mark wants to see Sandra in the library.Sandra takes Julie back to her room where Julie says she's less afraid when the doors are closed and eyes aren't looking at her, that sometimes she feels like a black cloud is following her. Sandra encourages her to face her fears, saying she was fearful in Jim's room when she thought he might be still alive but she was wrong to convey those fears to Julie.In the library Mark is upset that Sandra has been in Jim's room and has gotten Julie upset. He insists he's only letting Sandra stay because Julie's so fond of her. He pours her a liqueur while telling her his grandfather fell in love with a dancer but it ended badly: she died two months after they were married... when he poisoned her. Sandra chokes on the liqueur which Mark describes as an old family recipe used for special occasions and called Lacrime Sangue which Sandra translates from the Italian as Tears of Blood. Mark toasts Jim's will. Then, he comes on to her, complimenting her steady eyes and strong chin. She asks if he's looking for her to compliment him back, but he doubts she can overcome the first impression she had of him. She admits he's getting to her. He kisses her. She asks why he did that. He said the scientist took over; he wanted to confirm his first impression of her, and when he says it was confirmed, she slaps him and leaves.Back in her room, a new maid says Julie asked to borrow her face cream, and Sandra gives it to her to take to Julie.Marta closes and locks Julie's door as Julie begs her not to. Marta says she's only doing as she'd told. When Sandra arrives and is about to knock, Marta tells her that Julie is asleep, keeping Sandra from finding out that Julie is locked in.Back in her room, Sandra learns from the new maid that Mark gets dinner by dumbwaiter at exactly midnight and always leaves the laboratory no later than 2 am. She sets her alarm-clock for 3 am. Waking, she removes the tray from the dumbwaiter, climbs in, and hauls herself up to the laboratory. Once inside, there's a second room beyond a closed door and the light is on. She hears Mark ask someone named Laidell (we see it's a bearded man) if everything is all right at Three Hills. Laidell is concerned about filling prescriptions; Mark tells him to fill it in another town if necessary and not to worry about the local doctor, Mark will handle him. Mark comes into the room Sandra's in. She hides behind the door, but he notices the dumbwaiter is not where he left it and finds something in it. Glancing at the door behind which Sandra is hiding, he never-the-less leaves. Sandra returns via the dumbwaiter and is back in her room by 3:30.At 4 a woman screams. Sandra sees Mark running in the courtyard outside her window. Inside, Becket is seen hurrying along the upstairs pulling on his bathrobe.

But Lavinia's ex-suitor, Adam Brant, has become Christine's lover, and together Adam and Christine plot to poison Ezra.

                    The Manons - parents Ezra and Christine, and their grown adult children Lavinia (Vinnie to most who know her) and Orin - are a wealthy and well respected New England family. Ezra is a war hero and former mayor of the town in which they live. Vinnie and Orin seem destined to marry their childhood friends, brother and sister Peter and Hazel Niles. But most in town realize that the Manon's public facade masks some hidden issues. Indeed, the Manons are a dysfunctional family. Vinnie has a special bond with Ezra, and Orin has a special bond with Christine (Orin, a mama's boy, is called a cry baby by Vinnie), both relationships bordering on the romantic. For Ezra and Christine, that romantic love for their child replaces what is missing from their own marriage. Ezra states that he loves Christine, but feels she doesn't return that affection. He does not realize the true, deep seated hatred she has for him. The beginning of the end for the family starts while Ezra and Orin are away fighting in the Civil War, the hope for Orin being that the experience will turn him into a man. Vinnie, in love with a ship's captain named Adam Brant, learns that Adam is having an affair with her mother. Jealousy turns into hatred for both when Vinnie further learns of Adam's true parentage. As Adam and Christine plot for a life together, Vinnie, upon Orin and Ezra's return from the now ended war, tries to convince her brother, who has returned a war hero and therefore a man, of their mother's infidelity and the appropriate action to take. The resulting events ultimately place Orin and Vinnie at odds with each other, they who end up having different priorities in achieving love and happiness, or at least peace which seems to be missing from the Manon household.

                    After his family is murdered in the 1880s, orphan Jeb Rand is raised by the Callum family on their nearby horse ranch. He remains haunted by this childhood trauma in a recurring nightmare of flashing spurs and confinement inside a trap door as his family is slaughtered. Widow Callum does her best to make Jeb feel loved as he is growing up, but the young man stubbornly maintains a sense of his own identity. While he has great affection for his foster-sister Thor, his relationship with her brother Adam is tenuous at best, especially when Jeb blames him for shooting a colt that he was riding. Although Mrs. Callum blames the incident on deer hunters, she is aware that the it was actually the attempted murder of the youngster by her brother-in-law Grant, a shadowy figure who, for vague reasons, is determined to harm Jeb.

                    Writer Georges Duroy (George Sanders) is one social-climbing S.O.B. who does most of his climbing over the warm (and cold) bodies of women. He begins with Rachel (Marie Wilson), a hanger-on in the cafes and Folies Bergere crowd, and then moves on to dally with Clotilde de Morelle (Angela Lansbury). Always striving to move upward on the social scale, he ditches her to marry Madeleine Forestier (Ann Dvorak). Now he gets on the fast track. He persuades Madame Walter (Katherine Emery), the wife of his publisher, to fall in love with him, and then compromises Madeleine to frame a divorce, so he can pursue Madame Walter's daughter, Suzanne (Susan Douglas, before somebody decided her later-married name was her most-often used screen name). He moves along so well that ere long he is in legal position to usurp the title of one of France's most noble houses. The moral, at the end, is it is okay to mess with French women, but triffling with French titles is going too far.
