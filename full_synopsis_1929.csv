Lulu supports herself in a the apartment where we first meet her, funished nicely, including a painting of her as well as a large menorah. In the very first act what at first seems to be a pathetic beggar comes to the door, but it turns out that he's actually her conniving old pimp Schigolch (Carl Goetz) who's got plenty of money - and as the story plays out he helps himself to her money from the many companions she keeps. She is very cozy with him, though perhaps he would prefer more, and she refers to him as her first ""patron"". It is Lulu and her 'patron' who are behind the scenes in this movie. At the start Lulu's lover is the prestigious Dr. Ludwig Schoen (Fritz Kortner). Dr. Schoen comes to break their relationship, already scandalous, as he is engaged to be married to a woman who we soon meet, the minister of the Interior Herr von Zarnikos' daughter Charlotte Marie Adelaide. But Lulu won't be so easily dismissed. This is facilitated by Schigolgh's timely introduction of Lulu her to Rodrigo Quast (Carl Raschig) a variety acrobat that wants to put Lulu in one of his shows, and Lulu frankly admires his muscles.Lulu had become close friends with Dr. Schoen's son Alwa. In a possessive form of jealousy Dr. Schoen advises Alwa not to let Lulu do her trapeze act, but instead to put her in Alwas' revue.At the revue we find everyone glamorously dressed for the lavish dance variety show. There is a hustle and bustle backstage and when Lulu catches a glimpse of Dr. Schoens fiancée Charlotte, Lulu refuses to go on. This frustrates Dr. Schoen and he rushes her into an empty prop room where she plays a temper tantrum as she throws herself onto a bedded area against the prop shelves. She kicks her legs about, pulls and tugs at Dr. Schoen in a teasing manner that causes him to succumb to her after she sexily bites at his finger. They kiss and embrace and then the door opens allowing the director, Alwa and Charlotte to glimpse Dr. Schoens infidelity. This pleases Lulu as she smiles mischievously to everyone. She stands curtly and prances out of the room with a smug sense of satisfaction. She goes on with the performance while they are left to sort out the emotions they all are suffering over Lulu.The events of Dr. Schoens life are traumatically altered as he realizes that he is doomed to be in love with Lulu, which will in some way lead to his downfall. At their wedding reception Lulu is radiant in her white dress and her friends Schigolch and Rodrigo are in attendance. They both get quite intoxicated and Schigolch is determined to place a rose on the brides bed. In doing this it leads to a private party in the bedroom. Dr. Schoen enters the room to find Lulu his wife sitting in the lap of the debauched Schigolch with a Drunken Rodrigo nearby. This is too much for Dr. Schoen to allow. He silently has a mental snap, reaches for his hand gun and points it at Schigolch and Rodrigo but Lulu protests that he cannot shoot Schigologh - he's her father! Schifolch and Rodrigo scramble out of the room and into the continuing party in the adjoining room. Dr. Schoens threatens both Rodrigo and Schigolch by waving the firearm at them through the living room reception party until they exit the party. This shocks the guests and they all decide to leave. While this is going on, his son Alwa declares his love to Lulu and invites her to go with him on his train trip. He cradles his head on her lap and appears in ecstasy as she sits caressing him tenderly. Dr. Schoen goes back to the room and quickly warns his son not to miss his train. After Alwa leaves the room Dr. Schoen deliberately moves towards Lulu with an insane look in his eyes. She realizes he is not of right mind. For the first time she realizes that her behavior has gone too far as he jams the handgun into her delicate hand. He orders her to kill herself. This leads to a struggle which ends in Dr. Schoen being shot in the belly by his own weapon. As he slowly dies Alwa returns and as his father clutches his son in his last breaths he warns Alwa about Lulu and that he will be next.Lulu is charged by the courts and the prosecutor wants the death penalty. During the trial the prosecutor likens Lulu to the Greek Goddess Pandora an expert at flattery who opened the box given to her by the Gods and let evil loose upon the world. While the defense portrays Lulu as innocent, the prosecutor sees her as Pandora, and accuses her of leading Dr. Schoen to his demise. The trial ends up with Lulu getting a minimal prison sentence of five years, however her friends have other plans and they create a ruse by pulling the fire alarm, which provides them the chance to break Lulu free from her captivity.Lulu returns home to the scene of her crime as a fugitive. Alwa returns and wonders how she could feel comfortable in the place his fathers blood was shed. She picks up the phone ready to turn herself in until Alwa takes over the call to stop her from giving her location up.

She agrees to go with him as they hug romantically.On the ship ride Lulu is greeted by a nefarious gentleman who works behind the scenes to use her vulnerability of having a bounty on her head to sell her to an Egyptian who owns a place in Cairo where discriminating customers will take pleasure in Lulus company. Meanwhile Rodrigo is trying to drum up capital for another show and he tries to strong arm it out of Lulu. In her dismay over his domineering threats, she reverts to Schigolch for help who in his sleazy manner sits her on his lap telling her to cry it all away.

He is slyly conferring to Lulu that it is time for her to take on some customers for their survival on the streets. This is not a good time to be walking the streets as there have been several girls and women that have been killed by an unknown assailant who is known in history as Jack the Ripper. The tall handsome man that shared in cider with the young woman in the Christmas gathering meets Lulu and she immediately takes a liking to him. As she leads him to the room upstairs he holds a knife behind his back. He is the killer and she is unaware.

Inside, a Morse Code radio message containing an address is received. The van stops at a seedy building, and two plain clothes police go up some stairs. Quietly, they crack open the door of a room where a man lies atop a bed, reading a paper. A gun is on his bedside table. The man realizes he is about to be arrested and makes a move towards his gun, but the detectives move faster, and arrest him.The man is in a lineup in a patio with dozens of others. A young woman slowly passes by the men, and identifies the man, suggesting a rape charge will follow. The detectives work is finished, they ride home on a train. A fat man {Hitchcock} one seat away is being annoyed by a little boy who pulls down his hat,Scotland Yard Detective Frank Webber (John Longden) goes out for the evening with his capricious girlfriend Alice White (Anny Ondra), first going to a crowded tea house. As they jockey for a table, she misplaces one glove and Frank must go back to retrieve it.They bicker in a series of minor quarrels. Frank seems more interested in police work than in her. They talk about going to a movie, a new crime film. Frank scoffs, claiming its too unrealistic, but Alice comments: I heard they got a real criminal to direct it.Alice capriciously changes her mind back and forth driving Frank off. She has a note from another man arranging to meet in that teahouse, and she spots him and they make signs. Frank decides he has had enough, pays and leaves, but stays near the door.Alice leaves with Mr. Crewe (Cyril Ritchard), an artist. Frank sees them leaving the restaurant and follows them for a while.Alice is invited by Crewe to visit his studio, she demurs coyly but finally agrees. We learn that Alice lives with her father and mother in their tobacco shop, a short distance away.A suspicious looking man is lurking around, observing them.Crewe finds a note at the entrance. He goes behind the stairs ask the concierge Mrs. Humphries (Hannah Jones) at what time the note was left. Alice is already several steps up the stairs, so Mrs. Humphries does not see her.The camera follows Crewe and Alice as they climb multiple flights to the top floor. The artist's intentions are obvious, but Alice is unaware and innocently flirts with the artist by saying she might like to be his model, cooing with delight over his attentions.At his studio, a finished painting of a jester laughing at the viewer draws Alice's attention.Alice asks how the pallette is held, then paints a head on an empty canvas, which she playfully signs. Crewe then sketches a nude female body to go with the head. Crewe says he will paint her if she puts on a dancer's costume that is hanging on a screen.Crewe sings and plays ""Miss Up-to-Date"" on the piano while we watch Alice undress behind the screen.They have some fun and the guy tries to push too fast forward as he forces a kiss on Alice. She says she wants to go home. After she takes off the costume, he takes hold of her street clothes and flings them out of reach, and assaults her, dragging her to his bed.In silhouette we see the couple struggling wildly behind a curtain that hides the bed. A bobby patrolling outside below the apartment window while Alice screams hears nothing.To defend herself, Alice grabs a nearby knife and stabs him to death. She walks back from the bed in a daze, the knife gleaming in her hand.The jester painting appears to be looking at her, and she uses the knife to stab at the canvas.The camera swoops about to convey Alice's disorientation.Alice removes evidence of her presence in the flat. She obliterates her signature on the canvas and looks around carefully as she picks up her belongings.However, she forgets one glove behind. She sneaks noiselessly down stairs, opens the door and leaves. The mysterious man is still lurking around, watching.Alice walks aimlessly along empty streets which seem filled with reminders of the murder. In her eyes, a neon advertisement showing a cocktail shaker becomes a hand plunging a dagger. Whenever she sees an extended right hand, she thinks of Crewe's hand extending from the deathbed.Alice wanders back into her home at dawn and sneaks inside. She lies down clothed, pulls up the covers of her bed, and pretends to be asleep when her mother (Lisa Evans) brings her a cup of tea. After her mother leaves the room, Alice takes off her clothing and changes into a fresh outfit for the day.The concierge discovers the body very early that morning, calls police, and soon after, the murder is the talk of the neighborhood.During the family breakfast that morning, Alice listens to a customer neighbor carrying on about the killing. ""Oh, it wouldn't be so bad if the victim were bopped over the head with a brick -- that's a British way. But a knife! How could anyone use a knife?""Alice is asked to slice the bread, and her hand trembles as she grasps the knife. The neighbor babbles on. We hear only the word ""knife"" stabbing at Alice's conscience, the rest of visitor's nonstop comments become softer and softer, but the word KNIFE stays loud. A last one is practically a scream, and the bread knife leaps out of Alice's hand.Alice's father (Charles Paton) yells ""Ere! You might've cut someone with that!""Meantime, Frank has been assigned to the case and finds one of the gloves at the murder scene. He recognizes the glove as Alice's, so Frank uses his position to subvert the investigation by hiding it in his pocket. Assuming that Alice is the killer, he goes to visit Alice at her father's shop.Frank takes Alice aside to talk in a phone booth, making it clear it that he loves Alice and will protect her. He is clearly devastated as he confirms she indeed is the killer.At this point, petty thief Tracy (Donald Calthrop), the lurking suspicious figure who saw Alice entering and leaving the artist's flat, interrupts the two and attempts to blackmail the couple, showing he has the other glove with him. First he just asks Frank to pay for an expensive cigar.To gain time, Frank and Alice tell the family he is a very special business friend of Frank's. The blackmailer, befuddling Alice's parents, demands breakfast, and relishes it, while Frank watches in disgust.Frank predicts Tracy's blackmail will fail. His conflicted willingness to cover up for Alice receives an unexpected boost when Tracy is fingered as a suspect in Crewe's death. The concierge identifies him as being at the scene of the crime. Tracy has a police record so suspicion falls on him.Frank receives the new information and sneers when he goes back to face Tracy with it, and announces he has called the police to make an arrest. Cornered, slimy, but dirt-poor, Tracy offers to give back the money, and says he wasn't serious about the blackmail. ""One's got to live, you know!"" The same police van of the early scenes rushes along the streets.To avoid arrest, Tracy jumps out, shattering a back window. The camera, as if startled by the commotion, dollies backward and we see the posse of lawmen rushing after Tracy.After being taken into custody, while being transported in a van, Tracy simply jumps out of the van at a traffic stop, and the pursuit continues on foot. He attempts to shake off the pursuers by losing them inside the vast British museum.While the museum chase is going on, Alice sits in her bedroom, meditating and reflecting on her situation.The camera cuts back and forth between Alice's meditation and the chase. Tracy is first chased in large rooms with display cases, corridors, then Tracy flees down a hanging rope while an enormous Egyptian stone face stares impassively.After being surrounded, he clambers to the top of the main dome and dies after falling through the skylight.Alice's reflections end and she resolves to go to Scotland Yard and confess.She asks to talk to the chief inspector (Harvey Braban) about the murder. When she is ushered in, Frank is already there. She is interrupted before she has her say, first by Frank, who says her statement would be meaningless since the case is solved, and then by an unrelated phone call to the chief inspector. Frank escorts her out.She tells Frank that she killed Crewe, because she was about to be raped and was defending herself.Frank clenches his fists and stares towards the camera as if to claim his deception has been vindicated.As a piece of evidence, the painting of the torn jester, is brought into the station, the sight of it troubles Alice's conscience.All seems well between Alice and the relieved Frank, as he and Alice walk away together, hand in hand, yet one senses Alice's unease behind her eyes in the final images.","

                    Alice White, the daughter of a tobacconist, has been dating Frank Webber, a young up and coming detective at Scotland Yard. After successfully ditching Frank one evening on a date, Alice instead meets up with a young male artist who she really wanted to be with that evening. After going up to the artist's studio apartment, he tried to rape her. She ended up stabbing him to death in self defense, after which she tried to wipe out any evidence of being in his apartment, followed by sneaking out of the apartment and wandering the streets in a shocked daze over what she did. Frank ends up being one of the detectives assigned to the case, he who sees evidence only known to him of Alice having been in the artist's apartment, and recognizing the dead man as the person Alice sneaked off with after she ditched him the night before. Frank decides to hide the evidence he knows to implicate Alice from his fellow detectives but confront Alice with it to see what she says. But before she answers, an unsavory type named Tracy implies that he knows what happens and blackmails the pair in return for his silence. Eventually, Frank learns that Tracy is a wanted criminal. So Frank comes up with an idea of pinning the murder on Tracy. The questions become whether such a move will actually work, and if so whether Alice's conscience will allow an innocent man, however unsavory, be charged with a crime he didn't commit.

    Synopsis
    A tire is spinning. A police van speeds along city streets. Inside, a Morse Code radio message containing an address is received. The van stops at a seedy building, and two plain clothes police go up some stairs. Quietly, they crack open the door of a room where a man lies atop a bed, reading a paper. A gun is on his bedside table. The man realizes he is about to be arrested and makes a move towards his gun, but the detectives move faster, and arrest him.The man is in a lineup in a patio with dozens of others. A young woman slowly passes by the men, and identifies the man, suggesting a rape charge will follow. The detectives work is finished, they ride home on a train. A fat man {Hitchcock} one seat away is being annoyed by a little boy who pulls down his hat,Scotland Yard Detective Frank Webber (John Longden) goes out for the evening with his capricious girlfriend Alice White (Anny Ondra), first going to a crowded tea house. As they jockey for a table, she misplaces one glove and Frank must go back to retrieve it.They bicker in a series of minor quarrels. Frank seems more interested in police work than in her. They talk about going to a movie, a new crime film. Frank scoffs, claiming its too unrealistic, but Alice comments: I heard they got a real criminal to direct it.Alice capriciously changes her mind back and forth driving Frank off. She has a note from another man arranging to meet in that teahouse, and she spots him and they make signs. Frank decides he has had enough, pays and leaves, but stays near the door.Alice leaves with Mr. Crewe (Cyril Ritchard), an artist. Frank sees them leaving the restaurant and follows them for a while.Alice is invited by Crewe to visit his studio, she demurs coyly but finally agrees. We learn that Alice lives with her father and mother in their tobacco shop, a short distance away.A suspicious looking man is lurking around, observing them.Crewe finds a note at the entrance. He goes behind the stairs ask the concierge Mrs. Humphries (Hannah Jones) at what time the note was left. Alice is already several steps up the stairs, so Mrs. Humphries does not see her.The camera follows Crewe and Alice as they climb multiple flights to the top floor. The artist's intentions are obvious, but Alice is unaware and innocently flirts with the artist by saying she might like to be his model, cooing with delight over his attentions.At his studio, a finished painting of a jester laughing at the viewer draws Alice's attention.Alice asks how the pallette is held, then paints a head on an empty canvas, which she playfully signs. Crewe then sketches a nude female body to go with the head. Crewe says he will paint her if she puts on a dancer's costume that is hanging on a screen.Crewe sings and plays ""Miss Up-to-Date"" on the piano while we watch Alice undress behind the screen.They have some fun and the guy tries to push too fast forward as he forces a kiss on Alice. She says she wants to go home. After she takes off the costume, he takes hold of her street clothes and flings them out of reach, and assaults her, dragging her to his bed.In silhouette we see the couple struggling wildly behind a curtain that hides the bed. A bobby patrolling outside below the apartment window while Alice screams hears nothing.To defend herself, Alice grabs a nearby knife and stabs him to death. She walks back from the bed in a daze, the knife gleaming in her hand.The jester painting appears to be looking at her, and she uses the knife to stab at the canvas.The camera swoops about to convey Alice's disorientation.Alice removes evidence of her presence in the flat. She obliterates her signature on the canvas and looks around carefully as she picks up her belongings.However, she forgets one glove behind. She sneaks noiselessly down stairs, opens the door and leaves. The mysterious man is still lurking around, watching.Alice walks aimlessly along empty streets which seem filled with reminders of the murder. In her eyes, a neon advertisement showing a cocktail shaker becomes a hand plunging a dagger. Whenever she sees an extended right hand, she thinks of Crewe's hand extending from the deathbed.Alice wanders back into her home at dawn and sneaks inside. She lies down clothed, pulls up the covers of her bed, and pretends to be asleep when her mother (Lisa Evans) brings her a cup of tea. After her mother leaves the room, Alice takes off her clothing and changes into a fresh outfit for the day.The concierge discovers the body very early that morning, calls police, and soon after, the murder is the talk of the neighborhood.During the family breakfast that morning, Alice listens to a customer neighbor carrying on about the killing. ""Oh, it wouldn't be so bad if the victim were bopped over the head with a brick -- that's a British way. But a knife! How could anyone use a knife?""Alice is asked to slice the bread, and her hand trembles as she grasps the knife. The neighbor babbles on. We hear only the word ""knife"" stabbing at Alice's conscience, the rest of visitor's nonstop comments become softer and softer, but the word KNIFE stays loud. A last one is practically a scream, and the bread knife leaps out of Alice's hand.Alice's father (Charles Paton) yells ""Ere! You might've cut someone with that!""Meantime, Frank has been assigned to the case and finds one of the gloves at the murder scene. He recognizes the glove as Alice's, so Frank uses his position to subvert the investigation by hiding it in his pocket. Assuming that Alice is the killer, he goes to visit Alice at her father's shop.Frank takes Alice aside to talk in a phone booth, making it clear it that he loves Alice and will protect her. He is clearly devastated as he confirms she indeed is the killer.At this point, petty thief Tracy (Donald Calthrop), the lurking suspicious figure who saw Alice entering and leaving the artist's flat, interrupts the two and attempts to blackmail the couple, showing he has the other glove with him. First he just asks Frank to pay for an expensive cigar.To gain time, Frank and Alice tell the family he is a very special business friend of Frank's. The blackmailer, befuddling Alice's parents, demands breakfast, and relishes it, while Frank watches in disgust.Frank predicts Tracy's blackmail will fail. His conflicted willingness to cover up for Alice receives an unexpected boost when Tracy is fingered as a suspect in Crewe's death. The concierge identifies him as being at the scene of the crime. Tracy has a police record so suspicion falls on him.Frank receives the new information and sneers when he goes back to face Tracy with it, and announces he has called the police to make an arrest. Cornered, slimy, but dirt-poor, Tracy offers to give back the money, and says he wasn't serious about the blackmail. ""One's got to live, you know!"" The same police van of the early scenes rushes along the streets.To avoid arrest, Tracy jumps out, shattering a back window. The camera, as if startled by the commotion, dollies backward and we see the posse of lawmen rushing after Tracy.After being taken into custody, while being transported in a van, Tracy simply jumps out of the van at a traffic stop, and the pursuit continues on foot. He attempts to shake off the pursuers by losing them inside the vast British museum.While the museum chase is going on, Alice sits in her bedroom, meditating and reflecting on her situation.The camera cuts back and forth between Alice's meditation and the chase. Tracy is first chased in large rooms with display cases, corridors, then Tracy flees down a hanging rope while an enormous Egyptian stone face stares impassively.After being surrounded, he clambers to the top of the main dome and dies after falling through the skylight.Alice's reflections end and she resolves to go to Scotland Yard and confess.She asks to talk to the chief inspector (Harvey Braban) about the murder. When she is ushered in, Frank is already there. She is interrupted before she has her say, first by Frank, who says her statement would be meaningless since the case is solved, and then by an unrelated phone call to the chief inspector. Frank escorts her out.She tells Frank that she killed Crewe, because she was about to be raped and was defending herself.Frank clenches his fists and stares towards the camera as if to claim his deception has been vindicated.As a piece of evidence, the painting of the torn jester, is brought into the station, the sight of it troubles Alice's conscience.All seems well between Alice and the relieved Frank, as he and Alice walk away together, hand in hand, yet one senses Alice's unease behind her eyes in the final images.

                    Queen Louise's cabinet are worried that she will become an old maid, and are delighted when she marries the rougish Count Renard. Unfortunately, he finds his position as Queen's Consort unsatisfying and without purpose, and the marriage soon runs into difficulties.

                    Foremost on the minds of the subjects of Sylvania is when their beloved monarch, Queen Louise, will get married. Queen Louise, on the other hand, has no intention of doing so. Despite the Queen's beauty, she would have a difficult time finding a mate anyway because her husband would not be considered king - he would be given the title of prince consort - but have many of the responsibilities as a royal figurehead. Things change when one of her military attachés, Count Alfred Renard, is sent back to Sylvania from his posting in Paris for a reprimand by the Queen due to his womanizing ways. They, attracted to each other, decide to get married. Life for the Prince Consort ends up not being as he envisioned. He feels he has nothing to do while the Queen, wearing the proverbial pants of the family, attends to her duties. In addition, he is supposed to obey her commands, not only as one of her loyal subjects but also as her husband. The Prince Consort showing public dissatisfaction with the marriage could prove fatal not only to the marriage but also to Sylvania as a country, unless he can show the Queen a different style of monarchy.

Meanwhile, singing Queen Louise of Sylvania is being badgered by her cabinet to marry. Expecting disgrace, Renard finds instead that he's just what the Queen had in mind for a consort. But he finds the subordinate status of a prince consort increasingly hard to take.

                    Count Alfred has disgraced his home country of Sylvania with one too many scandalous affairs with married women, and the ambassador of Sylvania commands him to return home. Alfred's manservant, Jacques, begs to come along, and his master relents. Alfred, burdened with a newly acquired French accent that makes him sound most un-Sylvanian, fears the wrath of his queen. But instead of having him shot, she falls in love with him, and he with her. The entire kingdom, which has had nothing on its mind except seeing the queen get married, is thrilled. As Jacques and Lulu the maid conduct their own romance, reveling in their commonness, Alfred discovers at the altar that his own marriage will be most uncommon - and a dire threat to his manhood. He may be marrying a queen, but he most definitely won't be a king.

                    Lillie Sterling comes with her husband, John, on a business trip to Java, expecting a second honeymoon. On the ship, she witnesses Javanese Prince De Gace mercilessly whipping a servant and shrinks in horror from the sight. When John is befriended by the Prince, who is very attracted to Lillie, she tries to have little to do with him. During a conversation in their room, John is called away to answer a wire, and the Prince steals a kiss in his absence, for which she slaps him. So she is understandably upset when John accepts the Prince's invitation to stay at his plantation in Java when he promised to arrange a tiger hunt. She tries to dissuade John from going, but John says he always wanted to shoot a tiger and she is being unreasonable. Once at the plantation, John is too busy to pay much attention to Lillie, and when he is away, the Prince tries to seduce her. Lillie flees in tears after another kiss, afraid of her own emotions. Finally, she embraces the Prince when he tries again, after John has left to see other plantations. But he returns early and sees their silhouette against the shade, his first awareness of what was going on. Alerted by the sound of the gate opening, the Prince quickly sends Lillie to her room and substitutes a servant in his arms. But the ploy doesn't work as John find Lillie's trinket on the sofa. John suggests tiger hunting at night and goads the Prince into going with him. A tiger is spotted and when the Prince lifts his gun and fires, it becomes apparent John removed the bullets from his gun. Stunned by facing both the tiger and an angry John with a loaded gun, he flees, with the tiger in pursuit. John raises his gun and fires.

                    Biopic of the famed British Prime Minister focusing on his concern about Russia's growing interest in the Indian subcontinent and his attempts to buy the Suez Canal. He sees the Canal as the key strategic resource in maintaining the Empire in the East but is unpopular in many quarters. With antisemitism rife at the time, Disraeli finds little support for his plan to purchase the canal or his foreign policy in general. There is no doubt that the Russians are plotting against British interests and he is surrounded by spies, even in his office at 10 Downing St. When the Bank of England refuses to finance the purchase of the available shares he turns to private sources to raise the available cash only to find the conspirators one step ahead of him.

                    Conrad Nagel, representing the Hollywood movie community, and Jack Benny, representing the Broadway stage community, act as the interlocutors of a musical comedy revue. A plethora of chorus boys and girls are featured front and center in some of the song and dance numbers, and provide back-up to some other acts. But the revue primarily is a vehicle to highlight a cavalcade of Hollywood movie and Broadway stage stars. One early running gag has both Nagel and Benny playing straight man to Cliff Edwards, who just wants a nice introduction to his act. Edwards would return later to be featured along with the Brox Sisters in one of the highlights of the second act, a production number around the song ""Singin' in Rain"", complete with rain soaked stage. A reprise of the song with the entire cast acts as the revue's finale.

But Baptista will not allow the two to get married until his eldest daughter, the extremely headstrong Katherine, is betrothed. This task seems impossible because of Katherine's shrewish demeanor. They believe their prayers have been answered with the arrival from Verona of the lusty Petruchio, whose father has just passed, leaving him to travel the world and marry. Having not yet met her, Petruchio agrees to court Katherine when he is told of her beauty and wit. Petruchio is even more excited at the prospect of marrying this wildcat of a woman after meeting her.

                    King Louis XIII of France is thrilled to have born to him a son - an heir to the throne. But when the queen delivers a twin, Cardinal Richelieu sees the second son as a potential for revolution, and has him sent off to Spain to be raised in secret to ensure a peaceful future for France. Alas, keeping the secret means sending Constance, lover of D'Artagnan, off to a convent. D'Artagnan hears of this and rallies the Musketeers in a bid to rescue her. Unfortunately, Richelieu out-smarts the Musketeers and banishes them forever. Richelieu enlists D'Artagnan to look after and protect the young prince. Meanwhile, de Rochefort learns of the twins and Richelieu's plans, and kidnaps the twin, raising him in secret. Many years later, with Richelieu dead and the young prince crowned King Louis XIV, Rochefort launches his plan. The king is kidnapped, replaced with his twin, put in an iron mask so as not to be recognized, and led off to a remote castle to be held prisoner. Louis XIV is able to alert D'Artagnan, who realizes that only his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis can help him, so he reunites the Musketeers to derail Rochefort's nefarious plot but at a heavy toll.

While on board Bobby meets the femme fatale cougar, Mme. de Sylva, who immediately desires the young man and easily seduces him. In reality, she is Toyo's mother and a notoriously predatory seductress. Tiger adamantly insinuates himself between de Sylva and her latest conquest and seemingly breaks up the romance and returns home to oversee Toyo and Bobby's wedding, but Toyo's mother unexpectedly arrives with the objective of vamping Bobby.

    Synopsis
    The film begins with Peabody Jr. (Neil Hamilton) and friends preparing to frolic into the night before Jr. must begin work the following day at his father's department store. Before departing, Peabody Sr. (Edward Martindale) lectures his son about the women of the day and that all the cuties at the store are off limits.
In the meantime, Pert Kelly (Colleen Moore), after winning a dance contest is being wooed by gentlemen of questionable character. All parties end up having a wild time at ""The Boiler"" where Pert catches the eye of Peabody Jr. who gives her a ride home and schedules a date for the following night. Pert is tardy to work as she was up until 3 and must report to the personnel office where she is surprised to find Peabody Jr. working. Peabody Sr. is there, figures out what's going on, and terminates Pert's employment.
Peabody Jr. must wait several hours past the scheduled date before he can talk to Pert and explain he did not do the firing. They schedule another date.
Lavish gifts arrive for Pert to wear to the next date. She gets lectured by Pa Kelly (John St. Polis) about the lack of virtues of the ""modern"" man. Similarly Peabody Jr. is again lectured about the ""modern"" woman by Peabody Sr.
On the next date, Junior arranges a test of Pert's virtue which she passes with ease and they arrive back home to prove her virtue to Senior who now cannot refute it.

                    A partly fictionalized account of history begins with the arrival of slatternly Emma Hart, a cook's daughter, at the home of Charles Greville. Greville takes her as his lover and grooms her until their relationship becomes an inconvenience. Greville then dupes Emma into traveling to Naples to live with his uncle, Lord Hamilton, ambassador to the court at Naples. Realizing that Greville has abandoned her, Emma agrees to marry Lord Hamilton. Soon, however, she meets Admiral Horatio Nelson of the British Navy. Emma plays a crucial role in convincing Naples to open its ports to Nelson during his campaign against Napoleon's French fleet. Soon, Emma and the married Nelson become romantically involved -- a relationship which will have consequences for them both.

                    In the late eighteenth century, Lady Hamilton has had a somewhat turbulent relationship with the British people, especially the aristocracy. Born Emma Hart from a very humble background (she being the daughter of a cook), she was seen as being vulgar by the rich, but equally captivating for her beauty. In a move to protect his inheritance, Honorable Charles Greville, Emma's then lover and her mother's employer, sent Emma to Naples under false pretenses to live with his uncle, Sir William Hamilton, where she would study to become a lady. Surprisingly to Greville whose deception Emma would eventually discover, Emma ended up becoming Hamilton's wife in a marriage of convenience. But it is Emma's eventual relationship with Horatio Nelson of the British navy that would cause the largest issue. A move by Lady Hamilton helped Nelson's armada defeat Napoleon's fleet in naval battles, which Nelson would have ultimately lost without Lady Hamilton's help. Beyond the dangers of war, Lady Hamilton and Nelson's relationship is ultimately threatened by the court of public opinion as both are married to other people.

Shortly after, Colonel Beetham and Galt have an argument in Galt's office witnessed by Galt's aide. Late that night, Galt is killed at his office, and a pair of Chinese slippers are placed on the dead man's feet by the murderer, who, when he flees, is observed and followed by the building's night watchman, a low, but cunning Cockney type, who will later blackmail Durand. Next day, Eve and Durand confront Sir George (who favors Beetham as an in-law and helps to finance his exploring expeditions) with the news that they have been married the night before - apparently Durand had saved Eve's life - ""something any man would do."" Sir George turns his metaphorical back on the couple, and they leave for India for no particular reason. Beetham prepares to leave for the ""deserts of Persia."" Meanwhile Sir Frederick of the Yard - who speaks more slowly than your average person on the edge of mortality - by the way, British and American accents are parceled out randomly among the characters - has called his friend Chan, the latter having explained that the slippers had been a gift from the emperor of China to Beetham for meritorious service and that their embroidery means, ""Walk lightly, go far."" This is odd because the film is made and ends in 1929 though it begins several years earlier, Beetham appears to be meant to be in his early thirties, and the last emperor of China (a child) was overthrown in 1912. Anyway, Sir Frederick notes, ""The Chinese - they see things that we don't."" In India, a year later, the Durands are living quietly, if unhappily for Eve. Her uncle has died, apparently of heartbreak. Her husband sits around drinking whiskey-sodas - ""strong ones"" and having an affair with their servant girl who fans him and sings the same song over and over. Eve serendipitously runs into Beetham in the market - he is leaving for Persia the next day. He swears to take care of her if she should need him. Eve goes home and finds a: one of the singing servant's earrings on her bed and b: a letter from the Cockney porter back in England who has not been receiving his 100 pound stipends and who hints strongly that Durand killed Galt. Eve confronts Durand, who more or less admits things. She says she will not make a scandal or divorce him, but he needs to stay away from her. He tries to break in her bedroom door, and she flees to Beetham and begs him to take her with him so that she can ""totally disappear"" in the dunes of Persia. Beetham reluctantly agrees - there is danger (which we never see) but he loves her. Sir Frederick (of the Yard) has been following these people around the world for the past year. He drops in on Durand (whom he suspects as the man is an obvious bounder) to talk to Eve. Then he, Durand and a Persian official fly a monoplane to Beecham's encampment. They search for Eve, but Sir Frederick (who knows a gentleman when he sees one) makes it clear that he really hasn't tried to find her, though he knows she is there because of Beetham's sketches of her on his maps. Beetham's servant (played by Boris Karloff) leads Durand astray. Sir Frederick enjoins Beetham on his honor to meet with him the next day in Teheran and to bring Eve. (If he is only a day away from Teheran, one wonders what Beetham is exploring.) Anyway, Eve has already fled on horseback, and Beetham's party make no attempt to go after her, though later Beetham will say that he had been searching for several days before he comes to see Sir Frederick. Another year passes. Eve is taking the ferry into San Francisco when she reads that Beetham is to give a lecture that night - she saves the clipping and goes to her job as an elevator operator. Durand comes on the elevator and she stops it between floors. He has already killed the blackmailing cockney and tries to force Eve to give him the incriminating letter or he will kill her too. Under duress she agrees, takes Durand to the fifth floor, pushes him out the door, plummets the elevator to the lobby and flees to her apartment. As she arrives, two Chinese detectives from the San Francisco Police who have ransacked her room and found the letter are leaving. (One of them is said to be Chan.) Eve determines to go to Beetham at his lecture. Sir Frederick has instructed Chan to have the place heavily guarded, but to allow Durand to get in. Eve quietly enters the back of the hall and takes a seat. Beetham sees her, and, instead of delivering his lecture, begins talking about love, much to the mystification of his audience. Durand appears at a side door with a gun and a bad twitch. He attempts to shoot Eve, but Sir Frederick takes the bullet - only a flesh wound. Beetham and Eve explain everything, and the news comes that Durand has been killed resisting arrest, probably because Chan (whom we do not see) thought the world would be better off without Durand. The lovers embrace (off camera), and Sir Frederick takes his leave for the hospital, saying, ""We have walked softly, gone far, and now the journey is ended.""

How could the love story between a young sales girl and a soldier unable to decide if he was pro or against the radical fashion? Two short months were needed for the answer to be found - in blood and tears, and under rain that washes all past memories. Any day, a New Babylon shop will open with frilly things for the bourgeois girls. The washerwomen will be there to wash them.
