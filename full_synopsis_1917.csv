                    Rapsodia Satanica (1915) was the last film directed by Nino Oxilia and is undoubtedly one of the finest achievements of the early Italian cinema. In it, Oxilia spins a variation on the Faust myth, embodied here by the diva Lyda Borelli. Typical of extravagant D'Annunzian aestheticism at its height, Rapsodia Satanica was one of the summits of what was later called the ""tail coat film."" Diametrically opposed to the ""cinema of reality"" practiced by Serena, Martoglio and others, ""tail coat films"" set their melodramatic stories in the salons and villas of the upper middle class and the aristocracy, deploying narrative structures contrived to showcase their actors and especially its actresses. This had the effect of accentuating their physical presence and turning them into stars - probably the first stars in movie history. The success of the ""dive"" contributed to the development of motion picture grammar in its special use of the close-up.

Traveling to visit her ancestral estate in France, Angela's luxury ocean liner is sunk by a German U-boat that erroneously believes it to be carrying munitions. Despite the horrific loss of life, she is rescued and ultimately arrives at the family chateau. Because her aunt has died, she inherits the estate, which is commandeered by the Germans as a command post and billet for soldiers. Outraged at the brutal violation of female servants by the barbaric soldiers and the summary execution of a benign old man, she urges Karl, who is among the officers, to put a stop to these war atrocities. When his strict Prussian training trumps his humanity, Angela renounces her neutrality and uses her position in the house to transmit intelligence about the position of the German guns to Jules and the French artillery.

                    Angela More's birthday is the Fourth of July. Count Jules De Destin, an attaché of the French embassy, appears with a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers, but Angela's interest is centered in Karl Von Austreim, a German-American. Karl, to please his father, has been educated in Germany, and received his military training in the German army. Jules is about to propose, when the butler announces Karl. He has a box of candy to which is fastened a silk American flag, and the candy is arranged in the same design. Jules realizes he has lost, and after he has retired Karl proposes. He has just been accepted when he is summoned to meet a man who insists upon seeing him. The stranger tells him to report in Germany at once. Karl, unable to explain, asks Angela to wait for him. One day Jules tells her France and Germany are at war, and Angela is horrified, but relieved at her understanding of Karl's departure. Angela has an aunt in France in the town of Vangy. The aunt lost her grandson in battle, and writes Angela's father asking that she be sent to bring her and her family back to America. Angela writes to Karl, and departs on one of the largest ocean liners. The captain receives word that they are nearing the submarine zone, and orders everything darkened. A German spy leaves two portholes open; the lights are seen by the commander of a submarine, who fires. The boat slowly fills and lists. The ball room is flooded. Angela finally reaches the deck. She gives her life preserver to an older woman and jumps into the water. Coming to the surface she sees an empty raft and pulls herself on board. The next morning she is picked up by a patrol boat. Karl receives the letter, and is making merry in a captured French home when they receive the news of the torpedoing of the Veritania. Karl is horror stricken. The captain commands that they drink to the commander of the submarine. Angela's aunt passes away a short time before Angela arrives. The French commander warns that the Germans are approaching, and Angela and her women servants are preparing to depart when the French bring their wounded into the chateau. Angela refuses to leave. Her servants remain with her. Jules arranges with a spy to have a telephone hidden in the chateau. He encounters Angela, who is heartbroken to find he has lost his right arm in battle. He explains she can do a great service if she will permit the spy to serve as butler. Angela consents. She does her best to look after the French wounded, and entertains them. Soon the Germans come. They fire into the dwelling, killing the spy, and batter down the door. Angela protests that the chateau is the residence of American citizens, and shows her flag. Realizing her beauty, several of the officers start for her, and she flees. Angela dashes into a darkened room, Karl follows. Believing Angela has been drowned Karl forgets his manliness and is about to force a kiss, when his elbow hits the electric switch and the sweethearts stand face to face. Angela is horrified, Karl humiliated. He explains he believed her dead; she demands that he protect her women servants. Karl explains that he cannot give orders to his superiors. The commanding officer arrives, makes her remove and dry his muddy boots. Karl secures a pass for Angela, but she sees a line of peasants fall before a firing squad, and tears up her pass, announcing that she will remain. She creeps to the fire place and telephones Jules where the German guns are placed. The French wreck one of the big Howitzers. The second shot hits close to another, and the colonel realizes someone is telephoning the range. Karl finds the wire outlet, and discovers Angela. He urges her to flee. The colonel is knocking at the door, Angela realizes if Karl lets her go, he will be shot, so she pulls down her hair and pretends to struggle. The men believe Karl has captured her and he is congratulated. By a court martial Angela is ordered shot because she refuses to reply to the German third degree. Karl revolts. He flings his sword at the feet of the Colonel and says, ""I am done with you and your Emperor. I was blind to your system. Now, thank God, I see!"" The Colonel orders the woman shot as a spy and the man for treason. Jules has heard Angela scream, orders all guns concentrated on the chateau. Karl and Angela are led before the firing squad. Just as they are about to fire, an avalanche of French shells descends. Karl and Angela are buried in the debris, and chateau is in flames. Finally they crawl forth and Angela, leads Karl through the shells of No Man's Land. Unable to make the distance, they conceal themselves in a church. The two collapse at the foot of a cross as a shell wrecks the building. Next morning, Jules sees two figures at the foot of the cross and discovers them to be Angela and the German-American. Angela pleads for Karl and he is put in a concentration camp. Jules sets about to acquaint the government of Angela's heroism, and one day she is presented with an official document granting Karl's release and transport to America, and the other prisoners are horrified to see a fashionably dressed little American pressing her face against the wires of the detention pen to be kissed by the disheveled German prisoner.

He has named his horse ""Dream Girl"" after the girl of the photograph. After several years in an eastern college, Texas return home. Her father is happy and she is idolized by the cowboys of the ranch. Antonio Moreno is the head of a band of cattle rustlers. His lieutenant, ""Dice"" McAllister, a former road agent, uses his office as marshal as a cloak for unlawful deeds. Moreno and McAllister have long plotted to secure Ryan's wealth, and Moreno resolves to pay court to the girl. In the ""Last Chance"" saloon and dance hall a shooting scrape occurs. Jack Parker, enemy of McAllister, is charged as being an accessory. Harsh words are exchanged and Parker overcomes McAllister in a desperate conflict, and then crosses the border until the disturbance blows over. He returns on the Fourth of July and proceeds to celebrate. Colonel Ryan and Texas meet him and Parker learns she is the girl of the photograph. Moreno and his gang, under pretense of friendship, visit the Ryan ranch during the round-up, and when Texas spurns the Mexican's offer of marriage, he threatens her, and is driven from the ranch. When Texas and her girlfriend, Marion Smith, are riding in the hills, they are seen by Moreno's men. Texas is pursued and made prisoner. Marion brings the news to Colonel Ryan.

During a night of rain and wind he slips into the camp of the outlaws, takes Moreno a prisoner, and leaves a note telling McAllister of what he has done. When McAllister finds the note in the morning, he decides to leave the country. Moreno later makes his escape. Parker decides to go on the trail. He bids Texas farewell, telling her he is not worthy of her. As time passes Texas comes to understand that she loves the cowpuncher. Moreno continues his lawlessness. After a desperate conflict Parker is taken prisoner. Word is brought to Texas Ryan that he is to be shot that evening. The girl tells her father she believes the cattle thieves will spare Jack's life for money and starts in an automobile on her race with death. Moreno gloats over the revenge. The executioner awaits the order to fire. Just as Moreno is about to give the order, Texas arrives. The cupidity of the Mexican bandits is aroused by the gold, and the cowpuncher is freed and takes Texas into his arms.

                    Ramona is the daughter of the governor of Port Royal. She is a school girl living in Spain. John Barton, a soldier of fortune, is cast ashore in Spain penniless and scrapes an acquaintance with Ramona by rescuing one of her pets. He is putting up at a rather questionable tavern where he learns of a huge treasure buried by Firebrand, a pirate, and secures plans of the spot in which it is concealed. Ramona sails for Port Royal and Barton is on the same ship. Firebrand attacks the ship and captures as part of his booty Ramona, whom he appropriates for himself after Barton has been knocked overboard in her defense. Until the acquisition of Ramona, Firebrand's favorite has been Anna, who now becomes jealous of the Spanish beauty. After attempting to make Ramona accept his attentions peacefully, Firebrand vents his wrath upon her and orders her confined in one of his cabins. Barton, recovering from his injuries sufficiently to make his way ashore, stumbles upon the cabin in which Ramona is a prisoner but the jealous Anna discovers him and informs Firebrand of the supposed duplicity of his new favorite. The pirate chief rushes to the cabin and when he attempts to force his attentions upon Ramona she kills him. Anna denounces Ramona as the culprit and, in a fit of vengeance, suggests that Ramona be sold as a slave in the public market. Her rare beauty causes lively bidding among the men who attend the sale. Meanwhile Barton has gone in search of the buried treasure and has found it. He has bought a horse on which he comes in search of Ramona, only to find her on the slave block, with a horde of men frantically bidding for her. Plunging into the crowd, he fights his way to the front and forces the bidding until, after a soul-stirring scene, he succeeds in vanquishing his rivals, and rides off triumphant in search of a minister.

Brown takes the dead man's clothes and papers and is able to pass himself off as a good citizen in 1850's Calaveras County. When Lawrence's sister dies, her daughter spends the little money she has to journey to California and live with her uncle. Arriving at the isolated cabin, she realizes he is an impostor, but his threats intimidate her into silence. Lacking money and protection, she immediately becomes vulnerable to the advances of the largely all-male population, and so must acknowledge Brown publicly as her uncle in order to continue to receive food, shelter, and his protection. Over time, this understanding of mutual convenience turns to affection, and he pledges to reform. When former members of his gang continue their dishonest ways, however, the now rehabilitated Brown falls under the suspicion of the local vigilante committee.

A square-jawed woman, a miserly old man, a brutal fellow, with bull-dog features, and a ponderous, harsh, mannish looking women, each agree to take a child. When it dawns upon Mona and her brothers and sisters that they are to be separated they break into tears and beg piteously to be allowed to remain together. Their pleas are ignored. Finally Mona begs that they be allowed to spend a last night together on the Fairfax farm. The request finally is granted. That night Mona hitches the family horse to a rickety old wagon and the children set out to escape. They fall asleep and the horse stops near Banning's house. The housekeeper takes them in during the master's absence. When Banning returns he is furious. Mona offers him a wisp of flowers, which he scorns. Finally, however, the child's smile wins his heart and he cuddles her. Later when agents of the welfare society try to take the children, Banning drives them from his place, declaring he will adopt Young Mother Hubbard and her entire family.

                    Marcia Manot, a simple Breton fisher maiden, has found an exquisite emerald, once the property of an ancient Norse queen. The stone is supposed to be cursed, because it was wrested by her from a Christian priest. Silas Martin, the avaricious American owner of large Breton fisheries, marries Marcia to gain possession of the stone, while she marries him in the hope of persuading him to better the condition of his employees. She soon finds that the stone is his sole interest, and that he has planned to divorce her, by compromising her with his business manager, Sterling. In an effort to regain possession of the stone she kills Martin in self-defense and believes the curse to be working, but eventually the stone is given to the priest, that the curse may be lifted, and Marcia escapes the fancied penalty.

                    William Baldwin, ruined in business by his partner, John Blaisdell, implores Blaisdell's aid, and receives in answer a five-dollar bill across the face of which is written, ""Spend this for a gun and use it on yourself."" Hopelessly, Baldwin and his daughter, Nan, go to the Yukon, where the father soon dies, and the daughter earns a living in a rough dance-hall, where as ""Nightingale Nan"" she is the idol of the miners. When Nan discovers that the little claim on Bear creek, the only thing her father has left her, is worthless, she at first collapses. Then she becomes defiant, and tells the miners who have been forcing their attentions upon her that they may have her, the lucky man to be the winner in a card-game, she to take the money won in the game and go away to seek fame and fortune. A bearded stranger wins the game with a pair of deuces, pays her $1,000 a card, and she leaves with him for her cabin. Once there, however, she repents her rash bargain, and implores him to release her, offering the money in return. He makes her sign an I.O.U. for herself, promising to pay the debt at any time in the future that he may see fit. ""You'll win success,"" the stranger tells her, ""but in the hour of your greatest triumph I shall claim you, and you must return."" She leaves on this condition. Nan's voice wins success for her all over the world. As Mlle. Nanon Boldini five years later she is the reigning operatic queen at La Scala, Milan, and then comes to the Metropolitan opera house. New York, to make her American debut in ""Lucia di Lammermoor."" Her success is instantaneous. Two of the most important patrons of the opera house, John Blaisdell and James Van Brunt, business rivals, are united in their admiration of Mlle. Boldini, and obtain an introduction. When Nan discovers the identity of Blaisdell, the man who ruined her father, she says nothing, but quietly plans his downfall. She encourages his attention, even at the risk of displeasing a young stranger with whom she has fallen in love. She refuses an offer of marriage from the man who has won her heart, telling him of her promise made under amazing conditions to a man in Alaska five years ago. That promise, she tells him, must be fulfilled, no matter how great the sacrifice she makes in doing so. Inviting Blaisdell to her apartment to dinner, she has a telephone connection so arranged that James Van Brunt, at his downtown office with the receiver at his ear, hears Blaisdell's answers to the carefully prepared questions Nan asks, betraying all his business secrets. As Blaisdell falls across the table in a drunken stupor, after having told everything, Nan's triumph is complete. It is at this moment that two fateful cards, the deuces with which the Alaskan won his game, are thrust under the door, and Nan falls fainting. Next day she prepares for her journey to the northland, ready to pay the price of her five years' freedom. The man she loves insists on accompanying her. Going to her little cabin, she finds it sumptuously furnished. As she turns to her lover in surprise, he places on the table a crumpled ""I.O.U."" then tears it in two, giving her the pieces. As the realization slowly dawns on Nan that the man she has learned to love is the bearded stranger of so long ago, she fits the two pieces of the ""I.O.U."" together again, and presenting them to him, creeps into the arms of her stranger-lover.

                    In old Puritan Boston some two hundred and fifty years ago a girl was born. Her mother was Hester Prynne. Her father was ""unknown."" This story opens as Hester Prynne is led to the pillory. On her breast is a scarlet ""A."" In her arms lies the infant Pearl. The Rev. Wilson and the Governor urge her to reveal the name of the child's father. She refuses and the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale is asked to plead with her. She does not heed the pastor's request to reveal the name of the father of her child. A bent old man enters the square. He recognizes Hester and she him. Hate sweeps his face. Hester is taken back to prison and the old man, Chillingworth, is admitted to her cell as a physician. He is Hester's husband. He berates her and leaves, threatening to drag her lover from his hiding. Next day Hester goes to live in a cottage beyond the settlement. She endures insults and humiliation. Meantime, Rev. Dimmesdale's health gives way under a strange malady. Chillingworth is told to care for him. Years pass and Pearl grows into girlhood. The heads of the colony seek to separate her from Hester and raise her under the church. Hester resists in vain, but Dimmesdale's plea saves the little family. Chillingworth comments on the earnestness of the pastor's plea. A few days later, Dimmesdale sees Pearl in the cemetery near his home. With burrs she has formed an ""A"" on her breast. Dimmesdale staggers to his bed and falls unconscious. To revive the pastor, Chillingworth opens his shirt. He seems to see a scarlet ""A"" branded on Dimmesdale's chest. Chilingworth glares with fiendish glee. Regaining consciousness late in the night, the pastor runs into the square and mounts the pillory, crying out to the sleeping town. He faints and recovers as Hester and Pearl enter at dawn. He calls them and together they stand on the pillory. When the town begins to stir they go to the beach. Hester begs Dimmesdale to flee with her and the child to another land. The pastor embraces the woman and child. Chillingworth watches from behind a rock. In parting Hester casts away the scarlet ""A."" Chillingworth cries out to the town that Hester has bewitched Dimmesdale. Guards seize her in her cottage and drag her to the square. Attracted by the tumult, Dimmesdale rushes into the square as Hester is being tied to the stake. Pushing through the frenzied mob he stands beside her. As he confesses himself the father of Pearl, he tears open his shirt and reveals an ""A"" seared on his chest. The throng draws back in awe. Hester frees herself and catches Dimmesdale as he falls. She lifts his head into her lap; he opens his eyes, kisses Hester and Pearl and dies.

While searching the mountains for the bird, Lopaka encounters a dying priest of Pele who sells him a wishing bottle in which Kono, the god of the volcanos, is confined. The priest warns him of the dangers of the bottle: if he dies still owning it, he will be damned, and the only way to get rid of it is to sell it for a price smaller than was paid for it. Lopaka agrees and wishes to be rich, then marries Kokua and sells the bottle. All is well until Lopaka contracts leprosy. To get rid of it, he must acquire the bottle again, and he is forced to buy it for the smallest coin of the realm! To save her husband's soul, Kokua is ready to sacrifice herself by buying the bottle for a smaller French coin. Fortunately, a wicked sailor appears with a still smaller Chinese coin and becomes its final owner when the bottle is lost at sea.

At the El Tovar hotel, we meet the villainous Navajo Chin-de-dah, who lives in a secret cliff-house deep in the Grand Canyon, who leads Forrest and Marjorie to his lair with ""forced marriage"" on his mind. With the assistance of one of Chin-de-dah's henchmen, Ned Thacker descends the cliffs on a rope and effects a rescue. While the villain is a very unfortunate Indian stereotype, the footage of the Grand Canyon and Canyon de Chelly is spectacular, and taken in the spirit it was intended, this is a fun, somewhat carelessly constructed romp, and a good example of why Douglas Fairbanks was so popular. In the surviving material shown at the Buster Keaton Festival, some confusion is caused when Forrest Vandeteer's name changes to Forrest Barris part way through, probably because of a difference in the source material.","
    
                    Ned Thacker, through prenatal suggestion, is born in Kansas with the spirit of D'Artagnan, of Gascony, and, naturally, his gallantries are very much misunderstood by maids and matrons of today, but when he falls in love with Dorothy Morane it takes something more than a millionaire rival to head him off, and it takes even more than a half-crazed Indian guide and the face of the Grand Canyon to keep him from the lady of his choice; not even her mother can do that.

They run into trouble on a cross-country automobile trip, and are rescued by Fairbanks when he converts his Ford into a railcar to cross a desert washout. At the El Tovar hotel, we meet the villainous Navajo Chin-de-dah, who lives in a secret cliff-house deep in the Grand Canyon, who leads Forrest and Marjorie to his lair with ""forced marriage"" on his mind. With the assistance of one of Chin-de-dah's henchmen, Ned Thacker descends the cliffs on a rope and effects a rescue. While the villain is a very unfortunate Indian stereotype, the footage of the Grand Canyon and Canyon de Chelly is spectacular, and taken in the spirit it was intended, this is a fun, somewhat carelessly constructed romp, and a good example of why Douglas Fairbanks was so popular. In the surviving material shown at the Buster Keaton Festival, some confusion is caused when Forrest Vandeteer's name changes to Forrest Barris part way through, probably because of a difference in the source material.

                    Ruth Tilden, the daughter of an able jurist, appears for the defense in a seemingly hopeless case in which a woman is tried for the murder of her lover. The woman had confessed her crime and the District Attorney, John Harding, is confident of a verdict for the state. By an impassioned appeal, Ruth wins. John Harding loses his case, but admiration growing into love wins the hand of Ruth. John wishes to shield Ruth from all the worry and struggles of life, and this means for Ruth the end of a career. She feels that she is only a plaything for his idle hours; a flower in a hothouse. John Harding, by a previous marriage, has a son, Jack. The boy, barely twenty years of age, has inherited a fortune from his maternal grandfather, and John allows him full liberty, believing the boy's common sense and training will prevent him from getting into serious trouble. Jack becomes entangled with a cabaret singer, Annette, who has both brains and beauty, but no morals and an evil past. The past is shared by one Raoul Bozen. Annette has spread her toils so that Jack's fortune is in her grasp, when a pistol shot ends her life. Jack is arrested, and circumstantial evidence is against him. His father is compelled to prosecute his own son. Ruth, who comes to the rescue, is retained for the defense. In a masterly cross-examination, she convicts Raoul Bozen, wins a verdict against her husband, and restores his son to him.

He has a home in Gilgal, Ill., and a wife and twelve-month-old baby at the time the story opens, in 1861. A call is received for volunteers and he joins the Northern army. His wife is a Southern girl, and she opposes his joining the Union forces. The quarrel results in a separation and Jim goes to war. Ben Merrill, an unscrupulous contractor, meets Jim's wife in Natchez, her home town, and induces her to go with him to New Orleans. She deserts her baby and goes. In New Orleans a levee contractor comes to Merrill with the proposition that they take the contract for a new levee to be built at Gilgal. Merrill accepts and leaves New Orleans without telling the woman where he is going, and she is left to take care of herself. After the war Jim returns to Natchez and finds that his wife has deserted their little boy, and no one knows where she is. He takes the boy, Little Breeches, and Banty Tim, a negro, who has saved his life during the war, and returns to Gilgal. He is welcomed by Kate Taggart, the daughter of the village storekeeper. Jim's wife yearns for her baby and returns. Jim forgives her for the child's sake. The high waters are coming on and Merrill is afraid that the levee will not hold. He plans to lay the blame on Jim and the negro. He arouses the suspicion of the townspeople against the negro and Jim is forced to fight for Banty Tim on several occasions. Merrill meets Jim's wife and induces her to loosen the sandbags and leave the water into the village. She escapes in a boat, the bottom of which has been cut by Merrill. In the middle of the stream the boat begins to sink and Banty Tim goes to her rescue. The negro is accused of breaking the levee and then escaping. Jim offers his life as a forfeit if the negro does not return by sunrise. The next day the village people are at Indian Mound, and the men are about to hang Jim because Banty Tim has not come back. Just then he comes on with Little Breeches, who tells of his rescue by the negro. A year later Jim is again engineer of the ""Prairie Belle."" In a race with another boat the engines become overheated. Merrill is aboard and Jim has him locked in the oil room. When the boat takes fire Jim goes and opens the door of the oil room and finds his son there with Merrill. While they are trying to escape the boilers explode. Jim is rescued from the debris by Banty Tim. Some time later Jim's wife having died, he and Little Breeches and Kate and Banty Tim are united in a happy family.

Later, she dies, and the boy, known as Byron Bennett, is leading man for a theatrical company playing one night stands. The season, however, has been disastrous, and the company is about to disband, when they receive word that the house is sold out for the performance at Mayville; so they hang on. However, the manager collects the receipts for the performance, and takes the first train, leaving the company stranded. Byron, who is known as Buddy, secures a position as Instructor for the Jessup Volunteer Hose Company which is to give an amateur theatrical performance. He persuades Grace Jessup's father to allow her to take the leading part in order to out-do Hose Company No. 1, which also plans a performance. Grace becomes interested in Percy Pennington, a traveling salesman. He tries to persuade her to elope, but she refuses until he makes a definite promise of marriage. He boasts, however, to Buddy and his friend, Skinny, and intimates that the promise will not be carried out. Soon after, he starts out riding with Grace. Buddy is suspicious and follows on a bicycle, but is outdistanced. At last, however, he sees the horse tied by the roadside, and hears Grace scream. Rushing to her assistance he overcomes Percy, and carries Grace home, in a fainting condition. Col. Jessup, thinking Bud is the culprit, fires at him twice. One bullet lodges in the shoulder, while the other is stopped by Buddy's watch in which he carries a picture of his mother. Grace regains consciousness and explains matters; and Jessup is amazed to find the picture in the watch is that of his wife. The doctor advises that Buddy will recover, and there is a reconciliation between father, son and daughter.
