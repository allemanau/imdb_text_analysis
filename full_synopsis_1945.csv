                    Don Birnam, long-time alcoholic, has been ""on the wagon"" for ten days and seems to be over the worst; but his craving has just become more insidious. Evading a country weekend planned by his brother Wick and girlfriend Helen, he begins a four-day bender. In flashbacks we see past events, all gone wrong because of the bottle. But this bout looks like being his last...one way or the other.

                    An alcoholic spends a weekend alone with only his bottle for company. Don Burnam is a less than successful writer who shares an apartment with his brother Wick. He quit college midway through after selling a story to a major magazine but found that success would elude him. He turned to drink and now finds himself going on regular binges. He's supposed to go away with Wick for the weekend but having found $10 meant for their cleaning lady, soon finds himself at the local liquor store and his favorite bar. He reminisces with the bartender and anyone who will listen about his life and particularly about Helen St. James who he met at the opera and who loves him dearly, despite his illness. His weekend binge gets him into the drunk ward at the hospital and once home, contemplates suicide.

                    Don Birnam is an alcoholic. His brother Wick and girlfriend Helen know but believe that he is on the wagon, a belief he does his best not to shatter. They try to keep him sober and healthy by arranging trips and other such events. One is this weekend - Don and Wick are heading to the country. However, Don manages to delay the trip and then evade it altogether, in order to get drunk in a bar. He has no money, so often ends up getting his alcohol by more and more outlandish and nefarious means. He does have two things going for him: Helen loves him and will do anything to see him shake his addiction. The other is that he has a great talent for writing, and has great ambition in that regard. However, his productivity as a writer is undermined by his alcoholism, creating a downward spiral of despair and addiction. Sensing his own plight, his thoughts turn darker.

"2","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037515/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Ten people are gathered for a long weekend on an island off the coast of Devon, England. They are the guests of the mysterious Mr. and Mrs. U.N. Owen, whom none of the ten has ever actually met. During dinner, they notice the centerpiece of ten china Indian figurines, and they compare it to the nursery rhyme counting down from ten to none. After dinner, a recording suddenly blares through the room, accusing them each of the death of another person or persons. Judge Quincannon is accused of sentencing to death an innocent man named Edward Seton. Dr. Armstrong is accused of operating on a woman while drunk and causing her death. Lombard, an adventurer, is accused of allowing a group of native people to be massacred in Africa. Vera Claythorne is accused of the death of her sister's fiance. Nikki Starloff is accused of running over two people with his car. General Mandrake is accused of sending his wife's lover to be killed in the war. Miss Emily Brent is accused of causing the death of a young man by driving him to suicide. The Rogerses are accused of helping the old lady they took care of to die a little sooner than she should have so that they would inherit her money. The voice promises them justice. After this recording, the startled guests compare notes and discover they've been lured to the island under somewhat false pretenses, and they further discover that they are totally cut off from the mainland until the weekend is over. Prince Nikita Starloff suddenly chokes on his drink and dies. Nobody likes to suggest murder, but he doesn't seem the type to suddenly commit suicide. The hysterical Mrs. Rogers is given a sedative by Dr. Armstrong and her husband and the doctor get her to bed. But in the morning she is found dead. The eight remaining people make the connection from the two deaths to the nursery rhyme: ""Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight."" They search the island for ""Mr. Owen."" They find they are alone, and they figure one of their number is a murderer. They begin to compare stories and admit their levels of guilt. The next to die is the General, who is found dead of a knife wound down by the seashore (Eight little Indian boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were seven). Each time one of the people is murdered, they find another statue gone from the centerpiece. They think Rogers is the most likely candidate for the murderer, so they make him sleep out in the woodshed. But Rogers is found dead of an ax wound to the head in the morning, and Miss Brent is missing--she is discovered walking alone down on the seashore. They want to accuse her, but while they are running around in some confusion, she is killed with a hypodermic (Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six. Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five). Now the remaining five realize they need to keep together in groups. They tell a little more of the truth of themselves, except Vera won't admit any guilt. While Vera, Lombard, and Blore realize that three is the safest number, the judge and the doctor agree they can form an alliance and find out the truth themselves. When the judge dies from a gunshot wound to the head next, only the doctor examines him and makes that declaration (Five little Indian boys going in for law; One got into Chancery and then there were four). Then with all the electricity gone from the house, in the darkness the remaining four lose the doctor (Four little Indian boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three--he's been drowned down on the seashore), and while Vera, Lombard, and Blore get ready to go look, Blore is killed by someone pushing a piece of chimney down on him (Three little Indian boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two). Lombard and Vera are alone together, and they suspect each other. But they also feel a definite attraction to each other, and they end up agreeing that they don't really think the other is guilty. Vera pretends to shoot Lombard on the beach, and he falls as if dead (Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one). Vera goes back up to the house and discovers there's a hangman's noose waiting for her to use it (One little Indian boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none). The judge is sitting in a chair, alive, and explains his plot to her. He thinks he knows that each person is guilty and that the law cannot touch them, so his plan has been to execute them all and then commit suicide. He tells Vera that if the police arrive and find nine dead bodies, they will hang her for murder, so she may as well hang herself. He drinks a glass of poison, but Vera and Lombard, who is actually not Lombard but an innocent friend of Lombard's, are left alive and in each other's arms.","

                    Seven guests are invited by Mr. and Mrs. U.N. Owen, most indirectly, to their estate, the only thing located on remote English coastal Indian Island, to which there is only boat access twice a week. The only other people on the island and estate are the two married domestics, who are already there, and Mrs. Owen's new secretary, who accompanies the other seven on the boat. In addition to the name of the island, there are references to the nursery rhyme Ten Little Indians throughout the estate, including a collection of ten Indian statues on the dining room table. All ten people at the estate will quickly learn three things: that neither Mr. or Mrs. Owen are yet there, they being delayed in London; that none of them have ever met either of the Owens, even the three employees, or know each other beyond the married couple knowing each other; and that Owen accuses all ten of being responsible for the death of an innocent person, and thus must pay for their crime. The accusations are on the surface surprising as the guests include highly respected people, such as a judge, a doctor and a former general. The ten are stuck on the island for at least three days until the next boat arrives as there is no means of communication otherwise on or off the island. As per the nursery rhyme, the guests, one by one, are found dead, each time with one of the ten Indian statues on the dining room table missing. Initially, those still alive believe U.N. Owen, which they realize is a play on the word ""unknown"", is hiding somewhere on the island, committing the murders himself. But what may be more frightening for them is the possibility that Owen may be one of the ten of them, and thus has a front row seat to their every move...

                    On a remote and isolated island, ten people - 8 invited guests and two servants - find themselves facing their own deaths. Their unidentified host informs them, via a gramophone record, that as they have all been responsible for someone's death, they in turn will die before the weekend is out. There is no way for any of them to flee the island, so they set about trying to determine who their hidden host might be and where he might be hiding. One by one, the guests are killed and one of them suggests that the killer is likely among them.

They get her to a doctor, but he is unable to save her. A grief-stricken Mildred puts every ounce of her energy into her restaurant, which quickly becomes successful. Her divorce comes through, and she and Bert part on good terms. Mildred uses her new found wealth to open more restaurants, and to shower Veda with luxurious gifts. Veda grows more and more spoiled and ungrateful, and enters into a relationship with a wealthy young man. Monte, meanwhile, has been using large amounts of Mildred's money to furnish his own playboy lifestyle, and also becoming strangely close with Veda. Mildred leaves him, but gives him a large sum in compensation.Veda claims that she had eloped with Teddy Forrester, a young man from a wealthy family, though she admits to not loving him. Teddy's mother insists they annul the marriage and Mildred agrees, though she does not care for Mrs. Forrester's snobbish attitude. At the lawyer's office, the Pierce's are about to be denied a $10,000 settlement for the annulment, due to Mildred's wealth. To secure the payment for herself, Veda claims that she is pregnant. When she arrives home, she gloats to her mother that her pregnancy was a lie, and that she now has the money to leave home forever. Mildred rips up the check. Veda slaps her, and is turned out of the house.Mildred, deeply hurt and conflicted by Veda's actions, lives in Mexico for several years before returning home to California. She meets with Bert and asks after Veda. He takes her to Wally Fay's bar, where she now performs as a lounge singer. Mildred reunites with her and begs her to come home, but Veda insults her further and claims that she wants the life Monte had described to her years ago. Mildred leaves, determined to win her daughter back. She visits Monte, and asks him to marry her. He agrees, in exchange for ownership of a third of Mildred's restaurant stock.Bert visits Mildred after her wedding, and she admits she does not love Monte, but will do anything to bring Veda home. Bert reveals that Veda has agreed to return, and she shares a tearful reunion with her mother, promising to change her spoiled ways.During a lavish birthday party for Veda, Mildred is held up at the office discussing the financial toll her business has taken, due to Monte's scheming dealings. When Mildred arrives home, she is told that Monte and Veda have gone to Monte's beach house. Mildred follows them there, and discovers them kissing. Veda again acts entitled and cruel to her mother, boasting that Monte had only stayed with Mildred to have access to her daughter, and that they will soon marry. Mildred, incredibly hurt, leaves the house. Monte then rejects Veda's advances, saying he never loved her, and calling her ""a rotten little tramp."" A livid Veda pulls a revolver (belonging to her father) and shoots him dead. He gasps Mildred's name before collapsing.Mildred returns to the house after hearing the shots. Veda admits to killing Monte, and begs her mother to cover for her and provide her with money and time to escape. Knowing she can provide nothing more for Veda, Mildred calls the police. At the station, as Mildred finishes her interrogation, Veda is led in. After prompting from the police and further evidence, it is admitted that Veda is the true killer. She is calmly led to jail as Mildred weeps. Free to go, Mildred leaves the station, where she meets Bert. They walk away together, leaving their past behind.

She is only interested in her work. The head of the institution, the elderly Dr. Murchison (Leo G. Carroll) is retiring, involuntarily. He had had an episode of nervous exhaustion from overwork, and the board had decided that this could happen again and he needed to retire. He is to be replaced by the renowned young Dr. Edwardes, who has published an acclaimed book about guilt complexes.Dr. Edwardes (Gregory Peck) arrives. There is immediate magnetism between him and Dr. Peterson. But some disturbing developments occur. At dinner on the first evening, he has a bizarre and inappropriate outburst upon seeing Dr. Peterson draw the outline of a proposed swimming pool, using the tines of her fork, on a linen napkin.As the days go by, the friendship between Drs. Edwardes and Peterson grows closer. She goes to his room late one evening, and they declare their love for each other. But while they are embracing, he has another bizarre reaction upon seeing the parallel stripes on her white robe. Then he receives a phone call. One of the patients has become very agitated and tried to cut his throat; he is in surgery. Drs. Edwardes and Peterson go there. Dr. Edwardes has a serious panic attack in the operating room. He is taken to his own room. While Dr. Peterson is watching over him, she notices that his autograph in a copy of his book, which she has borrowed from the library, is very different from the signature on a note that he had written to her. This person is not Dr. Edwardes.When he wakes up, Dr. Peterson confronts him. He says that he does not know who he is. He killed the real Dr. Edwardes, and is taking his place. He has complete amnesia. His only connection to reality is that he has a cigarette case with the monogram ""J.B."". She says that she trusts him completely, and will help him. The police will not come immediately, and she may be able to straighten out the mystery. He should sleep, and she will report in the morning that he is too ill for work. But during the night, he writes her a letter saying that he can't involve her in this, because he loves her. He is going to the Empire State Hotel in New York. He slips the note under her door and disappears.The next morning, the police have arrived. They were tipped off by the real Dr. Edwardes' secretary, saying that when she had telephoned him at Green Manors, she didn't recognize his voice. They show his photograph to the staff, and they all agree that that isn't the ""Dr. Edwardes"" that they know. ""Dr. Edwardes"" is of course missing. They go to see Dr. Peterson in her room. She says that she left Dr. Edwardes in his own room, and that he was too agitated to say anything sensible. She also notices the letter on the floor near her door, but is too frightened to pick it up while the others are present. The police and other staff members leave. Dr. Murchison is the last to leave, and, seeing the letter on the floor, picks it up and politely hands it to Dr. Peterson. She reads it after the others have left.The next day she goes to the hotel in New York. After managing to find out his room number by recognizing his handwriting on the hotel registration cards (he registered as ""John Brown""), she goes to his room and talks to him. She wants to use her psychoanalytic expertise to cure him of his amnesia and guilt complex. He believes that he must have killed Dr. Edwardes, taken his identity, and come to Green Manors. But she is absolutely convinced of his innocence.She notices that his left hand has been burned. He relives some kind of accident that he must have been in, but can't remember any more details. She asks him an abstruse medical question, and determines from his accurate answer that he must have been some kind of doctor. But when they find out that her name and picture are in the newspaper, they have to make a quick exit from the hotel. They go to Grand Central Station to take a train somewhere.At the station, Constance tells J.B. to free-associate when he gets to the head of the ticket line, and when the clerk ask for the destination, say the first thing that comes to his mind. He requests two tickets to Rome. Constance explains that he means Rome, Georgia. After they get their tickets, Constance realizes that a policeman saw them, and will recognize them soon, so they can't go to Georgia. They instead take a different train to Rochester, New York, home of Dr. Alex Brulov (Michael Chekhov), who was Dr. Peterson's teacher, analyst, and mentor.On the train trip, J.B. recalls that he was in the Army Medical Corps, flying over Rome, Italy, and his plane was shot down. He was burned at that time.When they arrive, Dr. Brulov is not in, but two men are present. It turns out that they are policemen, wanting to know what Dr. Brulov knows about Dr. Edwardes. Dr. Edwardes disappeared on a trip in the Cumberland Mountains with a patient of his. The elderly Dr. Brulov arrives. He is a stereotypical (complete with a beard and a German accent) old-school Freudian. He is not friendly to the policemen, and tells them that he disliked Dr. Edwardes. ""What kind of an analyst is it, who wants to cure psychosis by taking people skating? Or to a bowling alley?"" After the police leave, Constance announces that she is married, and introduces her husband John Brown. Dr. Brulov is delighted for her, though he says, in his strict old-school way ""Women make the best psychoanalysts, until they fall in love. After that, they make the best patients."" He offers to put them up in his spare bedroom, and bids them goodnight with ""Happy dreams, which we will analyze at breakfast.""In the bedroom, J.B. is concerned that, while they got past the police, Dr. Brulov might suspect something. Constance assures him that Alex is actually not very savvy in social situations. (She is wrong.) J.B. has another anxiety attack while looking at the bedspread, which is white with textured embroidery in parallel lines. Dr. Peterson realizes that parallel lines on a white background seem to be what sets off these attacks.Medical ethics, not to mention 1945 movie studio sensibilities, require that J.B. sleep on the sofa while Constance takes the bed. During the night, J.B. wakes up, realizes that he is seriously in need of a shave, and goes into the bathroom. While mixing the shaving soap, he has another episode, set off by the white color of the soap, the sink, and the bathtub. He goes downstairs, in a trance-like state, still holding a straight razor. Dr. Brulov is downstairs, having awakened in the night and gone to do some work. He offers J.B. a glass of milk. He has noticed the razor, and he secretly puts a large dose of sedative in J.B.'s milk.In the morning, Dr. Peterson comes downstairs, wondering whether J.B. has left. Dr. Brulov points to him, sleeping on the sofa. Alex and Constance then exchange sharp words. Dr. Brulov tells Constance that he knows that J.B. is quite possibly a murderer. ""The moment I see you with a husband, whose pupils are enlarged, who has a tremor of the left hand, who is on a honeymoon with no baggage, and who's name is John Brown, I know practically what is going on."" He is going to call the police. Dr. Peterson tells him that she knows he must be innocent, because ""I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad."" She couldn't love him if he were guilty. Dr. Brulov then mocks her mercilessly. ""You are twenty times crazier than him. 'She couldn't love him if he were no good.' This is baby talk."" ""We both know that the mind of a woman in love is operating on the lowest level of the intellect."" She finally persuades him to help her cure him, and hold off for a few days on calling the police.Dr. Brulov awakens J.B. and begins some rather stern therapy. J.B. has had a dream. Dr. Brulov tells him that dreams contain a window into whatever the person is trying to hide, but they are in terms of puzzle pieces that are all mixed up.What follows is the famous ""dream sequence"", designed by the renowned abstract impressionist artist Salvador Dali. The dream is full of fantastical images and psychoanalytic symbolism. J.B. is in a gambling casino, surrounded by drapes with eyes painted on them. The other patrons have blank faces. He deals the seven of clubs to a man with a beard, who says that he has 21 and has won. But the opponent's other cards are blank. Then the proprietor comes over and accuses the bearded man of cheating. He says ""This is my place, and if I catch you cheating again, I'll fix you.""In the next scene, the man with the beard is leaning over the sloping edge of a high building. J.B. yells at him to watch out, but he falls over the edge. Then the proprietor appears from behind a chimney, holding a wheel. He drops the wheel. In the next scene, J.B. is running down a slope, with a large winged creature overhead.After relating the dream, J.B. begins to have another episode. Drs. Brulov and Peterson realize that he saw the view out the window, where children are sledding in the snow, leaving parallel tracks. They realize that the phobia must have arisen from seeing ski tracks, and that he must have been skiing with Dr. Edwardes.J.B. begins to recall the ski trip. Thanks to the clue of the ""angel wings"", they piece together that the place was called Gabriel Valley. Constance convinces J.B., against much resistance, that he was traumatized by something from his childhood, and that they must go to Gabriel Valley and unlock that secret and figure out what happened to Dr. Edwardes.They go skiing, with much apprehension on the part of J.B. There is a dangerous precipice at the bottom of the hill. J.B. recalls it at the last instant, and also recalls a brief incident from his childhood. He was sliding down an outdoor banister, and accidentally knocked his brother off, causing him to be fatally impaled on a fence. He stops himself and Constance just in time. ""I didn't kill my brother. It was an accident.""His memory has returned. Back at the ski lodge, he recalls that his name is John Ballantyne. He went to Columbia Medical School, was injured in the war, and was discharged and treated for nervous shock by Dr. Edwardes. They had gone skiing, and Dr. Edwardes, who was ahead of J.B., went over the edge to his death.

"5","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037988/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) is a young man living in late-19th century London. While wealthy, charming, generally intelligent and very handsome, he is naive and easily manipulated. These faults lead to his spiral into sin and, ultimately, misery.While posing for a painting by his artist friend Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore), Dorian meets Basil's friend Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders). Wotton is enchantingly cynical and witty, and tells Dorian that the only life worth living is one dedicated entirely to pleasure. After Wotton convinces Dorian that youth and beauty will bring him everything he desires, Dorian openly wishes that his portrait could age in his place, and that he could keep his youthful good looks forever. He makes this statement in the presence of a certain Egyptian statue, which supposedly has the power to grant wishes. When the portrait of Dorian is complete, Lord Henry hails it as a masterpiece and is surprised when Basil announces he will never exhibit it because he feels he put ""too much of himself"" into it. Basil is also concerned about Lord Henry's influence on the impressionable Dorian, who Basil considers a dear friend and an artistic muse. Basil gives the painting to Dorian, who proudly hangs it in his opulent home.One fateful night, Dorian visits a lower-class tavern, The Two Turtles, where he is given a prime seat for the night's entertainment. He is instantly charmed by the tavern owners' daughter, Sibyl Vane (Angela Lansbury), who performs a sweet singing routine during the lineup. Dorian is invited backstage after the show to meet Sibyl, and plays the piano for her in the empty tavern. Sibyl is flattered by the attention of such a handsome gentleman, and her mother (Lydia Bilbrook) encourages the relationship because of Dorian's wealth, but Sibyl's brother James (Richard Fraser) is suspicious. James tells his enamored sister in private that if this young man, whom Sibyl nicknamed ""Sir Tristan"" after a virtuous knight in Arthurian mythology, ever harms her, he will kill him. James is then deployed to Australia on a sailing mission.Dorian excitedly tells Basil and Lord Henry that he is engaged to the beautiful Sibyl Vane, and invites them to come with him to the tavern to hear her sing. Despite having heard Lord Henry's disdainful views on marriage, Dorian is so genuinely happy that Lord Henry's words no longer influence him. Basil sees this as a positive development, and after seeing Sibyl perform and making her acquaintance, encourages the engagement for the sake of Dorian's moral purity. Lord Henry, on the other hand, cannot resist exploiting his innate ability to influence his friends, and suggests that Dorian test Sibyl's worth with an ""experiment."" Dorian invites Sibyl to his house that night and, when she prepares to go home, asks her to stay. Torn between love and honor, Sibyl nearly leaves, but cannot resist Dorian's charm. This meant that she had failed Lord Henry's test, and Dorian sends her an incredibly hurtful letter, accusing her of ""killing his love,"" and that she can have no part in his life henceforth. He sends her a sum of money for compensation, but Sibyl is emotionally destroyed.When Dorian returns home after abandoning Sibyl, he notices a slight change in the portrait Basil had painted of him. The mouth looks somehow crueler, and a cold unkindness is present in the face that had not been there before. When he wakes the next morning, the change is still visible. He feels immense guilt over how badly he had treated Sibyl, and hastily composes an apology letter in an attempt to redeem himself. Before he can deliver it, Lord Henry arrives with the news that Sibyl Vane had killed herself the night before. Dorian is initially devastated, but Lord Henry convinces him to not blame himself for the tragedy and invites him to the opera. Abandoning his grief, Dorian falls deeper into Lord Henry's teachings of ""new hedonism"", and goes to the opera with him that very night. Basil is surprised and worried when he witnesses Dorian's uncaring behavior in regard to Sibyl's death, and Dorian plans to dedicate his life solely to his own pleasure. Because the change in the portrait still disturbed him, Dorian has it covered with a screen and locked in his old school room at the top of the house, to which he keeps the only key.Eighteen years later, Dorian is nearing his fortieth birthday, but has not visibly changed since age twenty-two. His friends and neighbors are awestruck at his youthful appearance, but unsavory rumors constantly circulate about his strange behavior and acquaintances. Having taken Lord Henry's ideas to heart, Dorian's life consists largely of scandals with women, opium dens, and influencing other wealthy young men to adopt his hedonistic way of living. Over time, many of his friends lost their good standing in society, and women were shamed to be in his company. Dorian meets Basil again, who is preparing to catch a train to Paris, and invites him to his house. Basil expresses his concern about Dorian's behavior, and admits that in order to truly know what kind of man Dorian is, he would have to see his soul itself. Dorian grimly leads Basil up to the old school room to look upon his handiwork for the first time in eighteen years. Dorian removes the coverings from the hidden portrait, and Basil is horrified to see that the man in the painting has warped into a hideous, demon-like creature to reflect Dorian's multitude of sins. Basil begs Dorian to repent and change his ways, but Dorian feels a surge of anger toward Basil, blaming him for his miserable life because the painting was his own work. Dorian stabs Basil to death and locks his body in the school room with the horrible painting, in which blood has appeared on the hands of the twisted painted Dorian.The next morning, Dorian summons a former friend, Allen Campbell (Douglas Walton), whose reputation had since been ruined by his associations with Dorian. Campbell is a scientist specializing in anatomy and chemistry, and Dorian blackmails the highly reluctant man into disposing of Basil's body. The nature of the blackmailing subject is not revealed, but Campbell agrees to disintegrate Basil's body, and departs afterward looking shaken and disturbed.Basil's disappearance is talked about in London society for some time, but Dorian is never suspected. Among the few who have remained his loyal friends are Lord Henry and Gladys (Donna Reed), Basil's niece, who was a little girl when the portrait was painted. Dorian enters a romance with Gladys, though he is apprehensive about the effect he appears to have on the lives of those he becomes close to. He visits a seedy inn one evening and finds a former friend, Adrian Singleton (Morton Lowry), a wealthy young man who had been ruined by following Dorian's influence. Adrian is now a disheveled opium addict, but he knows of Dorian's sordid past and mockingly addresses him as ""Sir Tristan"" as Dorian departs the inn. The nickname is overheard by James Vane, Sibyl's brother, who happened to be at the inn and had spent eighteen years being hell-bent on avenging his sister. Though he did not know her cruel suitor's name and had never seen his face, the name ""Sir Tristan"" is enough to motivate him to follow Dorian outside and threaten him. Dorian calmly denies ever knowing a Sibyl Vane, and asserts that he is too young to have had anything to do with a death that occurred eighteen years before. James Vane admits that this man looks too young to be the suspect, and releases him. Adrian Singleton, with both amusement and resentment, explains to James that Dorian Gray was the man he sought, and that he had not looked a day older than twenty-two for the past eighteen years. Enraged, James Vane begins to track down Dorian Gray.A few days later, Dorian attends a hunting party with several society friends. The sport is interrupted when a man, assumed to be a beater, is shot to death by accident after hiding in the bushes unseen. It is revealed to Dorian later that the dead man was not a beater, but James Vane, having followed Dorian in revenge and lost his own life in the process. Dorian feels even more guilty and cursed, but wishes to make one final stab at having a good and worthwhile life. He soon proposes marriage to Gladys, who happily accepts, much to the displeasure of her friend David Stone (Peter Lawford), who is one of the many who are suspicious of Dorian.Despite his happiness about his upcoming marriage to Gladys, Dorian is weighted down by the deaths of Sibyl, Basil, and James, as well as the ruin of Adrian Singleton and others like him. The last straw is the news that Allen Campbell, whom Dorian ruined and then blackmailed into disposing of Basil's body, had killed himself in misery. Dorian realizes that the one noble thing he can possibly do is to spare Gladys from the certain misfortune he will bring her.At long last, Dorian ventures up to the school room to face the painting that is the embodiment of his corrupted soul. Using the same knife with which he had murdered Basil Hallward, he stabs his painted figure through the heart. Dorian himself feels the effect of the knife, and collapses, praying for his salvation. Roused by his screams, his houseguests, including Gladys, David, and Lord Henry, rush upstairs and find Dorian Gray's dead body on the school room floor, now in the form of the hideous creature from the painting. The painting itself, with the knife still protruding from it, has reverted to its original image of the handsome, innocent youth than Dorian once was. Lord Henry, stricken, sees the horrible results of his own influence and gazes at Dorian's corpse in shocked remorse.","

    Synopsis
    Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) is a young man living in late-19th century London. While wealthy, charming, generally intelligent and very handsome, he is naive and easily manipulated. These faults lead to his spiral into sin and, ultimately, misery.While posing for a painting by his artist friend Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore), Dorian meets Basil's friend Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders). Wotton is enchantingly cynical and witty, and tells Dorian that the only life worth living is one dedicated entirely to pleasure. After Wotton convinces Dorian that youth and beauty will bring him everything he desires, Dorian openly wishes that his portrait could age in his place, and that he could keep his youthful good looks forever. He makes this statement in the presence of a certain Egyptian statue, which supposedly has the power to grant wishes. When the portrait of Dorian is complete, Lord Henry hails it as a masterpiece and is surprised when Basil announces he will never exhibit it because he feels he put ""too much of himself"" into it. Basil is also concerned about Lord Henry's influence on the impressionable Dorian, who Basil considers a dear friend and an artistic muse. Basil gives the painting to Dorian, who proudly hangs it in his opulent home.One fateful night, Dorian visits a lower-class tavern, The Two Turtles, where he is given a prime seat for the night's entertainment. He is instantly charmed by the tavern owners' daughter, Sibyl Vane (Angela Lansbury), who performs a sweet singing routine during the lineup. Dorian is invited backstage after the show to meet Sibyl, and plays the piano for her in the empty tavern. Sibyl is flattered by the attention of such a handsome gentleman, and her mother (Lydia Bilbrook) encourages the relationship because of Dorian's wealth, but Sibyl's brother James (Richard Fraser) is suspicious. James tells his enamored sister in private that if this young man, whom Sibyl nicknamed ""Sir Tristan"" after a virtuous knight in Arthurian mythology, ever harms her, he will kill him. James is then deployed to Australia on a sailing mission.Dorian excitedly tells Basil and Lord Henry that he is engaged to the beautiful Sibyl Vane, and invites them to come with him to the tavern to hear her sing.

                    Walter Craig, an architect, is summoned down to a house called Pilgrim's Farm by a prospective client whom he does not know. On arrival he experiences strongly the feeling that he has been to the place before. He is taken into the house and introduced by his host to a group of people. These also are familiar, though none of them appear to know him. After somewhat constrained greetings he tells them that he has met them all, and the house, and the situation, is a recurring dream. He explains how this dream always starts quietly and pleasantly - at the present moment - but after a certain small incident invariably begins to darken into ghastly nightmare, culminating in horror - a horror of his own creation - from which he wakes up sweating with fear. He never remembers his dream for more than a few moments after waking, until the next time it occurs. He then describes the incident which will mark the turning point of his dream - the breaking of a pair of glasses belonging to one of the party, a psychiatrist. Increasingly fascinated, the party one by one reveal that each has at some time undergone an ""inexplicable"" experience. The narration of these make up the body of the film.

Foley introduces him to the psychiatrist Dr. Van Straaten, his friend Joan Cortland, his young neighbor Sally O'Hara and the race car driver Hugh Grainger. Craig says that he has the sensation of Déjà vu since he had had a nightmare with them in that house but one lady is missing. However Mrs. Foley arrives, completing the characters of his dream. The skeptical Dr. Van Straaten does not believe in the supernatural but the guests describe supernatural events that they have lived. Grainger had a car accident and then a premonition that saved his life; Sally had met a ghost during Christmas; Eliot and his wife had lived an evil experience with a haunted mirror; two golfers loved the same woman and decide to win her in a game, but one of them dies and haunts the other; and Dr. Van Straaten tells the story of a ventriloquist with double personality that is dominated by his dummy. But when Dr. Van Straaten accidentally breaks his glasses and the power goes out, the nightmare continues.

                    Elizabeth Lane is the perfect homemaker in so many ways. She's an outstanding cook and interior decorator who lives in a beautiful house in the countryside, is happily married and recently had a baby - as her regular column in Smart Housekeeping magazine recounts to her wide readership. There's only one big catch: she isn't any of those things - she can't cook, doesn't know the first thing about decorating and lives in a tiny, dingy apartment. It all begins to unravel when her publisher, Alexander Yardley, arranges for recently rescued sailor Jefferson Jones to spend the weekend at Lane's country home. To top it off, Yardley invites himself to spend the weekend there as well. Elizabeth scrambles, getting her friend Felix Bassenak to cook for her and borrows her friend John Sloan's country house. She even gets a baby from a neighbor. As if she doesn't have enough to deal with, she and Jones become quite attracted to one another. Somehow it all works out in the end.

                    Featured in Smart Housekeeping magazine, domestic goddess Elizabeth Lane's column, which focuses primarily on food and which is the most popular column of its kind in the country, is an account of her perfect domestic life as wife and new mother living on a rural Connecticut property. However, it is all a sham as Liz is single, lives in a small New York City apartment, and doesn't know how to cook, she using her Uncle Fritz Bassenak, a chef and restaurateur, as her source for the food items, and her long time suitor, architect John Sloan, who owns a Connecticut farm, as the source of the stories of rural Connecticut life. A problem arises for Liz and by association her editor, Dudley Beecham, who knows the truth about Liz, when their publisher, Alexander Yardley, who values truth above all else, asks Liz to host a Connecticut Christmas dinner for himself and war hero Jefferson Jones. Jeff is one of the few survivors of a bombed destroyer. Spending eighteen days on a life raft, he dreamed more about good food than anything during those eighteen days. His naval hospital nurse, Mary Lee, who he feigned to love just to get that food against doctor's orders, believes that Jeff, who has never had a supportive home life, has to experience such to get him to marry her, which resulted in the request to Liz via Yardley. It isn't until after Liz agrees to marry John, who she does not love but can no longer use the excuse of her flourishing writing career not to marry as she is sure Yardley will fire her once he knows the truth, that Dudley comes up with the idea to use John's Connecticut house and Felix's behind the scenes cooking prowess to host that Christmas dinner in Connecticut, complete with a borrowed baby. All the parties in the know agree. Complications ensue when Liz, John and Felix try to keep the truth from Jeff and Yardley, that truth which includes Judge Crowthers, who is to officiate Liz and John's wedding and who they have to hide physically whenever he is at the farm in order to marry them. But the biggest complication is that Liz and Jeff fall in love at first sight, Jeff whose love may wane if he learns that Liz is not all she appears on the surface.

Robinson) is a lonely cashier married to a nagging widow Adele (Rosalind Ivan). Painting is the only thing that brings him joy. After a party celebrating his 25 years on the job, he sees Kitty (Joan Bennett), a comely young woman, being accosted by Johnny (Dan Duryea). Chris knocks Johnny out. Later Kitty gets Chris to open up to her and Chris admits that he paints pictures. Kitty assumes he is a highly paid artist because he seems so knowledgeable yet humble. Johnny and Kitty, it turns out are partners and Johnny talks Kitty into extorting money from Chris. Chris, a cashier, sees his relationship with Kitty in idolized and romantic terms, unable to see her as the grafter she is. He sets up Kitty in an apartment and keep his paintings there as a studio, but to obtain funds he embezzles money from the company he works for. When Janeway (Jess Barker), an influential art dealer discovers Chris's canvasses, he is told Kitty is the creator, and Johnny facilitates and encourages the collusion. When Adele's first husband (Charles Kemper) turns up alive, an ex-police detective taken for dead in the line of duty, Chris sees a way out and sets up the ex-cop to reunite with his wife. Chris sees this as a way to go to Kitty permanently but discovering her in the arms of Johnny, Chris does something impulsive, and his future days are affected by his actions in the most dramatic ways.LONGER VERSIONChris Cross, (Edward G. Robinson), has worked as a cashier for a brokerage house for 25 years. At a party honoring him, Chris is given an engraved gold pocket watch studded by diamonds by his boss J.. J. Hogarth (Russell Hicks), for his loyal and dedicated service for the firm.We learn that Chris may be superstitious when Chris's boss lights his cigar as the third on the same match, and a quick aside shows him crossing his fingers to ward off evil.The boss leaves the party early, and is seen getting into a car with a gorgeous young blonde. This triggers envious comments from Chris and fellow employees.On his way home Chris sees a man beating a young woman Kitty March (Joan Bennett) and runs to her rescue, knocking the drunk assailant down with his umbrella. Kitty insists on getting away without calling police, so Chris escorts Kitty back to her apartment. They stop at a bar for drinks, where they chat.After she sees the diamond studded gold watch, and because he was well dressed for the party, when Chris modestly tells Kitty that he paints for fun, she assumes that he is a wealthy artist. Chris enjoys her admiration and is too embarrassed to tell her that he's only a cashier. He talks eloquently about how he creates a painting, sometimes in one day, sometimes in a year, in a way that confirms her notion that his paintings could sell for hundreds of dollars in the art market, maybe up to fifty thousand. As they part at the door to her building, he shyly asks for her phone number. She says she has no phone and he says he will write.The next day, a friend from work comes to visit Chris, and his horrid domestic life, ruled by a bullying wife Adele (Rosalind Ivan), is revealed. Adele idolizes her late husband, a policeman drowned while trying to save a woman, and constantly complains that Chris is less. He must pursue his hobby in the bathroom, out of sight from Adele, and he must also put on an apron to clean the kitchen even after his friends arrival. Adele complains Chris is too stingy to buy her a radio, so she must go downstairs to listen to ""The Happy Family Hour,"" while Robinson sits at the dinner table and buries his head in his hands. He acts like a meek servant both at home and at work, where he spends hours inside a cashier's cage.At her apartment a few days later, when a letter from Chris arrives, also learnthat the attacker was Johnny, Kitty's violent boyfriend Johnny Prince (Dan Duryea), with whom she was arguing over money. Johnny convinces Kitty to pursue a relationship with Chris, in order to extort money from him. Johnny has a habit of smacking her around and is also a con artist. We learn that Kitty is a lazy slob as she flips her cigarette butt into a sink piled high with dirty dishes.Soon, Chris becomes enamored of her. He believes that Kitty is an actress and that Johnny is the boyfriend of Kitty's ex-roommate. Kitty also sees in the love-sick Chris a real patsy who may have loads of cash that she can dip into. With a sob story, Kitty inveigles Chris to give her money to rent an apartment, one that can also be his art studio. Kitty and Johnny take a fancy apartment in Greenwich Village formerly used by Mexican mural painter Diego Rivera.To finance this, Chris takes cash from his cashiers box. He also locates bonds that Adele got from her late husbands life insurance. Chris has a big problem in Adele, who is more like a jailer than a wife to him. Adele berates Chris constantly, and hates the very sight of the many paintings in their apartment, threatening to give them to the junk-man. Chris moves all his paintings to the studio.Chris eventually steals $1,200.00 to give to Kitty. Johnny, who gambles, soon gets the idea of selling Chris' paintings for cash. He takes two to a street painter in Greenwich Village, who criticizes the work for incorrect perspective but agrees to sell them for $25.00 apiece. To his surprise Johnny finds out that famous art expert and columnist David Janeway (Jess Balker) has bought them and is completely agog over the paintings, and says they might bring as much as $5000.00. He convinces Kitty that Chris is a goose that lays golden eggs with the comment ""He's too dumb to be a phony"".Janeway is so taken with the paintings that he tails Johnny to the apartment accompanied by art dealer Dellarowe. He says he can get high prices for the paintings but must meet the painter in person. Johnny quickly says Kitty painted them. Kitty goes along after a private conversation in which Johnny tells her since she wanted to be an actress, now was the time to prove herself.Kitty charms the critic by repeating words she heard from Chris in their first chat at the bar. Janeway promises to represent her, and soon her paintings are on display at the exclusive Dellarowe Art Galley. Dellarowe arranges for exhibitions and Kitty quickly becomes a much sought after modern artist.Meantime, Chris has no idea of what's been happening to his paintings. Kitty orders him around viciously, getting him to paint her toenails, demanding that he paint more and more. But he is so amazed at having a young pretty woman tell him that he is loved, that just to bask in her presence is enough.He paints a portrait of Kitty to be passed off as a self portrait. Critic Janeway describes it as a Mona Lisa without the smile. [ASIDE: It much resembles a self portrait by Frida Kahlo, wife of Diego Rivera, who commands astronomical prices sixty years later] Johnny pushes Kitty to take up a relationship with Janeway as well as Chris.One afternoon Adele sees in the window of the ritzy Dellarowe Art Gallery paintings she recognizes, selling for $500, with Kitty March's name on them. Adele rushes home to berate Chris for being a copycat with no talent, browbeating him while he is wearing a woman's ruffled apron and has a sharp knife from cutting liver pointed at his terrific nag of a wife. The way he stabs the knife on the cutting board suggests he imagines stabbing Adele.Chris goes to the studio apartment to find out that many of his painting are gone. Still Chris forgives Kitty for selling them and even gives her credit for them being as valuable and famous as they are because of her looks. Chris grasps that he can sell his paintings under Kitty's signature, and happily lets her be the public face of his art.Meanwhile Adele's first husband detective Sgt. Higgins (Charles Kemper) reappears and seeks Chris out. He explains he had not drowned, but had stolen money from the woman he supposedly was saving. He faked being dead for years before to keep from going to jail for police corruption. He wants Chris to pay him off to keep quiet, and not ruin his marriage to Adele. Higgins doesn't realize that Chris doesnt want to save his marriage to Adele, and much prefers that his marriage should be invalidated when he confronts his wife with her live former husband.Chris tricks Higgins into coming to the apartment using Adeles life insurance bonds as bait, and exposes his fake death.Free from Adele, Chris goes to the apartment to tell Kitty her the good news and to propose marriage, only to see her passionately kissing Johnny.Shocked, he waits for Johnny to leave, and as he enters, Kitty says ""Johnny?"" out loud before she sees him. Chris confronts Kitty, but still wants her to marry him. She taunts him in reply, telling him that he is a jerk and unattractive moron who is too stupid to know it for himself.Furious, Chris loses control, then attacks and stabs Kitty multiple times with an icepick.Johnny is accused, convicted, for Kitty's murder, despite his attempts to implicate Chris, who goes unpunished. At the trial, Chris insists he copied Kittys pictures. Johnny screams ""For cat's sake, he's lying"" to no avail. With this lie, Chris callously allows the cocky boyfriend to be condemned to die. A neighbor had testified to have heard Kitty say Johnny! just as someone entered the apartment just before the stabbing.Meantime Chris's embezzlement is discovered and although the boss decides not to press charges, Chris is fired. With tears in his eyes and a look of profound shame and defeat on his face, he leaves the workplace.Posthumously, Katherine March is recognized as a great artist.On the day of Johnny's execution, Chris is riding a commuter train and hears some newsmen, on their way to Sing Sing to witness the execution, discuss the case and the criminal mind. In their theory even unpunished murderers eventually self destruct because of constant fear of discovery and their guilt, as there is a higher power that makes up for mistakes in human justice.At the hour of the execution, Chris, in his flat, haunted by thoughts of Kitty and the realization he has murdered two people, goes beserl and attempts to hang himself. He is rescued, tries to confess but is assumed to be crazy, and becomes a poor man with no way of claiming credit for his paintings. He is constantly haunted by hearing the voices of Kitty and Johnny, together for eternity, loving each other. The guilt and torment leaves Chris a cold, soulless figure prowling the squalid streets of the city, forever a prisoner of his conscience.","

But he is so amazed at having a young pretty woman tell him that he is loved, that just to bask in her presence is enough.He paints a portrait of Kitty to be passed off as a self portrait. Critic Janeway describes it as a Mona Lisa without the smile. [ASIDE: It much resembles a self portrait by Frida Kahlo, wife of Diego Rivera, who commands astronomical prices sixty years later] Johnny pushes Kitty to take up a relationship with Janeway as well as Chris.One afternoon Adele sees in the window of the ritzy Dellarowe Art Gallery paintings she recognizes, selling for $500, with Kitty March's name on them. Adele rushes home to berate Chris for being a copycat with no talent, browbeating him while he is wearing a woman's ruffled apron and has a sharp knife from cutting liver pointed at his terrific nag of a wife. The way he stabs the knife on the cutting board suggests he imagines stabbing Adele.Chris goes to the studio apartment to find out that many of his painting are gone. Still Chris forgives Kitty for selling them and even gives her credit for them being as valuable and famous as they are because of her looks. Chris grasps that he can sell his paintings under Kitty's signature, and happily lets her be the public face of his art.Meanwhile Adele's first husband detective Sgt. Higgins (Charles Kemper) reappears and seeks Chris out. He explains he had not drowned, but had stolen money from the woman he supposedly was saving. He faked being dead for years before to keep from going to jail for police corruption. He wants Chris to pay him off to keep quiet, and not ruin his marriage to Adele. Higgins doesn't realize that Chris doesnt want to save his marriage to Adele, and much prefers that his marriage should be invalidated when he confronts his wife with her live former husband.Chris tricks Higgins into coming to the apartment using Adeles life insurance bonds as bait, and exposes his fake death.Free from Adele, Chris goes to the apartment to tell Kitty her the good news and to propose marriage, only to see her passionately kissing Johnny.Shocked, he waits for Johnny to leave, and as he enters, Kitty says ""Johnny?"" out loud before she sees him. Chris confronts Kitty, but still wants her to marry him. She taunts him in reply, telling him that he is a jerk and unattractive moron who is too stupid to know it for himself.Furious, Chris loses control, then attacks and stabs Kitty multiple times with an icepick.Johnny is accused, convicted, for Kitty's murder, despite his attempts to implicate Chris, who goes unpunished. At the trial, Chris insists he copied Kittys pictures. Johnny screams ""For cat's sake, he's lying"" to no avail. With this lie, Chris callously allows the cocky boyfriend to be condemned to die. A neighbor had testified to have heard Kitty say Johnny! just as someone entered the apartment just before the stabbing.Meantime Chris's embezzlement is discovered and although the boss decides not to press charges, Chris is fired. With tears in his eyes and a look of profound shame and defeat on his face, he leaves the workplace.Posthumously, Katherine March is recognized as a great artist.On the day of Johnny's execution, Chris is riding a commuter train and hears some newsmen, on their way to Sing Sing to witness the execution, discuss the case and the criminal mind. In their theory even unpunished murderers eventually self destruct because of constant fear of discovery and their guilt, as there is a higher power that makes up for mistakes in human justice.At the hour of the execution, Chris, in his flat, haunted by thoughts of Kitty and the realization he has murdered two people, goes beserl and attempts to hang himself. He is rescued, tries to confess but is assumed to be crazy, and becomes a poor man with no way of claiming credit for his paintings. He is constantly haunted by hearing the voices of Kitty and Johnny, together for eternity, loving each other. The guilt and torment leaves Chris a cold, soulless figure prowling the squalid streets of the city, forever a prisoner of his conscience.

                    The location: Nazi occupied Rome. As Rome is classified an open city, most Romans can wander the streets without fear of the city being bombed or them being killed in the process. But life for Romans is still difficult with the Nazi occupation as there is a curfew, basic foods are rationed, and the Nazis are still searching for those working for the resistance and will go to any length to quash those in the resistance and anyone providing them with assistance. War worn widowed mother Pina is about to get married to her next door neighbor Francesco. Despite their situation - Pina being pregnant, and Francesco being an atheist - Pina and Francesco will be wed by Catholic priest Don Pietro Pelligrini. The day before the wedding, Francesco's friend, Giorgio Manfredi, who Pina has never met, comes looking for Francesco as he, working for the resistance, needs a place to hide out. For his latest mission, Giorgio also requests the assistance of Don Pietro, who is more than willing as he sees such work as being in the name of God. Don Pietro's position also provides him with access to where others are not able. Giorgio's girlfriend, Marina, a cabaret performer, doesn't even know where Giorgio is in hiding. Both Pina and Marina take measures to improve their lives under this difficult situation, those actions in combination which have tragic consequences.

A trip to the basement shows that Dracula has already taken the liberty of moving in - there's his coffin, filled with the dirt from his own grave.

He's as green as you would expect but finds his commanding officer, Flt. Lt. David Archdale to be understanding and supportive. He soon becomes a full-fledged member of the squadron, becoming a more than capable pilot and enjoying the camaraderie that comes from men who face death together. He also becomes interested in a young woman, Iris Winterton, who lives at the local hotel with her somewhat strict maiden aunt. Archdale gets married to the hotel's manageress, but tragedy strikes when he is killed in an air raid. As a result, Penrose isn't sure he wants to make a commitment to Iris. Over the years, there are many changes. The American Air Corps arrives in 1942 with the inevitable clash of cultures and Penrose is taken off flying duties to become a controller. David Archdale's widow forms a close friendship with one of the Americans and by 1944, the tide turns in favor of the allies leaving Penrose to reevaluate his feelings.

Their Hollywood stay takes a detour when they are commandeered by the police who want them to assist in getting an infant boy home, he who ran away to join the navy. The boy is orphaned Donald Martin, whose father was a naval officer killed in battle, and who now lives with his single Aunt Susie, Susan Abbott. Susan works as a movie extra, but she really wants to become a singer in films, she not yet given a break. Upon meeting Susan, Clarence decides she is the girl he wants. Joe reluctantly helps Clarence as he himself tries to connect with Lola, which is more difficult than Joe had hoped. When Susan states that she'd love to work under Iturbi, Joe comes up with the idea that Clarence can impress her by saying that he has set up an audition for her with Iturbi. That may be a difficult task as they have not met with Iturbi, who probably does not even remember them. As Joe and Clarence get into one misadventure after another in trying to track down and meet Iturbi who is probably locked behind the walls of the movie studio, they and Susan get a clearer picture of what they want for their romantic lives, more specifically who.

                    Novelist Richard Harland and socialite Ellen Berent meet on a train to New Mexico. They are immediately attracted to each other, soon fall in love and decide to get married, about which everyone they know is happy except Ellen's fiancé back home, politician Russell Quinton. However, Richard and Ellen's love for each other is different than that of the other as Ellen demonstrates in the manner which she tells everyone of their impending marriage. Ellen's love for Richard is an obsessive, possessive one, much like the love she had for her now deceased father, who Richard physically resembles. Ellen wants Richard all to herself and resents anyone who even remotely takes a place in his life and heart, even if his love for that person is not a romantic one. These people include most specifically Richard's physically disabled teen-aged brother Danny Harland, Ellen's own adopted sister Ruth Berent, and a young man neither has gotten a chance to really know yet. After time, Richard learns to what extent Ellen will go to get what she wants, she who always wins.

                    From a middle class background, twenty-five year old Joan Webster has always known what she has wanted and has taken steps to achieve that. Primary is wanting to have the finer things in life, and as such she has accepted the marriage proposal of wealthy and much older Sir Robert Bellinger, the owner of Consolidated Chemical Industries, the company where she works, so that she can have money to get those things without worry. They will be getting married in the Hebrides on the Isle of Kiloran, which Sir Robert owns and where he already is. The trek to Kiloran from her home in Manchester gives her a taste of her future where all her needs are taken care of every step along the way. That trek hits a delay on the last leg as one weather related issue after another prevents any boat from sailing between Port Erraig on the Isle of Mull to Kiloran. Another person who is trying to get to Kiloran is thirty-three year old Torquil MacNeil, a navy man going home on an eight-day leave. While waiting to get to Kiloran, Torquil and Joan spend time together at the hotel in Tobermoray, the closest actual town to Port Erraig a forty minute drive away, or with Torquil's longtime friend, Catriona Potts née MacLean, who owns a house in Port Erraig while they wait for any actual news of the waters being navigable. Joan learns that Torquil is the actual laird of Kiloran, not Sir Robert who only rented the island for the wedding, but unlike Sir Robert who has money, Torquil is cash poor like most of the residents of the area, who nonetheless seem happy. The longer Joan and Torquil spend together waiting, the more Joan can see her lifelong dream slipping away from her, she who will do anything to achieve that dream... unless she comes to the true realization that she has a new, different dream, which is well within her grasp.

They're accompanied on the mission by Mark William, an American journalist who is there to write about their exploits. The mission goes off without a hitch and without the loss of any men. The plan was for them to be picked up by two transport airplanes at an old landing strip but a Japanese patrol prevents them from doing so. The men are now forced to march towards the front lines, however the closer they get, the greater the number of Japanese troops they will face. With the Air Corps dropping them supplies at agreed locations, the men move on but few of them remain after encounters with the enemy. Eventually, they are all presumed lost just as the invasion is launched.

                    The lonely woman was obviously not attractive -- neither to the battle-scarred man -- nor to the audience. He, burned and scarred, was practically repulsive looking to everyone, including the audience. Once their characters began honestly interacting, however, the audience was allowed to begin to accept them as real, humble, and friendly people -- like themselves. Then, the clever director had the make-up crew begin to -- ever so slowly, practically imperceptively -- soften their features, making their formerly perceived homeliness/ugliness more and more transparent. Thus, as the characters began to fall more in love and began to see the other as the person they had so long sought after, so too, did the audience! Then the characters' true beauty became so apparent, so much as what each would have wanted the other to be, that we, audience and players alike, saw them as the most handsome people we had beheld -- in a moment to remember -- as I have these 61 years since I saw the film. I believe it is one of the most magic 'happenings' on film I've ever witnessed. It's so good to be able to recall that moment so vividly, it 'happened again!

Before leaving his troops, Madden puts Captain Andreas Bonifacio, the grandson of a venerated Philippine leader, in charge. Bonifacio is despondent because his former sweetheart, Dalisay Delgado, now works as a spokesperson for the Japanese and advocates Philippine surrender.As Madden assembles his guerrilla army in the jungle, the Japanese overrun a nearby village and close its school. When a Japanese captain orders Buenaventura Bello, the principal, to haul down the American flag, Bello refuses and is hung from the flag pole for his insubordination. Miss Barnes, the schoolteacher, flees into the jungle with Maximo and the other students and there meets Madden. Her words of inspiration and defiance inspire the guerrillas in their mission to blow up a gasoline dump at a Japanese airfield.Later, word comes of the fall of Bataan and capture of Bonifacio. Madden finds and frees the wounded Bonifacio, however, and Miss Barnes nurses him back to health. Madden and his men then liberate Maximo's village, and after executing the Japanese captain, they place an epitaph on Bello's grave. Although Bonifacio recovers from his wounds, his faith in the Philippine cause is not restored.Madden, aware that Dalisay is working undercover as a messenger in the Philippine independence movement, sends Bonifacio to Manila with a message. There, Bonifacio is surprised to discover that his contact is Dalisay. After she lectures him about the importance of resisting Japanese aggression, Bonifacio returns to the jungle and reluctantly agrees to rejoin the fight until he can leave the country with Dalisay.Over the next several months, as Madden and his machete-wielding army recapture Japanese-held villages, Colonel Kuroki decides to mollify the Philippine people by staging an elaborate ceremony to declare their independence. Madden and his men plan to sabotage the ceremony, and Maximo begs to join them in the attack. Madden refuses but, after giving the boy his colonel's eagle as consolation, orders him to take charge of the other children. As the Japanese begin to broadcast the ceremony, Madden and his men attack and Dalisay denounces the Japanese invaders. After Bonifacio rescues her from the stage, they all retreat into the jungle. Maximo prepares to flee, but is captured by Japanese soldiers and beaten until he agrees to lead them to the guerrilla headquarters. As the boy and his captors drive along a mountain road, Maximo grabs the steering wheel and sends the vehicle plunging from a cliff. Witnessing the accident, Madden and his men rush to the truck, and Maximo dies in the arms of Miss Barnes.Ordered to forge ahead, Madden puts Bonifacio in charge of the guerrillas and departs from the Philippines. Skipping forward several months later in October 1944, the guerrillas are bouyed by word that the ""Yanks"" are landing. After making their way to the beach at Leyte, Bonifacio, who still lacks faith, is amazed to find the beach filled with people awaiting the arrival of an American submarine delivering guns. The appearance of the submarine restores Bonifacio's conviction, and he vows to fight until the end. The submarine also brings Madden and Lt. Commander Waite (Lawrence Tierney) of the United States Navy, who announces that General MacArthur plans to land American troops on the beach at Leyte on October 20.Assigned to block the road from Japanese troops until the beachhead is secured, Madden and his men hide underneath the water in a rice paddy near Japanese headquarters, using reeds to breath. At the proper moment, they spring to the surface to attack. As the guerrillas battle the oncoming Japanese tanks, the Americans arrive with reinforcements. With the defeat of the Japanese, the American flag is hoisted back up the flagpole, and the Philippine people achieve their hard-won freedom.","
    
                    The US Army's defense of its Philippines colony and the allied Malay countries/colonies behind it counted on its island fortress of Corregidor on Luzon -and a few others- but loses it in the 6 May 1942 Japanese combined forces attack. Colonel Joseph Madden is among the escaping survivors who are ordered by general Douglas McArthur to organize a guerrilla. As he finds many native Filipinos inclined to resist the occupier's vision of returning to the South Asian fold under a paternalistic empire which doesn't hesitate to 'spank the unruly', but is mainly civilian, unprepared, inept in military matters, Madden appeals to the legendary anti-US freedom fighter Andres Bonifácio's homonymous grandson Captain Andrés Bonifácio, who is luckily rescued from a POW dead march, to inspire the resistance -once his own fighting spirit is rekindled- with him in a still very unsure war, retaliated by bloody, ten to one repression.

    Synopsis
    On January 30, 1945, the United States Army frees the prisoners in a daring raid being held by the Japanese at the Cabanatuan camp in the Philippines.The groundwork for that liberation began years earlier in March 1942 when Colonel Joe Madden (John Wayne), an American army officer who possesses a strong bond to the Philippine people and a commitment to maintain their independence, is assigned to organize a band of guerrillas to resist the encroaching Japanese army. Before leaving his troops, Madden puts Captain Andreas Bonifacio, the grandson of a venerated Philippine leader, in charge. Bonifacio is despondent because his former sweetheart, Dalisay Delgado, now works as a spokesperson for the Japanese and advocates Philippine surrender.As Madden assembles his guerrilla army in the jungle, the Japanese overrun a nearby village and close its school. When a Japanese captain orders Buenaventura Bello, the principal, to haul down the American flag, Bello refuses and is hung from the flag pole for his insubordination. Miss Barnes, the schoolteacher, flees into the jungle with Maximo and the other students and there meets Madden. Her words of inspiration and defiance inspire the guerrillas in their mission to blow up a gasoline dump at a Japanese airfield.Later, word comes of the fall of Bataan and capture of Bonifacio. Madden finds and frees the wounded Bonifacio, however, and Miss Barnes nurses him back to health. Madden and his men then liberate Maximo's village, and after executing the Japanese captain, they place an epitaph on Bello's grave. Although Bonifacio recovers from his wounds, his faith in the Philippine cause is not restored.Madden, aware that Dalisay is working undercover as a messenger in the Philippine independence movement, sends Bonifacio to Manila with a message. There, Bonifacio is surprised to discover that his contact is Dalisay. After she lectures him about the importance of resisting Japanese aggression, Bonifacio returns to the jungle and reluctantly agrees to rejoin the fight until he can leave the country with Dalisay.Over the next several months, as Madden and his machete-wielding army recapture Japanese-held villages, Colonel Kuroki decides to mollify the Philippine people by staging an elaborate ceremony to declare their independence. Madden and his men plan to sabotage the ceremony, and Maximo begs to join them in the attack. Madden refuses but, after giving the boy his colonel's eagle as consolation, orders him to take charge of the other children. As the Japanese begin to broadcast the ceremony, Madden and his men attack and Dalisay denounces the Japanese invaders. After Bonifacio rescues her from the stage, they all retreat into the jungle. Maximo prepares to flee, but is captured by Japanese soldiers and beaten until he agrees to lead them to the guerrilla headquarters. As the boy and his captors drive along a mountain road, Maximo grabs the steering wheel and sends the vehicle plunging from a cliff. Witnessing the accident, Madden and his men rush to the truck, and Maximo dies in the arms of Miss Barnes.Ordered to forge ahead, Madden puts Bonifacio in charge of the guerrillas and departs from the Philippines. Skipping forward several months later in October 1944, the guerrillas are bouyed by word that the ""Yanks"" are landing. After making their way to the beach at Leyte, Bonifacio, who still lacks faith, is amazed to find the beach filled with people awaiting the arrival of an American submarine delivering guns. The appearance of the submarine restores Bonifacio's conviction, and he vows to fight until the end. The submarine also brings Madden and Lt. Commander Waite (Lawrence Tierney) of the United States Navy, who announces that General MacArthur plans to land American troops on the beach at Leyte on October 20.Assigned to block the road from Japanese troops until the beachhead is secured, Madden and his men hide underneath the water in a rice paddy near Japanese headquarters, using reeds to breath. At the proper moment, they spring to the surface to attack. As the guerrillas battle the oncoming Japanese tanks, the Americans arrive with reinforcements. With the defeat of the Japanese, the American flag is hoisted back up the flagpole, and the Philippine people achieve their hard-won freedom.

                    A rowdy, womanizing merchant marine, leader of an eccentric crew of misfits and drunks, is almost killed by a Japanese torpedo strike. The brush with death seems to make him even more reckless. In San Francisco, he clashes with a sophisticated, cold librarian, but hangs around because of his attraction to her much livelier, flirty roommate. Yet the seaman and the librarian can't quit challenging each other, almost to the point of a physical altercation. Following their most angry, almost violent argument, the two come together as lovers, running off to Reno for a quick, unlikely marriage. But almost immediately after, their differences in values and philosophy come to a head. The mismatched relationship seems doomed - and, possibly, to end in profound tragedy.

                    Prof. Joseph Elsner guides his protégé Frydryk Chopin through his formative years to early adulthood in Poland. At a recital in a duke's home Chopin insults the new Russian-installed governor, and must flee the country. The professor takes him to Paris, where he eventually comes under the wing and influence of novelist George Sand and rises to prominence in the music world, to the exclusion of his old friends and patriotic feelings towards Poland.

                    Under the tutelage of Professor Joseph Elsner, Frédéric Chopin showed great promise as a pianist from an early age. Even at age eleven, Chopin also dabbled in composing. At that age, Chopin was also very patriotic about his homeland, Poland, especially against the ruling Russian authority of the Czar. As a young man, Chopin indeed has become an excellent pianist and composer, playing for the Polish royal house. But he is a man frail in health. An incident at age twenty-two forces Chopin to take immediate leave of Poland. He and Elser decide to go to Paris to take up the offer of the famed publisher and promoter Louis Pleyel from eleven years earlier to perform in concert. Despite his brilliance, Chopin's rise to prominence as a concert pianist and composer is not a smooth one, but one assisted by the equally brilliant pianist/composer, the already famous Franz Liszt, who is a great admirer, and writer, the forthright and strong willed George Sand, whose interest in Chopin is more than in his music. Sand begins to take control of Chopin's life, which is against the direction seen by Elsner, in terms of what Chopin does professionally, how he carries out his work, but perhaps most importantly how his patriotism to a troubled Poland seems to be waning, as witnessed in part by putting off completion of his polonaise, which was to be a tribute to his homeland.

Their patriarch, Patrick Rafferty, is wheelchair bound due to an industrial accident incurred at the Scott family steel mill. He blames the accident on working conditions at the mill and thus he hates the Scotts despite the fact that they have more than adequately financially compensated Patrick. So Patrick is not too happy when his daughter Mary goes to work as a domestic in the Scott household. Despite Mary's lack of experience, she quickly becomes close friends with the entire family of parents William and Clarissa, and children William Jr., Paul, Ted and Constance. It is Paul from whom she attracts the most attention; the two fall in love. But Mary does not want to risk Paul's social standing and with the help of Clarissa decides to place some distance between herself and Paul. When William Sr. notices Paul's total obsession with work and the reason for Mary's departure, he decides Mary's return would be the best thing for Paul. After Mary's return, a strike occurs at the mill. Paul and Mary try to broker a deal between the Scott's and the workers, most of whom are friends of the Rafferty's. An undelivered communique results in tragic consequences. Despite still being in love, Paul and Mary realize a union between them is now impossible. Making other life choices - an especially unhappy one for Paul - Mary and Paul may still be able to eke out a life together due to a move by Clarissa, the move solely in an effort to ensure the continuation of the Scott name with the mill.

                    After robbing a stagecoach, the gunman Monte Jarrad is wounded and hunted with a one thousand-dollar reward. Meanwhile, the clumsy cowboy Melody Jones and his old partner George Fury ride through the wrong road and reach Payneville. When the locals see the initials MJ on Melody's saddle and his appearance, he is mistaken by the dangerous criminal. Melody believes that the respectful behavior is because he is an unsmiling man. Melody is saved from a shot by Cherry de Longpre, who is Monte's girlfriend, and they head to her ranch where the hideout of the wounded Monte is. Cherry plots a plan sending Melody with Monte's saddle to the North to lure the posse while Monte heads to South. But the naive cowboy is in love with Cherry and decides to return to the ranch instead against the will of his friend George.

He instead would rather farm his own land, and thus decides to rent some property down by the river which has been unfarmed for some years. With no savings but excited by the prospect of working for himself, Sam brings his family - his wife Nona, his two adolescent children Jot and Daisy, and his ornery and stubborn paternal Granny - to their new home on that property. Although he figures his hard work will be able to do the work of clearing and seeding the cotton crop despite not having the modern farming equipment, he is unprepared for the fact of the house being run down with need of major repairs, and the well being dry. Regardless, Nona also buys into the dream and they decide to stay. They bring Sam's mother as well in the spring to help. They suffer some hardships living on that farm, and although Sam and Nona are willing to trade whatever they can, they are going to require the kindness of others to help them through, including from their less than neighborly neighbor Devers, the physician Dr. White, and Harmie the local shopkeeper. The Tuckers learn that to live off the land, they must take what the land and nature has to give back in all its good and bad. During the bad, Sam may feel that the life of his friend Tim, who earns more than a good wage working in a factory, may be a better life for the family.

Henry believes no such nonsense, although Emilie does believe that houses retain a little of each of its previous residents. They hire young Annette Allenby to be Emilie's companion, Annette who is drawn to something about the house. She is also drawn to Dr. Robert Selbie, as he is to her as the two soon become engaged. Over time, mysterious things do happen at the house, and on occasion Annette feels as though something or someone is possessing her. As neither Robert or Henry believe in ghosts, they have to come up with a plausible explanation for what is happening to Annette, especially why she keeps speaking of a Dr. Marsham, who happened to be Miss Harkness' physician. But Emilie is certain that Miss Harkness has some destiny to fulfill before the house and Annette can be in peace.

                    1940 London. Robert and Cathy Wilson, a bookkeeper and housewife respectively, are in a staid marriage. Each is devoted to the other, and each feels the other is dependent on him/herself to survive. Each is delicate in nature, and would not use the words ""handsome"" or ""pretty"" to describe the other. They live a stultifying life of routine, and not taking a stand on anything. That means not rocking the boat in their marriage, each quietly tolerating their lot in life in not wanting to hurt the other. Robert enlists in the Navy as part of the war effort. While Robert is away, Cathy decides to join the Women's Royal Naval Service (WREN) to get away from the flat she detests so much. In their respective time away, each changes fundamentally as a person, allowed the freedom truly to break out of their shell. Their transformations are also physical, where they would now be considered masculinely handsome and pin-up beautiful, which leads to each falling in love with someone else, upon which neither acts. After close to four years of not seeing each other, each is provided a ten-day leave. They both dread seeing each other again, and returning to their pre-war life. Even though each is who he/she wants to be and who they want the other to be, the questions become whether they can see that based on their shared history, or get over the expectation of what they believe the other to be also based on that shared history.

                    In WWII Pat Jamieson is a scientist working, with Government support, on a high-altitude oxygen mask for fighter pilots. But he has nowhere to conduct his research in secret until he meets Jamie Rowan, a woman with an unused house with a scientist's basement. Jamie has no hopes of marrying for love (and neither does Pat) but Jamie wants to help the war effort and she likes this quirky scientist and his dog, so to satisfy the proprieties they agree on a business arrangement: a marriage of convenience and partnership. They happily work on oxygen mixes instead of honeymooning. But as the footing of their relationship begins warm up, Jamie is courted by another man and the old flame that broke Pat's heart is back in his life. It will take a sleepwalking ruse, dodging in and out of doors, and a working oxygen mask to get them together again.

                    Preface: a stentorian narrator tells us that the USA was flooded with Nazi spies in 1939-41. One such tries to recruit college grad Bill Dietrich, who becomes a double agent for the FBI. While Bill trains in Hamburg, a street-accident victim proves to have been spying on atom-bomb secrets; conveniently, Dietrich is assigned to the New York spy ring stealing these secrets. Can he track down the mysterious ""Christopher"" before his ruthless associates unmask and kill him?

                    Prior to the United States entering WWII, the FBI is monitoring known and suspected Nazi agents in the country. Purely by happenstance, they discover a Nazi cell in the US trying to smuggle information back to Germany on Process 97, a key part of the American atomic bomb development. The FBI's Inspector George Briggs leads this case, known as the Christopher Case as the unknown leader of the Nazi cell has the code name Mr. Christopher. Briggs' team cannot just bring in the known Nazi agents, but rather they have to find out exactly how the information is being leaked and who Mr. Christopher is. They co-opt the assistance of William Dietrich, a German-American university student who the Nazis tried to recruit. As such, he will be working for the FBI as a double agent (i.e. he will go along with the Nazi recruitment plan). Unknown on either side, it becomes a race as Dietrich's Nazi contacts in the United States, led by Elsa Gebhardt (fronting as a women's gown designer), don't fully trust him and come ever so close to discovering his double agent status, while Briggs, Dietrich and their associates close in on the leak and the identity of Mr. Christopher. The modi operandi for both sides change slightly with December 7, 1941.

One of Mrs. Hughes' stipulations is that whomever she hire treat this job as one of a long term nature, meaning no current boyfriends or marriage on the horizon. The closest person to Julia was Dennis Bruce, who lived at the same boarding house and who was somewhat sweet on Julia but left to get married to another woman. As such, Julia is grateful for her new job. When Julia awakens after her first night at the Hughes home, she learns she has been asleep for two days. She is no longer in the urban London home she knows as Mrs. Hughes' home, but rather a sprawling and isolated estate by the sea in Cornwall. All evidence of her being Julia Ross has disappeared. And everyone in the house, including Mrs. Hughes, Mrs. Hughes' son Ralph, and all the household servants, try to convince her that she is Marion Hughes, Ralph's wife who is recovering from a nervous breakdown. Julia is certain of who she is, and suspects the Hugheses are going to kill her for whatever reason. Julia is alone with no one to support her claim and thus help her as the Hugheses have made her seem crazy to whomever she has spoken. However, initially unknown to the Hugheses, Dennis Bruce, who ended up not getting married, returned to the rooming house just before Julia's departure and made a date with her. Since she didn't keep the date, he goes looking for her.

                    This drama centers on a Red Army officer (Paul Muni), a Russian woman (Lisa Elenko), and seven German soldiers who have been trapped in the ruined cellar of a bombed out factory in a German-controlled town. While waiting for someone to rescue them, the two Russians try to keep the Germans away. Eventually the Russian officer begins toying with a German officer, and vice versa, as both seek to extract information from the other. The Russian lets on that his troops are planning to construct a tunnel beneath the river. The woman is appalled at this betrayal of information, but her companion reassures her that he can kill the enemy before they have time to share that information, but first they need to get rescued. As time slowly passes, the tension increases, especially when the Soviet begins to fall asleep. The film was made during the brief period after WW II when Russia and the U.S. were allies and the political overtones of the film were unintentional. Later, with the advent of the Cold War, many of the actors who participated in this film were called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, accused of being Communist sympathizers, and some were blacklisted.

                    Stationed in Italy during WWII, British officer Roger Morland gets his fellow officer, Alan Quinton, to write love letters to his casual girlfriend, Victoria Remington, back home, as Roger doesn't have the wherewithal to do so himself. Based on Victoria's responses, Alan can tell that Victoria has fallen in love with Roger because of those letters, and in turn Alan, without admitting it to himself, has fallen in love with Victoria without even knowing what she looks like. On one of Roger's training missions back in England, Roger and Victoria get married which irks Alan because he knows she is not marrying who she thinks he is - he truly being beneath her in spirit - that person with who she has fallen in love being non-existent as an amalgam of Roger's physical being and Alan's emotional being. Alan's feelings are despite he being engaged himself, to Helen Wentworth, about who he does not feel the same in that he could never have written those love letters to her. Back in England himself on a medical discharge, Alan learns that Roger has died tragically, not in combat, but while he was at home. As such, Alan, with only Victoria's previous address in Longreach, Essex County in hand, subconsciously takes steps to locate her by living in an isolated house he inherited in Beltmarsh, also in Essex. What Alan discovers second hand is that Victoria murdered Roger, although Alan believes he truly is the murderer, the weapon being those love letters. What he also later learns is that he had previously met Victoria at a party in London, she a young woman going by the name Singleton, who knows nothing of her Victoria past as she is suffering from amnesia, including remembering nothing about the trial when she was convicted or her one year incarceration. With all this knowledge, Alan truly falls in love with all that is Victoria/Singleton, and Singleton with him, the two who want to spend their lives together. Alan does however realize that if Singleton were ever to regain her memory of being Victoria, it would not only destroy their life together, but her entire being, especially in knowing his role in what happened in her previous life.

                    1895. The residents of the rural coal mining village of Glansarno, Wales are surprised not only that the new resident from London, L.C. Moffatt, M.A., is not Lieutenant-Colonel Moffatt as they expected him to be, but rather independently-minded, financially self-sufficient and well-educated spinster Lilly Cristobel Moffatt, Master of Arts, such a woman who is extraordinary for the area. When Miss Moffatt learns that the majority of the children of the area are poor and illiterate - the boys being sent to work in the mines as early as age twelve to help provide for their families - she decides that she is going to use her money to open a school, she even willing to pay the families the money for the wages no longer earned by the boys. Despite their initial opposition in dealing with a woman like her, Miss Moffatt is able to co-opt the assistance of two somewhat educated locals, Mr. Jones and Miss Ronberry, to help her run the school, she sensing their own dissatisfaction with their current lot in life in Glansarno. What Miss Moffatt does not expect is the extent of the opposition to the school by the mine officials, led by Mr. Trevorby, a local squire with a vested interest in the mine operation, who believe that education is useless for the boys and the school is taking away their workforce. She considers throwing in the towel in her fight with the mine until she reads a short essay written by one of the older students, Morgan Evans, who, despite the technical problems with the piece, she sees as a boy who truly has deep thoughts and would truly benefit from an education. Morgan and Miss Moffatt's relationship is not always a smooth one, as Morgan sometimes has to reconcile this education against what he sees as his destiny of going back to the mines, while Miss Moffatt eventually sees higher education as his new destiny, something that would require him to obtain a scholarship. But the biggest threat to Morgan's future in academia and the existence of the school altogether is Bessie Watty, the opportunistic daughter of Miss Moffatt's Cockney housekeeper from London, reformed Mrs. Watty who even admits that she does not like her daughter despite her own criminal past.

Dr. Elise Bork (Tala Birell) and her henchman Lang (Douglass Dumbrille) are the Nazi chiefs, posing as scientists. Lang has great influence on some of the tribesman, especially with Chief Maata (Napoleon Simpson') who wants to keep Kyba (Clarence Muse) from becoming judge over all the tribes. A Secret Sword is the key to the ruler of the jungles, and the holder of this secret is sought by both the British and the Nazis. Courtney is the only white man who knows the secret but is killed before he can reveal it to his niece Pamela. The forces of good finally prevail in Chapter 13, ""The Secret of the Sword!"", through the help of Lotel, who disappears in the same sheet of flame that has marked her coming and going.
