The first character introduced in the movie is Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez (the Ugly) - called Tuco - (Eli Wallach), who has a bounty on his head for numerous crimes. Tuco has a partnership with Blondie (The Good, played by Clint Eastwood) in which the latter turns him in for the reward money which the two then split after Blondie saves Tuco from hanging at the last moment. Meanwhile, a third character called Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef, playing the Bad) has learned of a hidden trunk of gold owned by a Confederate soldier named Bill Carson. He sets off to find the gold.Soon, Blondie grows tired of his relationship with Tuco, and leaves Tuco in the desert with no water. Tuco survives and is intent on exacting revenge on his former partner. He finds Blondie, and turns the tables by planning to abandon him in the desert. However, before Tuco can complete his torture in the New Mexico desert, a runaway stagecoach full of dead and dying Confederate soldiers appears. Bill Carson, the man with knowledge of the whereabouts of the gold, dying from thirst, persuades Tuco to get him a drink by disclosing the name of the graveyard where the loot is located. As Tuco goes for the water, Carson dies, but not before revealing the name on the grave to Blondie.Dressed in the uniforms of the dead soldiers, Tuco takes Blondie, near death, to a local Catholic mission run by his brother, a priest. While Blondie recovers, Tuco and his brother (Luigi Pistilli) confront each other about the mistakes each has made in life. After leaving the mission, the two, still impersonating Confederate soldiers are captured and taken to a Union prison camp. Angel Eyes has followed the trail of Bill Carson to the prison camp and is posing as a Union Sergeant.Angel Eyes and his colleague Wallace beat and torture Tuco until he reveals the location of the cemetery. When Angel Eyes learns that only Blondie knows the name, he changes tactics. He proposes a partnership, and accompanied by five or six other killers, they leave to find the coins. Tuco escapes while being transported from the camp by train, in the process killing Wallace. At the nearest town, Tuco encounters a bounty hunter (Al Mulock) he had wounded at the beginning of the film, who seeks his revenge. As Tuco shoots the bounty hunter, Blondie, who is in the same town with Angel Eyes, recognizes the sound of Tuco's gun, seeks him out, and he and Tuco resume their old partnership. Together they kill Angel Eyes' gunmen along the main street, but Angel Eyes himself escapes.Tuco and Blondie stumble on a battle between the Union and the Confederates, fighting for a bridge of questionable strategic value. Since the cemetery is on the other side of the bridge, they decide to destroy it and force the soldiers go somewhere else to fight. While they are setting up the dynamite, Tuco reveals that the cemetery is called Sad Hill and Blondie reveals that the coins are buried in a grave marked by the name of Arch Stanton (Adam S. Gottbetter).On the other side of the river Tuco deserts Blondie by horseback and finally enters the nearby graveyard.Tuco frantically searches around the graveyard for the grave of Arch Stanton. Eventually Tuco finds it, but before he can begin digging he's held at gunpoint by Blondie, who in turn is held at gunpoint by Angel Eyes, who has finally caught up to both of them. However, Blondie reveals that Arch Stanton's grave contains only a decomposing corpse.Blondie then leads the three of them into an empty patch of land in the middle of the cemetery. He writes the name of the real grave under a stone which he places in the center.At the conclusion of a three-way shootout, Blondie shoots Angel Eyes and Tuco finds his gun empty, having been unloaded the previous night by Blondie. Blondie then reveals that the real location of the coins is a grave marked ""Unknown"" right next to Arch Stanton. Tuco digs up the loot from the grave only to find himself once again staring down the barrel of Blondie's gun, who now holds a noose in his hand. After placing Tuco into the noose, fastening it to a nearby tree and making Tuco stand on the unstable wooden cross of one of the graves, Blondie takes half the coins and rides away while Tuco cries for help. In a dramatic twist, Blondie turns around to shoot the rope above Tuco's head, as he used to do in their times of partnership, freeing him one last time before riding off as Tuco screams in rage.","
    
                    Blondie (The Good) is a professional gunslinger who is out trying to earn a few dollars. Angel Eyes (The Bad) is a hit man who always commits to a task and sees it through, as long as he is paid to do so. And Tuco (The Ugly) is a wanted outlaw trying to take care of his own hide. Tuco and Blondie share a partnership together making money off Tuco's bounty, but when Blondie unties the partnership, Tuco tries to hunt down Blondie. When Blondie and Tuco come across a horse carriage loaded with dead bodies, they soon learn from the only survivor (Bill Carson) that he and a few other men have buried a stash of gold in a cemetery. Unfortunately Carson dies and Tuco only finds out the name of the cemetery, while Blondie finds out the name on the grave. Now the two must keep each other alive in order to find the gold. Angel Eyes (who had been looking for Bill Carson) discovers that Tuco and Blondie met with Carson and knows they know the location of the gold. All he needs is for the two to lead him to it. Now The Good, The Bad and The Ugly must all battle it out to get their hands on $200,000 worth of gold.

"2","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060827/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Persona begins with images of camera equipment and projectors lighting up and projecting dozens of brief cinematic glimpses, including a crucifixion, an erect penis, a tarantula spider, clips from a comedic silent-film reel first seen in Bergman's Prison (depicting a man trapped in a room, being chased by Death and Satan), and the slaughter of a lamb. The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Michail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (""Vår Tids Hjälte"" in the film), and caressing a blurry image of Elisabet and/or Alma's faces.A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera. As the two women leave the hospital together, Alma reads aloud a letter Elisabet's husband has sent her, which includes a photograph of her young son.Together in the administrator's cottage, Elisabet begins to relax, though she remains completely silent and non-responsive. Alma speaks constantly to break the silence, at first about books she is reading and trivial matters, then increasingly about her own anxieties and relationship with her fiancé, Karl-Henrik, who scolds her for lacking ambition ""though not with my career, I suppose in some greater way."" Alma constantly compares herself to Elisabet and begins to grow attached to her. As the act closes, Alma confesses to cheating on her fiancé in a ménage à quatre with underage boys. She became pregnant, and had Karl-Henrik's friend abort the baby; ""and that was that"". She is not sure how to process the abortion mentally. Elisabet is heard to say ""You ought to go to bed, or you'll fall asleep at the table"", but Alma dismisses it as a dream. Elisabet later denies speaking.Alma drives into town, taking Elisabet's letters for the postbox, but parks by the roadside to read what she wrote. She discovers in Elisabet's letters that Elisabet has been analyzing her and ""studying"" her. Alma returns distraught, accidentally breaks a drinking glass on the footpath, and leaves the shards there to cut Elisabet. When Elisabet's feet start to bleed, her gaze meets Alma's knowingly, and the film itself breaks apart: the screen flashes white, scratch marks appear up and down the image, the sound rises and screeches, and the film appears to unwind as brief flashes of the prelude reappear for fractions of a second each.When the film resumes, it is following Elisabet through the house with a thick blur on the lens. The image clears up with a sharp snap when she looks out the window before walking outside to meet Alma, who is weepy and bitter. At lunch, she tells Elisabet she has been hurt by Elisabet talking about her behind her back, and begs her to speak. When Elisabet does not react, the nurse flies into a rage. Alma tries to attack her and chases her through the cottage, but Elisabet hits her during the ensuing scuffle causing Alma's nose to start bleeding. In retaliation, Alma grabs a pot of boiling water off the stove and is about to fling it at Elisabet, but stops after hearing Elisabet wail ""No!"" Alma explains that Elisabet wouldn't have spoken had she not feared death. Alma goes to the bathroom, washes her face, and tries to pull herself together. She then goes to Elisabet and frustrated by her unresponsiveness tells her, ""You are inaccessible. They said you were healthy, but your sickness is of the worst kind: it makes you seem healthy. You act it so well everyone believes it, everyone except me, because I know how rotten you are inside."" Elisabet tries to walk away, but Alma pursues and continues to accost her. Elisabet flees, and Alma chases her begging for forgiveness. That evening, Elisabet opens a book she is reading and finds a famous Stroop Report photograph of Jews being arrested in the Warsaw Ghetto. Elisabet stares at details in the photograph, but mostly at the boy with his hands raised.That night, Alma watches Elisabet sleep, analyzing her face and the scars she covers with makeup. She hears a man yelling outside, and finds Elisabet's husband, Mr. Vogler, in the garden. Mr. Vogler (portrayed by Gunnar Björnstrand) mistakes Alma for his wife, and despite her repeatedly interjecting with ""I'm not your wife"", delivers a monologue about his love for her and the son they have together (repeating words he wrote to Elisabet in the opening act ""We must see each other as two anxious children""). Elisabet stands quietly beside the two, holding Alma's hand, and Alma admits her love for Mr. Vogler and accepts her role as the mother of Elisabet's child. The two make love with Elisabet sitting quietly next to the bed with a look of panic on her face, and afterward, Alma cries. The image of Elisabet becomes blurry.The climax of the film comes the next morning; Alma catches Elisabet in the kitchen with a pained expression on her face, holding a picture of a small boy. Alma then narrates Elisabet's life story back to her, while the camera focuses tightly on Elisabet's anguished face: at a party one night, a man tells her ""Elisabet, you have it virtually all in your armory as woman and artist. But you lack motherliness."" She laughs, because it sounds silly, but the idea sticks in her mind, and she lets her husband impregnate her. As the pregnancy progresses, she grows increasingly worried about her stretching and swelling body, her responsibility to her child, the pain of birth, and the idea of abandoning her career. Everyone Elisabet knows constantly says ""Isn't she beautiful? She has never been so beautiful"", but Elisabet makes repeated attempts to abort the fetus. After the child is born, she is repulsed by it, and prays for the death of her son. The child grows up tormented and desperate for affection. The camera turns to show Alma's face, and she repeats the same monologue again. At its conclusion, one half of the face of Alma and the other of Elisabet's visage are shown in split screen, such that they appear to have become one face. Alma panics and cries ""I'm not like you. I don't feel like you. I'm not Elisabet Vogler: you are Elisabet Vogler. I'm just here to help you!"" Alma leaves, and later returns, to find that Elisabet has become completely catatonic. Alma falls into a strange mood and gashes her arm, forcing Elisabet's lips to the wound and subsequently beating her. Alma packs her things and leaves the cottage alone, as the camera turns away from the women to show the crew and director filming the scene.","
    
                    A young nurse, Alma, is put in charge of Elisabeth Vogler: an actress who is seemingly healthy in all respects, but will not talk. As they spend time together, Alma speaks to Elisabeth constantly, never receiving any answer. Alma eventually confesses her secrets to a seemingly sympathetic Elisabeth and finds that her own personality is being submerged into Elisabeth's persona.

                    Swedish actress Elisabet Vogler, while on stage during a performance of Elektra, becomes mute. The day following, she is in a near catatonic state. The doctors in charge of her case diagnose no medical reason that would cause these disabilities. A nurse named Alma is assigned to be Elisabet's caretaker, she who believes that there is some sort of inner strength that Elisabet possesses to choose not to speak. Since Elisabet is not allowed visits by either her husband or her son, the doctor provides her own secluded beach side summer house as a respite for Elisabet and Alma. To break the silence during the respite, Alma speaks continually to Elisabet, ultimately about personal details of her life. Elisabet responds to Alma's talking, and Alma uses these situations as her own therapy sessions. Alma admires Elisabet and wants to be like her. As the women spend more time alone together, Alma learns more about her patient. But Alma also begins a transformation, which she now knowingly tries to stop because of those things she has learned about Elisabet.

I don't feel like you. I'm not Elisabet Vogler: you are Elisabet Vogler. I'm just here to help you!"" Alma leaves, and later returns, to find that Elisabet has become completely catatonic. Alma falls into a strange mood and gashes her arm, forcing Elisabet's lips to the wound and subsequently beating her. Alma packs her things and leaves the cottage alone, as the camera turns away from the women to show the crew and director filming the scene.

                    Thomas is a London-based photographer who leads the life of excess typical of late 1960s mod London. He is primarily a highly sought-after studio fashion photographer, although he is somewhat tiring of the vacuousness associated with it. He is also working on a book, a photographic collection of primarily darker images of human life, which is why he spent a night in a flophouse where he secretly took some photos. While he is out one day, Thomas spies a May-September female-male couple being affectionate with each other in a park. From a distance, he clandestinely starts to photograph them, hoping to use the photographs as the final ones for his book. The female eventually sees what he is doing and rushes over wanting him to stop and to give her the roll of film. She states that the photographs will make her already complicated life more complicated. Following him back to his studio, she does whatever she needs to to get the film. He eventually complies, however in reality he has provided her with a different roll. After he develops the photographs, he notices something further in the background of the shots. Blowing them up, he believes he either photographed an attempted murder or an actual murder. The photos begin a quest for Thomas to match his perception to reality.

    Synopsis
    The plot is 24 hours in the life of a glamorous fashion photographer named Thomas (David Hemmings), inspired by the life of an actual ""Swinging London"" photographer, David Bailey.In the opening scene, Thomas wakes up after spending the night at a doss house where he has taken pictures for a book of art photos.

"4","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060397/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","A commercial airliner lands at JFK Airport in New York. A Secret Serviceman (Ken Scott), backed by a large Army contingent, greets the plane. After it taxis to a stop, Lieutenant Charles Grant USN (Stephen Boyd) steps out onto a mobile boarding ramp, verifies the Secret Service escort, and then signals to the other passenger, Jan Benes (Jean Del Val), to deplane with him. Benes walks down and gets into the Secret Service car, but not before warmly shaking Grant's hand one last time.But as the motorcade enters a run-down section of New York, a car hurtles out of an alley and broadsides Benes' car. Hastily the Secret Service transfer Benes to another car, which then must make a quick escape as the Secret Service contingent fights a gun battle with several other assailants in the surrounding buildings.Benes is taken to the underground headquarters of the Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces (CMDF) and given a full physical examination, including an EEG. The results are dire: he has suffered a stroke on the left side, in an inoperable spot. The doctors induce a coma so that his brain will not damage itself, while they decide what to do.The original Secret Service man then picks up Grant and delivers him to an alley, instructing him to stay in the car and wait. Then the car, with Grant alone in it, descends to an underground complex. A small scooter bearing the CMDF logo, which he does not recognize, picks him up and delivers him to the Medical Section. There, Grant meets CMDF's commandant, Lieutenant General Alan Carter USA (Edmund O'Brien). General Carter first shows him Benes, in a coma and on a litter. Then he introduces him to the surgeon, Dr. Peter Duval (Arthur Kennedy), and his assistant Cora Peterson (Raquel Welch), who will operate on Benes, and also to Dr. ""Mike"" Michaels (Donald Pleasence), who is somehow expected to watch Duval to make sure that Duval does not try to kill his patient while operating. Then Carter explains what CMDF means, and about the miniaturization technique that is at the heart of it all. The problem: the USA (and the USSR) can miniaturize any object, to any size, but cannot hold an object miniaturized for more than 60 minutes. Benes knows how to extend the time, and Grant is the one who brought Benes out when he sought to defect. Now Carter reveals why Grant is there: CMDF will reduce a small submarine to microscopic size, and deliver Duval, Miss Peterson, Michaels--and Grant--into Benes' body, to operate on Benes from the inside.Grant hates the idea. Worse yet, CMDF Medical Officer Col. Donald Reid (Arthur O'Connell) does not want a woman to go along on such a hazardous mission. Duval insists that he will have Cora or no one at his side. Grant also meets Captain Wilfrid Owens (William Redfield), designer and pilot of the submarine. The plan: reduce the submarine with all aboard and inject it into the left carotid artery. They will follow this to the site of the stroke, where Dr. Duval will use a hand-held laser to dissolve the clot. Then they travel back along the left internal jugular to the base of the neck, where they will be removed. The problem: if they stay in longer than 60 minutes, they will grow to a size that the immune system will notice, and Benes' own defenses will mobilize to destroy them.Grant barely has time to take in a briefing before Michaels leads him, Duval, Cora, and Owens to a ""sterilization room."" There they dress in white SCUBA wetsuits, with white overalls over this, all bearing the CMDF logo, and pass through a corridor that irradiates them gently with UVA to kill any germs on their bodies. As Carter and Reid make their preparations, the crew then climbs aboard their submarine (USS Proteus, U-91035) and make preparations for getting under way. Owens and Grant install a tiny reactor containing a microscopic radioactive particle, that will power the sub once they are shrunk. (Radioactive material cannot miniaturize.) Grant tests the ship's wireless, which will be his station. Owens tells Michaels how he will be able to read Michaels' details charts of Benes' circulatory and lymphatic systems. Cora mounts and tests the laser, while also teasing Grant about his still-obvious fear of being ""shrunk."" (Grant has, throughout, tried to cover his fear with bad jokes and worse innuendo, and doesn't fool Cora for one second.) Cora also reveals that she is a five-year veteran of CMDF and has worked with Duval all that time.Carter radios them to ""prepare for miniaturization."" So the crew pull out their seats, strap in, and settle in. Everything goes well, except for the time that Michaels, suffering an attack of claustrophobia, tries to get out through the topside hatch (after they are already submerged in an outsized hypodermic syringe), forcing Duval and Grant to restrain him and calm him down. (Duval and Grant have taken their first shot at working together, as they cooperate with Owens to accomplish the submersion.) With the second miniaturization step, the Proteus can now generate its own power. Eventually, the surgical team injects them into the carotid artery.And then the problems begin. At first the view is fascinating, But then Proteus drifts into a strong current, then into a whirlpool. It catches the crew unaware, so that though Michaels and Duval can regain their seats, Grant and Cora cannot. Michaels' shoulder belts pop, and Duval struggles to hold him in. Cora is dragged into a bulkhead, and only Grant's iron grip on her stops her from breaking her neck. Finally the Proteus comes out of the whirlpool--but now the blood cells surrounding them are blue, not the red they remembered. They realize (as do Carter and Reid, watching from outside) that Proteus has gone through an arterio-venous fistula from the carotid artery into the jugular vein. Now they are headed toward the superior vena cava, and will go through the heart--which will smash them. Michaels urges immediate removal, but the authorities, under Carter's leadership, have another idea: to put Benes into cardiac arrest and let Proteus swim through as fast as her drive can propel her. This they do, and Proteus dives into the right ventricle and goes out through the pulmonic valve, with three seconds to spare.Now they head into the lungs, where they observe oxygenation of the blue corpuscles that surround them. Just then, Proteus develops an air leak, which Owens stops, but only after Proteus has lost so much air that she cannot continue. Grant offers a solution: he will take the boat's snorkel and enter an alveolus to take the air that Benes breathes. Owens insists that everyone else aboard except himself join Grant in the dive, for safety reasons. As they put on their SCUBA gear, Grant discovers that the laser has broken loose and gotten knocked around. He firmly tells Duval and Cora to wait on testing the laser until after Grant finishes his snorkel operation.Grant succeeds in pulling in the air--but then his safety line snaps and he finds himself sucked into a bronchiole with Benes' next breathe-out. When Benes breathes in again, he luckily finds the original alveolus, after which he races to safety, with Duval strenuously pulling him back out into the bloodstream.Proteus gets back underway, heading into the pleural cavity. During this time, Cora disassembles the laser and discovers a smashed transistor and a broken trigger wire. Grant supplies replacements for both by cannibalizing the wireless and sending one last message, to the consternation of Carter and Reid. The transistor is of a good size, but the trigger wire is far too large--but Duval believes that he can scrape it down.Grant also takes time to discuss with Michaels a hard reality: someone has tried to sabotage the mission at least twice. Grant knows that Cora had indeed fastened the laser securely--so someone must have unfastened it, just as someone tampered with Grant's safety line. Michaels protests that he cannot think so ill of Duval, the logical suspect.Proteus enters the lymphatic system and passes through a lymph node. The boat blunders into several reticular fibers, and Owens warns that if they keep running into the seaweed-like fibers, they'll block the water jet intakes, and Proteus' engines will overheat. The crew also observe a stray bacterium, and antibodies attacking it and squeezing it to death.Grant is frustrated with the delay and the slow progress. Duval then suggests going to the inner ear--a very hazardous path, because the slightest noise will kill them, and they cannot warn the operating team. Grant expresses confidence that the surgical team, once they see where they are headed, will keep the required silence. Michaels is still dubious, but reluctantly agrees to navigate to Benes' left ear.Inside the ear, Owens must stop--the engines have overheated. Grant, Cora, and Michaels make another dive to pull the reticular fibers out of the intakes. Topside, a nurse (Shelby Grant) gets the idea of plugging Benes' ear with cotton--but then drops a pair of scissors to the floor. With the result that Proteus and her crew are badly shaken up. Cora gets the worst of it--she is carried into the Organ of Corti and finds herself trapped among the Cells of Hensen. She cries out for help, and Michaels and Grant race to her rescue--but Grant orders Michaels back aboard Proteus when he cannot go any further. Grant frees Cora from the hair cells, and they race back to the airlock--but as they wait for it to re-flood (after Michaels used it), antibodies attack Cora and fasten onto her. Grant hastily guides her into the airlock, closes the hatch--and then raps on the door when Cora makes plain that she simply cannot breathe. Michaels, Duval, and Owens open the airlock before it is fully evacuated, pull Cora out, and, with Grant's help, start pulling the antibody molecules off her body. Soon they start crystallizing and come off easily, so Cora is saved.Proteus gets back under way, passes through the middle ear, and then passes through the endolymphatic duct back into the vascular system. Now they penetrate into the brain and reach the clot. During that passage, Michaels and Duval argue about whether Duval, having repaired the laser, should test it. Duval insists on using the laser as-is, not wanting to strain it.Eventually they reach the clot. But with so little time remaining, Michaels wants Owens to take Proteus back out. But now Grant shuts down the power and insists that Duval and Cora go out and operate. Michaels strenously objects, but Grant firmly overrides him, saying that Duval simply does not fit the profile of a fanatic.Now Grant makes his near-fatal mistake: instead of remaining aboard, he goes out to see if he can ""help"" Duval and Cora. Duval manages to clear the clot, at least enough to get the blood flowing again and relieve the pressure on a key nerve. But aboard Proteus, Michaels knocks out Owens, and then restores power, takes the helm, and sends Proteus on a collision course for the nerve. Grant asks for the laser, and fires a wide-angle beam at Proteus, raking her port side and sending her away from the nerve and into several nearby dendrites. White corpuscles respond immediately, so Grant slips back aboard, through the tear in the hull, to rescue Michaels and Owens if he can. Owens is only now regaining consciousness, so Grant tells him to suit up as fast as he can. But when he tries to untangle Michaels from the wrecked helm station, a white cell settles over the helmsman's dome, breaks through, and suffocates Michaels. Grant and Owens then abandon ship, before the white corpuscles crush it. Duval keeps the white cells at bay long enough for Grant and Owens to escape, before the laser quits for good.Topside, Carter and Reid reluctantly order the removal of Proteus, because time has run out. Inside Benes' body, the four remaining crew swim as fast as they can along the optic nerve, toward Benes' left eye. Carter allows the attending surgeon to make preparations for a trephination procedure--and then deduces what the crew might do and stops the attending in mid-motion. Reid, too, realizes how they crew can still escape, and rushes down to the operating room and asks for a large magnifier. Through this, he looks into Benes' left eye, in time to make out four members of the crew swimming in Benes' tears. He calls for a microscope slide and uses it to lift out a teardrop, with the crew inside. Then he asks the staff to open the door, and as quickly as he dares, walks out into the miniaturization room and sets the slide gently down on the center hexagon. The crew then grows to full size, and the rest of the staff warmly greet them and assure them that the operation is a complete success.NOTE: The film, as it played, had a number of scientific inaccuracies and plot holes. Isaac Asimov, who wrote the novelization from the final shooting script, repaired these and at least tried to produce a scientifically consistent narrative. The key differences are:* The time limit on miniaturization is not a uniform sixty minutes. Instead, the rule is that energy of miniaturization (which is a function of the proportion of normal size to reduced size), when multiplied by duration of miniaturization, is equal to Planck's constant divided by two times pi. In simpler terms, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle governs the maximum time of miniaturization at any given size. Benes' secret is another set of variables that the original pioneering scientists overlooked. The sixty minutes that apply to this narrative are a special case of that model.* Grant's role and authority are broader than as depicted in the film version. In the novel, Grant, not Michaels, has the ultimate authority on policy decisions, and is another brain and pair of hands in an emergency. Cora, sensing right away that the CMDF brass put him on board because they suspect Duval of murderous intent, at first resents him bitterly, and then softens toward him and almost pleads with him to understand Duval's politics, that have caused CMDF to doubt him. Those politics are that the Two Sides in the Cold War ought to share scientific discoveries freely, without regard to strategic sensitivity. But Duval is not the saboteur, a thing Grant comes to deduce by process of elimination.* When Grant makes his first dive with the snorkel into Benes' lungs, Owens uses the on-board miniaturizer that Proteus carries, to reduce the air to a size compatible with Proteus and her crew in their shrunken state. Otherwise, Grant would have been trying to draw in oxygen molecules large enough to see.* When Grant's safety line parts, sending him up the bronchiolar tree, Duval suggests that Owens orient the Proteus to face the alveolar wall and shine the boat's headlight into it. That allows Grant to find the right alveolus again. Otherwise he would have been hopelessly lost.* As Carter and Reid watch Proteus enter the inner ear, they do not use their PA system to announce to the surgical team the hazard against making noise. Instead, Carter writes a note and sends an orderly to walk into the OR in his stockinged feet to hand it to the attending. When, later, he wants to suggest plugging Benes' ears, he sends another note the same way. (The nurse does not take that upon herself, but acts only when she gets Carter's second note. And when the scissors fall, she steps on them so that they won't rattle and thus risk more damage than they might already have caused.)* When Cora falls into the organ of Corti and finds herself wedged among the hair cells, the antibodies take time to ""taste"" her before they come swarming. Benes' body would never have had antibodies specific to her at the moment of contact. This is still a stretch, because the immune system is now known to take much longer than that to raise antibodies to anything, and through a process that is much more complex than that depicted in film or novel.* When the crew pull Cora back aboard, they only have to give one good tug at one clinging antibody molecule, before realizing that all the antibodies crystallize at once, and all they need do is brush them off. The air on board ""hits"" the antibodies and denatures them immediately. So the dramatic (and suggestive) grabbing procedure is not necessary.* When Duval and Cora make their dive to attack the clot with the laser, Cora wears her wetsuit inside out, in order not to present a recognizable target to any stray antibodies that might be lurking about. Benes might not have been ""immunized"" against her before, but he is now.* After clubbing Owens, Michaels, unaccountably, bundles him into a wet suit and drops him out the airlock. Perhaps Michaels takes no chances that Owens might come to himself and try to take his ship back. With the result that Grant's quick rescue operation becomes unnecessary.* After the Proteus crashes into the dendrites, Duval worries that the damage that Michaels has done might start a new clot. This apparently does not happen, but at least Asimov acknowledges the possibility, which the original script does not even talk about.* After the white corpuscles eat the Proteus, Grant knows that they can't just leave her in place. Even when crushed, Proteus will grow to a size to kill Benes. (Michaels also realizes this at the last instant of his life, which is why he bursts out laughing as the white corpuscle collapses the glass dome over his head.) So Grant takes out his dagger and slashes at the white cell to attract its attention and induce it to follow them out. Of course, that releases chemotaxins that bring a swarm of white cells, so the crew must swim for their lives to get out ahead of them. (Furthermore, the medical team topside do not stop tracking Proteus even as they prepare for the trephination procedure. When the monitoring techs realize that Proteus seems to be moving again, Carter stops the preparations. That's when Reid realizes that the crew are using an escape route he did not at first consider.)* The crew, swimming toward the eye, do not drop the laser. Instead, Cora tries to carry the laser out.

                    Scientist Jan Benes, who knows the secret to keeping soldiers shrunken for an indefinite period, escapes from behind the Iron Curtain with the help of CIA agent Grant. While being transferred, their motorcade is attacked. Benes strikes his head, causing a blood clot to form in his brain. Grant is ordered to accompany a group of scientists as they are miniaturized. The crew has one hour to get in Benes's brain, remove the clot and get out.

                    The battle being waged by the super powers is who can perfect miniaturization. Now both sides are stumped as to how to control it. So far they can miniaturize anything but up to 60 minutes only. A scientist who is believed to have solved it, was about to give it to the Americans when an attempt is made on his life. Fortunately he is not dead but he is in a coma and any conventional means to operate could be fatal. So a plan is made to miniaturize a vessel and send a team of doctors into the man's body and that they will go to the damaged area and fix it. Problem is that there is a report that someone on the team could be working for the other side. So they send Grant, a government agent to make sure everything goes OK.

                    The brilliant scientist Jan Benes develops a way to shrink humans, and other objects, for brief periods of time. Benes, who is working in communist Russia, is transported by the CIA to America, but is attacked en route. In order to save the scientist, who has developed a blood clot in his brain, a team of Americans in a nuclear submarine is shrunk and injected into Benes' body. They have a finite period of time to fix the clot and get out before the miniaturization wears off.

    Synopsis
    A commercial airliner lands at JFK Airport in New York. A Secret Serviceman (Ken Scott), backed by a large Army contingent, greets the plane. After it taxis to a stop, Lieutenant Charles Grant USN (Stephen Boyd) steps out onto a mobile boarding ramp, verifies the Secret Service escort, and then signals to the other passenger, Jan Benes (Jean Del Val), to deplane with him. Benes walks down and gets into the Secret Service car, but not before warmly shaking Grant's hand one last time.But as the motorcade enters a run-down section of New York, a car hurtles out of an alley and broadsides Benes' car. Hastily the Secret Service transfer Benes to another car, which then must make a quick escape as the Secret Service contingent fights a gun battle with several other assailants in the surrounding buildings.Benes is taken to the underground headquarters of the Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces (CMDF) and given a full physical examination, including an EEG. The results are dire: he has suffered a stroke on the left side, in an inoperable spot. The doctors induce a coma so that his brain will not damage itself, while they decide what to do.The original Secret Service man then picks up Grant and delivers him to an alley, instructing him to stay in the car and wait. Then the car, with Grant alone in it, descends to an underground complex. A small scooter bearing the CMDF logo, which he does not recognize, picks him up and delivers him to the Medical Section. There, Grant meets CMDF's commandant, Lieutenant General Alan Carter USA (Edmund O'Brien). General Carter first shows him Benes, in a coma and on a litter. Then he introduces him to the surgeon, Dr. Peter Duval (Arthur Kennedy), and his assistant Cora Peterson (Raquel Welch), who will operate on Benes, and also to Dr. ""Mike"" Michaels (Donald Pleasence), who is somehow expected to watch Duval to make sure that Duval does not try to kill his patient while operating. Then Carter explains what CMDF means, and about the miniaturization technique that is at the heart of it all. The problem: the USA (and the USSR) can miniaturize any object, to any size, but cannot hold an object miniaturized for more than 60 minutes. Benes knows how to extend the time, and Grant is the one who brought Benes out when he sought to defect. Now Carter reveals why Grant is there: CMDF will reduce a small submarine to microscopic size, and deliver Duval, Miss Peterson, Michaels--and Grant--into Benes' body, to operate on Benes from the inside.Grant hates the idea. Worse yet, CMDF Medical Officer Col. Donald Reid (Arthur O'Connell) does not want a woman to go along on such a hazardous mission. Duval insists that he will have Cora or no one at his side. Grant also meets Captain Wilfrid Owens (William Redfield), designer and pilot of the submarine. The plan: reduce the submarine with all aboard and inject it into the left carotid artery. They will follow this to the site of the stroke, where Dr. Duval will use a hand-held laser to dissolve the clot. Then they travel back along the left internal jugular to the base of the neck, where they will be removed. The problem: if they stay in longer than 60 minutes, they will grow to a size that the immune system will notice, and Benes' own defenses will mobilize to destroy them.Grant barely has time to take in a briefing before Michaels leads him, Duval, Cora, and Owens to a ""sterilization room."" There they dress in white SCUBA wetsuits, with white overalls over this, all bearing the CMDF logo, and pass through a corridor that irradiates them gently with UVA to kill any germs on their bodies. As Carter and Reid make their preparations, the crew then climbs aboard their submarine (USS Proteus, U-91035) and make preparations for getting under way. Owens and Grant install a tiny reactor containing a microscopic radioactive particle, that will power the sub once they are shrunk. (Radioactive material cannot miniaturize.) Grant tests the ship's wireless, which will be his station. Owens tells Michaels how he will be able to read Michaels' details charts of Benes' circulatory and lymphatic systems. Cora mounts and tests the laser, while also teasing Grant about his still-obvious fear of being ""shrunk."" (Grant has, throughout, tried to cover his fear with bad jokes and worse innuendo, and doesn't fool Cora for one second.) Cora also reveals that she is a five-year veteran of CMDF and has worked with Duval all that time.Carter radios them to ""prepare for miniaturization."" So the crew pull out their seats, strap in, and settle in. Everything goes well, except for the time that Michaels, suffering an attack of claustrophobia, tries to get out through the topside hatch (after they are already submerged in an outsized hypodermic syringe), forcing Duval and Grant to restrain him and calm him down. (Duval and Grant have taken their first shot at working together, as they cooperate with Owens to accomplish the submersion.) With the second miniaturization step, the Proteus can now generate its own power. Eventually, the surgical team injects them into the carotid artery.And then the problems begin. At first the view is fascinating, But then Proteus drifts into a strong current, then into a whirlpool. It catches the crew unaware, so that though Michaels and Duval can regain their seats, Grant and Cora cannot. Michaels' shoulder belts pop, and Duval struggles to hold him in. Cora is dragged into a bulkhead, and only Grant's iron grip on her stops her from breaking her neck. Finally the Proteus comes out of the whirlpool--but now the blood cells surrounding them are blue, not the red they remembered. They realize (as do Carter and Reid, watching from outside) that Proteus has gone through an arterio-venous fistula from the carotid artery into the jugular vein. Now they are headed toward the superior vena cava, and will go through the heart--which will smash them. Michaels urges immediate removal, but the authorities, under Carter's leadership, have another idea: to put Benes into cardiac arrest and let Proteus swim through as fast as her drive can propel her. This they do, and Proteus dives into the right ventricle and goes out through the pulmonic valve, with three seconds to spare.Now they head into the lungs, where they observe oxygenation of the blue corpuscles that surround them. Just then, Proteus develops an air leak, which Owens stops, but only after Proteus has lost so much air that she cannot continue. Grant offers a solution: he will take the boat's snorkel and enter an alveolus to take the air that Benes breathes. Owens insists that everyone else aboard except himself join Grant in the dive, for safety reasons. As they put on their SCUBA gear, Grant discovers that the laser has broken loose and gotten knocked around. He firmly tells Duval and Cora to wait on testing the laser until after Grant finishes his snorkel operation.Grant succeeds in pulling in the air--but then his safety line snaps and he finds himself sucked into a bronchiole with Benes' next breathe-out. When Benes breathes in again, he luckily finds the original alveolus, after which he races to safety, with Duval strenuously pulling him back out into the bloodstream.Proteus gets back underway, heading into the pleural cavity. During this time, Cora disassembles the laser and discovers a smashed transistor and a broken trigger wire. Grant supplies replacements for both by cannibalizing the wireless and sending one last message, to the consternation of Carter and Reid. The transistor is of a good size, but the trigger wire is far too large--but Duval believes that he can scrape it down.Grant also takes time to discuss with Michaels a hard reality: someone has tried to sabotage the mission at least twice. Grant knows that Cora had indeed fastened the laser securely--so someone must have unfastened it, just as someone tampered with Grant's safety line. Michaels protests that he cannot think so ill of Duval, the logical suspect.Proteus enters the lymphatic system and passes through a lymph node. The boat blunders into several reticular fibers, and Owens warns that if they keep running into the seaweed-like fibers, they'll block the water jet intakes, and Proteus' engines will overheat. The crew also observe a stray bacterium, and antibodies attacking it and squeezing it to death.Grant is frustrated with the delay and the slow progress. Duval then suggests going to the inner ear--a very hazardous path, because the slightest noise will kill them, and they cannot warn the operating team. Grant expresses confidence that the surgical team, once they see where they are headed, will keep the required silence. Michaels is still dubious, but reluctantly agrees to navigate to Benes' left ear.Inside the ear, Owens must stop--the engines have overheated. Grant, Cora, and Michaels make another dive to pull the reticular fibers out of the intakes. Topside, a nurse (Shelby Grant) gets the idea of plugging Benes' ear with cotton--but then drops a pair of scissors to the floor. With the result that Proteus and her crew are badly shaken up. Cora gets the worst of it--she is carried into the Organ of Corti and finds herself trapped among the Cells of Hensen. She cries out for help, and Michaels and Grant race to her rescue--but Grant orders Michaels back aboard Proteus when he cannot go any further. Grant frees Cora from the hair cells, and they race back to the airlock--but as they wait for it to re-flood (after Michaels used it), antibodies attack Cora and fasten onto her. Grant hastily guides her into the airlock, closes the hatch--and then raps on the door when Cora makes plain that she simply cannot breathe. Michaels, Duval, and Owens open the airlock before it is fully evacuated, pull Cora out, and, with Grant's help, start pulling the antibody molecules off her body. Soon they start crystallizing and come off easily, so Cora is saved.Proteus gets back under way, passes through the middle ear, and then passes through the endolymphatic duct back into the vascular system. Now they penetrate into the brain and reach the clot. During that passage, Michaels and Duval argue about whether Duval, having repaired the laser, should test it. Duval insists on using the laser as-is, not wanting to strain it.Eventually they reach the clot. But with so little time remaining, Michaels wants Owens to take Proteus back out. But now Grant shuts down the power and insists that Duval and Cora go out and operate. Michaels strenously objects, but Grant firmly overrides him, saying that Duval simply does not fit the profile of a fanatic.Now Grant makes his near-fatal mistake: instead of remaining aboard, he goes out to see if he can ""help"" Duval and Cora. Duval manages to clear the clot, at least enough to get the blood flowing again and relieve the pressure on a key nerve. But aboard Proteus, Michaels knocks out Owens, and then restores power, takes the helm, and sends Proteus on a collision course for the nerve. Grant asks for the laser, and fires a wide-angle beam at Proteus, raking her port side and sending her away from the nerve and into several nearby dendrites. White corpuscles respond immediately, so Grant slips back aboard, through the tear in the hull, to rescue Michaels and Owens if he can. Owens is only now regaining consciousness, so Grant tells him to suit up as fast as he can. But when he tries to untangle Michaels from the wrecked helm station, a white cell settles over the helmsman's dome, breaks through, and suffocates Michaels. Grant and Owens then abandon ship, before the white corpuscles crush it. Duval keeps the white cells at bay long enough for Grant and Owens to escape, before the laser quits for good.Topside, Carter and Reid reluctantly order the removal of Proteus, because time has run out. Inside Benes' body, the four remaining crew swim as fast as they can along the optic nerve, toward Benes' left eye. Carter allows the attending surgeon to make preparations for a trephination procedure--and then deduces what the crew might do and stops the attending in mid-motion. Reid, too, realizes how they crew can still escape, and rushes down to the operating room and asks for a large magnifier. Through this, he looks into Benes' left eye, in time to make out four members of the crew swimming in Benes' tears. He calls for a microscope slide and uses it to lift out a teardrop, with the crew inside. Then he asks the staff to open the door, and as quickly as he dares, walks out into the miniaturization room and sets the slide gently down on the center hexagon. The crew then grows to full size, and the rest of the staff warmly greet them and assure them that the operation is a complete success.NOTE: The film, as it played, had a number of scientific inaccuracies and plot holes. Isaac Asimov, who wrote the novelization from the final shooting script, repaired these and at least tried to produce a scientifically consistent narrative. The key differences are:* The time limit on miniaturization is not a uniform sixty minutes. Instead, the rule is that energy of miniaturization (which is a function of the proportion of normal size to reduced size), when multiplied by duration of miniaturization, is equal to Planck's constant divided by two times pi. In simpler terms, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle governs the maximum time of miniaturization at any given size. Benes' secret is another set of variables that the original pioneering scientists overlooked. The sixty minutes that apply to this narrative are a special case of that model.* Grant's role and authority are broader than as depicted in the film version. In the novel, Grant, not Michaels, has the ultimate authority on policy decisions, and is another brain and pair of hands in an emergency. Cora, sensing right away that the CMDF brass put him on board because they suspect Duval of murderous intent, at first resents him bitterly, and then softens toward him and almost pleads with him to understand Duval's politics, that have caused CMDF to doubt him. Those politics are that the Two Sides in the Cold War ought to share scientific discoveries freely, without regard to strategic sensitivity. But Duval is not the saboteur, a thing Grant comes to deduce by process of elimination.* When Grant makes his first dive with the snorkel into Benes' lungs, Owens uses the on-board miniaturizer that Proteus carries, to reduce the air to a size compatible with Proteus and her crew in their shrunken state. Otherwise, Grant would have been trying to draw in oxygen molecules large enough to see.* When Grant's safety line parts, sending him up the bronchiolar tree, Duval suggests that Owens orient the Proteus to face the alveolar wall and shine the boat's headlight into it. That allows Grant to find the right alveolus again. Otherwise he would have been hopelessly lost.* As Carter and Reid watch Proteus enter the inner ear, they do not use their PA system to announce to the surgical team the hazard against making noise. Instead, Carter writes a note and sends an orderly to walk into the OR in his stockinged feet to hand it to the attending. When, later, he wants to suggest plugging Benes' ears, he sends another note the same way. (The nurse does not take that upon herself, but acts only when she gets Carter's second note. And when the scissors fall, she steps on them so that they won't rattle and thus risk more damage than they might already have caused.)* When Cora falls into the organ of Corti and finds herself wedged among the hair cells, the antibodies take time to ""taste"" her before they come swarming. Benes' body would never have had antibodies specific to her at the moment of contact. This is still a stretch, because the immune system is now known to take much longer than that to raise antibodies to anything, and through a process that is much more complex than that depicted in film or novel.* When the crew pull Cora back aboard, they only have to give one good tug at one clinging antibody molecule, before realizing that all the antibodies crystallize at once, and all they need do is brush them off. The air on board ""hits"" the antibodies and denatures them immediately. So the dramatic (and suggestive) grabbing procedure is not necessary.* When Duval and Cora make their dive to attack the clot with the laser, Cora wears her wetsuit inside out, in order not to present a recognizable target to any stray antibodies that might be lurking about. Benes might not have been ""immunized"" against her before, but he is now.* After clubbing Owens, Michaels, unaccountably, bundles him into a wet suit and drops him out the airlock. Perhaps Michaels takes no chances that Owens might come to himself and try to take his ship back. With the result that Grant's quick rescue operation becomes unnecessary.* After the Proteus crashes into the dendrites, Duval worries that the damage that Michaels has done might start a new clot. This apparently does not happen, but at least Asimov acknowledges the possibility, which the original script does not even talk about.* After the white corpuscles eat the Proteus, Grant knows that they can't just leave her in place. Even when crushed, Proteus will grow to a size to kill Benes. (Michaels also realizes this at the last instant of his life, which is why he bursts out laughing as the white corpuscle collapses the glass dome over his head.) So Grant takes out his dagger and slashes at the white cell to attract its attention and induce it to follow them out. Of course, that releases chemotaxins that bring a swarm of white cells, so the crew must swim for their lives to get out ahead of them. (Furthermore, the medical team topside do not stop tracking Proteus even as they prepare for the trephination procedure. When the monitoring techs realize that Proteus seems to be moving again, Carter stops the preparations. That's when Reid realizes that the crew are using an escape route he did not at first consider.)* The crew, swimming toward the eye, do not drop the laser. Instead, Cora tries to carry the laser out. When Cora inevitably starts flagging, Grant takes the laser and its power pack away from her so that she can swim unencumbered.* Finally, when Col. Reid extracts the crew, he does not try to walk with the slide into the miniaturizer room. Instead, he sets the slide on the operating-room floor where he stands and orders everyone out of the room, including Benes, whom the staff wheel out on his litter. When the crew re-magnify, General Carter takes a quick muster with his eyes and realizes, with a sickening feeling in his gut, that Michaels and the Proteus are both missing. Grant stops him and assures him that the pile of metal fragments next to the crew is what's left of both.The novel has a few more dramatic differences--offering a more detailed explanation of the science of miniaturization, and making more of the professional (or personal) relationships between General Carter and Colonel Reid, between Reid and Michaels, between Grant and Benes on the flight in, between Duval and Cora, and especially between Cora and Grant during and after the trip. (See above.) Grant also has a scene with Carter and Reid in which he acknowledges his mistake in going out on the dive with Duval and Cora, instead of remaining on board after he, in effect, had placed Michaels under arrest. The novel ends with an inspiring scene in which Grant, fully grown once more, pays a visit to Benes, who by now has regained consciousness and can even talk to him.BENES: And now I must remember what I came here to tell. It's a little fuzzy, but it's still all in there.GRANT: You'd be surprised to know what's in you, Professor.

He shows that they were not just painted by a contemplative monk in a peaceful monastery. They were painted in the midst of the bustling life and terrible cruelty of medieval Russia, a land of ignorant peasants, cruel princes and Tartars invading thrice a year.Part I (86 mins.)Chapter 1Hot-Air BalloonChapter 2The Buffoon, 1400 AD.The opening image is of three monks who set off for Moscow across a harvested field: Kirill, Andrei and Danila. They take shelter from a rainstorm in a barn/inn. There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD.This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel.An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him.Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand.Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers! You have made his temple a den of thieves.Chapter 4The Passion according to Andrei, 1406 AD The chapter opens with Father Andrei walking through a forest with his apprentice, Foma. Andrei tells him, ""I washed brushes for three years for Danila before he trusted me with an icon. And then only to clean it, not to create one"". He and Foma meet Theophanes the Greek, who despairs of his countrymen:""The day of judgement is coming. We will all burn like candles!""Andrei replies, ""I don't understand how you can paint, with such opinions. If I thought like this, I would have vowed silence and gone to live in a cave.""Theophanes: ""All is vanity! All is useless! Humanity has already committed all stupidities, and is starting to repeat them.""Andrei replies with a meditation on the suffering of the Russian people, illustrated by the passion of Father Kirill.Chapter 5Pagan Feast, 1408 AD.This is a Midsummer festival, where the monks observe naked peasants running through the forest carrying flaming torches, or standing in the river, holding the torches high and paying homage to the image of their deity, floating downriver in a little boat.Chapter 6 Last Judgement, 1408 ADAndrei is unable to paint the Last Judgement on the whitewashed walls of a new church, because he doesnt want to scare the people.Part II (99 mins.)Chapter 1Raid on the city of Vladimir, 1408 AD.To revenge himself on his brother, the Grand Prince, the younger brother (the Little Prince) leads a band of Tartars into the city of Vladimir.They break down the door of the cathedral, where the people have taken refuge. They torture, murder and rape the people, and set fire to the building. The Tartars climb to the roof and plunder the gold leaf from the dome. The Little Prince looks on grimly. Only Andrei and a halfwit, dumb girl, Durochka, survive. Before the burned-out iconostasis, in the cathedral filled with corpses, with the ghost of Theophanes as his witness, he vows silence.Chapter 2The Silence, 1412 ADFamine ravages the countryside, and a haggard Father Kirill returns, begging to be taken back into the monastery.Chapter 3The Bell, 1423 ADA teenaged lad, Boris, tells some soldiers, who are looking for a bell-founder, ""My father is dead of the plague, so are my mother and sister. But my father told me the secret of the bell before he died. I have the secret of bell bronze"".He is taken to cast a new bell for the Grand Prince of Vladimir.Andrei is a silent observer of the trials of the bell casting. At one point, he is confronted by Father Kirill:""You know why I left the monastery? I envied your talent. Envy was eating out my soul. I left because of you. And look at you now! You are wasting your talent. It is a sin to waste your God-given talent!""After the first ringing of the bell, Boris, begins to weep, crying that his father did not give him the secret of the bell.Andrei comforts him, ""Dont cry!

    Synopsis
    Director Andrei Tarkovsky shows the beautiful icons created by this famous iconographer only at the end of this long, long film. He shows that they were not just painted by a contemplative monk in a peaceful monastery. They were painted in the midst of the bustling life and terrible cruelty of medieval Russia, a land of ignorant peasants, cruel princes and Tartars invading thrice a year.Part I (86 mins.)Chapter 1
Hot-Air BalloonChapter 2
The Buffoon, 1400 AD.
The opening image is of three monks who set off for Moscow across a harvested field: Kirill, Andrei and Danila. They take shelter from a rainstorm in a barn/inn. There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3
Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD.
This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel.
An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him.
Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand.
Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers! You have made his temple a den of thieves.Chapter 4
The Passion according to Andrei, 1406 AD The chapter opens with Father Andrei walking through a forest with his apprentice, Foma. Andrei tells him, ""I washed brushes for three years for Danila before he trusted me with an icon. And then only to clean it, not to create one"". He and Foma meet Theophanes the Greek, who despairs of his countrymen:
""The day of judgement is coming. We will all burn like candles!""
Andrei replies, ""I don't understand how you can paint, with such opinions. If I thought like this, I would have vowed silence and gone to live in a cave.""
Theophanes: ""All is vanity! All is useless! Humanity has already committed all stupidities, and is starting to repeat them.""
Andrei replies with a meditation on the suffering of the Russian people, illustrated by the passion of Father Kirill.Chapter 5
Pagan Feast, 1408 AD.This is a Midsummer festival, where the monks observe naked peasants running through the forest carrying flaming torches, or standing in the river, holding the torches high and paying homage to the image of their deity, floating downriver in a little boat.Chapter 6 Last Judgement, 1408 AD
Andrei is unable to paint the Last Judgement on the whitewashed walls of a new church, because he doesnt want to scare the people.Part II (99 mins.)Chapter 1
Raid on the city of Vladimir, 1408 AD.
To revenge himself on his brother, the Grand Prince, the younger brother (the Little Prince) leads a band of Tartars into the city of Vladimir.
They break down the door of the cathedral, where the people have taken refuge. They torture, murder and rape the people, and set fire to the building. The Tartars climb to the roof and plunder the gold leaf from the dome. The Little Prince looks on grimly. Only Andrei and a halfwit, dumb girl, Durochka, survive. Before the burned-out iconostasis, in the cathedral filled with corpses, with the ghost of Theophanes as his witness, he vows silence.Chapter 2
The Silence, 1412 AD
Famine ravages the countryside, and a haggard Father Kirill returns, begging to be taken back into the monastery.Chapter 3
The Bell, 1423 AD
A teenaged lad, Boris, tells some soldiers, who are looking for a bell-founder, ""My father is dead of the plague, so are my mother and sister. But my father told me the secret of the bell before he died. I have the secret of bell bronze"".
He is taken to cast a new bell for the Grand Prince of Vladimir.
Andrei is a silent observer of the trials of the bell casting. At one point, he is confronted by Father Kirill:
""You know why I left the monastery? I envied your talent. Envy was eating out my soul. I left because of you. And look at you now! You are wasting your talent. It is a sin to waste your God-given talent!""
After the first ringing of the bell, Boris, begins to weep, crying that his father did not give him the secret of the bell.
Andrei comforts him, ""Dont cry! You will go on to cast many bells, and I will go on to paint icons"".At this point, the film suddenly switches to colour, and we are shown Rublev's icons in loving detail.

Martha announces she has invited a young couple--Nick (George Segal), a young, good-looking, newly appointed instructor, and his mousey wife Honey (Sandy Dennis)--to join them for late-night drinks. George is disturbed because she did so without consulting him first, prompting Martha to launch into the first of many loud and lengthy tirades during which she taunts and criticizes him. Knowing his wife is drunk and quite lewd, he asks her to behave herself when they arrive, and when the doorbell rings, he warns her to refrain from mentioning their child to their company.Overhearing Martha's crude retort as the door opens, Nick and Honey immediately feel ill at ease and quickly find themselves caught in the middle of a verbal war zone when their efforts to engage in small talk set off a volley of insults between their hosts. Martha begins to flirt lewdly with Nick while his meek wife tries to pretend she is unaware of what is happening.While Martha is showing Honey where the bathroom is, George tests Nick's verbal sparring skills, but the young man is no match for his host. Realizing he and his wife are becoming embroiled in the middle of marital warfare, he suggests they depart, but George cajoles him into staying.Upon returning to the living room alone, Honey innocently mentions to George she was unaware he and Martha had a son on the verge of celebrating his 16th birthday. Martha reappears in a new outfit--form-fitting slacks and a revealing blouse--and when her husband makes a snide remark about the ensemble, she begins to demean his abilities as a teacher, then escalates her seduction of Nick, complimenting him on the body he developed as both a quarterback and an intercollegiate state boxing champion while criticizing George's paunch. She informs their guests about a past incident when George refused to engage in a friendly outdoor boxing match with his father-in-law and Martha put on a pair of gloves and punched him in the jaw, knocking him into the bushes. As she relates the story, George aims a shotgun at the back of her head, causing Honey to scream. He pulls the trigger, which releases an umbrella, while he tells his wife she's dead.Honey again raises the subject of George and Martha's son, prompting the couple to engage in a conversation Martha quickly tries to end without success. To counterattack George's relentless comments about the boy, she tells their guests her husband is unsure the child is his own, although he most assuredly is. They argue about the color of the boy's eyes until George threatens to expose the truth about the boy. Furious, Martha accuses him of being a failure whose youthful, idealistic plans for the future slowly deteriorated as he came to realize he wasn't aggressive enough to follow in his father-in-law's footsteps, leaving her stuck with a flop. George cuts the diatribe short by spinning Honey around and mockingly singing, ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", a joke the shrewed Martha had made herself during the party earlier that evening.Inebriated and on the verge of throwing up from George's spinning, Honey rushes from the room. Martha goes to the kitchen to make coffee, and George and Nick go outside. The younger man confesses he was attracted to Honey more for her family's money than passion, and married her only because she mistakenly believed she was pregnant. George describes his own marriage as one of never-ending accommodation and adjustment, then admits he considers Nick a threat. George also tells a story about a boy he grew up with. This boy had accidentally killed his mother. Years later, George claims the boy was driving with his father. He swerved to ""miss a porcupine"" in the road, and the resulting accident killed his father. The boy ended up living out his days in a mental hospital.When their guests propose leaving, George insists on driving them home. In the car, the talk returns to George and Martha's son. They approach a roadhouse, and Honey suggests they stop to dance. While Honey and George watch, Nick suggestively dances with Martha, who continues to mock George and criticize his inadequacies. George unplugs the jukebox and announces the game is over. In response, Martha alludes to the fact he may have murdered his parents like the protagonist in his unpublished, non-fiction novel, prompting George to strangle Martha until Nick manages to pull him away from her.George convinces the owner to serve them one more round before closing and suggests that, having played a game of 'Humiliate the Host', the quartet should now engage in 'Hump the Hostess' or 'Get the Guests'. He then tells the group about a second novel he allegedly has written about a young couple from the Midwest, a good-looking teacher and his timid wife, who marry because of her hysterical pregnancy and then settle in a small college town. An embarrassed Honey realizes Nick indiscreetly told George about their past and runs from the room with Nick in pursuit.In the parking lot, George tells his wife he cannot stand the way she constantly humiliates him, and she tauntingly accuses him of having married her for just that reason. Their rage erupts into a declaration of ""total war."" Martha drives off with Nick and Honey, leaving her husband to follow on foot.When George arrives home, he discovers Honey nearly delirious and realizes his wife has taken Nick upstairs. When Martha accuses Nick of being sexually inadequate, he blames his impotency on all the liquor he has consumed. George mentions his and Martha's son, prompting her to reminisce about his birth and childhood and how he nearly was destroyed by his father. George accuses Martha of engaging in destructive and abusive behavior with the boy, who frequently ran away to escape her sexual advances. George then announces he has received a telegram with bad news--the boy was killed the previous afternoon on a country road when he swerved to avoid hitting a porcupine and crashed into a tree.As Martha argues with George that he ""can't do this"" and begs him not to ""kill"" their son, Nick suddenly realizes the truth--Martha and George had never been able to have a baby, for reasons that are unexplained. Instead, their game together is to imagine they have a son and invent situations and stories of him. By declaring their son dead, accordingly, George has ""killed"" him. (There are hints of this throughout the movie that become clear in retrospect--for example, when George and Nick were sitting by the swing waiting for Honey to finish throwing up, George comments quietly that Martha never had any pregnancies.)The young couple departs quietly, and George and Martha are left alone as the day begins to break outside. They speak quietly, and in the last lines Martha answers the title question with ""I am, George, I am.""","
    
                    George and Martha are a middle aged married couple, whose charged relationship is defined by vitriolic verbal battles, which underlies what seems like an emotional dependence upon each other. This verbal abuse is fueled by an excessive consumption of alcohol. George being an associate History professor in a New Carthage university where Martha's father is the President adds an extra dimension to their relationship. Late one Saturday evening after a faculty mixer, Martha invites Nick and Honey, an ambitious young Biology professor new to the university and his mousy wife, over for a nightcap. As the evening progresses, Nick and Honey, plied with more alcohol, get caught up in George and Martha's games of needing to hurt each other and everyone around them. The ultimate abuse comes in the form of talk of George and Martha's unseen sixteen year old son, whose birthday is the following day.

                    Psychological realism and foul language: George and Martha are as far from the bourgeois 1950s perfect married couple as you can get, alternatively badgering, berating, abusing and loving each other, both alone and accompanied by the naive young married couple that have come over for a nightcap. The fun and games in which George and Martha involve Nick and Honey are a lacerating look at the older couple's existence, where the emotional brutalizing fill an unspeakable void at their center, and a troubling preview of what the younger couple's life could become. Combines the banal, the vulgar and the poetic.

                    One literate and profane night in the pathological marriage of two tortured souls, a middle-aged New England professor and his carping wife. Turning the underbelly of bourgeois academia into a microcosm of human relationships in all their arduous complexities, it's a harrowing descent into the private lives and painful secrets of two couples thrown together for an evening. George is an associate professor of history who has turned to alcohol to deal with his vituperative, vicious wife Martha, whose appetite for administering abuse knows no bounds. Invited to the couple's home for late-night drinks are new professor Nick, and his naive wife Honey, where over the course of the evening, the polished veneer of the hosts tarnishes grotesquely. The witty repartee of consummate sophisticate Martha degenerates into increasingly violent verbal abuse of both her husband and guests, while George's stoic facade crumbles both physically and emotionally. The horrified Nick and Honey initially come off as happier foils to the misery of the older married couple, but the guests are soon mirroring George and Martha in their mutual antagonism, giving voice to buried resentments and alcohol-fueled revelations of repressed injuries.

                    Luther Heggs aspires to be a reporter for his small town newspaper, the Rachel Courier Express. He gets his big break when the editor asks him to spend the night at the Simmons mansion that 20 years before was the site of a now famous murder-suicide. The case has aroused local interest not only because of the anniversary but because the family heir, Nick Simmons, has returned to Rachel planning to tear the mansion down. Luther's account of his wild, ghost-ridden night in the house leads Simmons to sue for libel, but with the aid of his friend Kelsey, they determine what exactly happened that night long ago and the identity of the real killer.

He also pines for town babe Alma, who's already seeing the newspaper's main writer, Ollie. The film is centered around the Old Simmons House, which is known as a ""murder house"" around town due to the murder/suicide of Mr. and Mrs. Simmons 20 years earlier. Rumor has it that you can hear the ghost of Mr. Simmons playing the organ at midnight. To boost newspaper sales, Luther is assigned to spend the night in the house on the night of the 20th anniversary of the murders. All is well until midnight, when Luther sees the old organ begin to play by itself (the film's title tune is used in this and other scenes). His story makes him the town hero until Nicholas Simmons, nephew of the deceased couple, sues Luther for libel. In the courtroom, Luther is made to look the fool, but the judge orders the courtroom to the Simmons House at midnight to allow Luther to prove his story. Nothing happens, of course, but after everyone except Luther leaves, the old organ begins to play and he finds Mr. Kelsey, the newspaper's janitor, tickling the keys...

                    A film commissioned by the Algerian government that shows the Algerian revolution from both sides. The French foreign legion has left Vietnam in defeat and has something to prove. The Algerians are seeking independence. The two clash. The torture used by the French is contrasted with the Algerian's use of bombs in soda shops. A look at war as a nasty thing that harms and sullies everyone who participates in it.

The NLF sends three women with bombs to two bars and the Air France office in the European quarter, killing many people. The French government sends the military forces under the command of the abusive Colonel Mathieu that does not respect the human rights and uses torture to destroy the NLF command.

                    1954. France, after the independence of the nations comprising Indochina, turns its attention to incidents in French Algeria, which they have ruled for approximately one hundred thirty years. The National Liberation Front (FLN) is leading the resistance in Algeria against their colonial rulers, the FLN who the French authorities believe, or want to believe, comprise only a small minority of the Muslim Algerian population in wanting Algerian independence. Specific incidents in this battle in Algiers between 1954 and the time of independence in 1962 are presented. The FLN began their campaign in shooting military police in the Casbah, the predominantly Muslim quarter of the city, as they were able to blend back into the scene with the support of the populace. These initial one by one attacks escalated on both sides to mass killings, where collateral damage was seen as being acceptable. Both sides also worked toward the United Nations discussion on the issue, each wanting global support for their cause. The events largely focus on two people, one on each side. The first is Ali La Pointe, a lifelong petty criminal and illiterate who the FLN recruited after being politicized while in prison. The second is French paratrooper Colonel Mathieu, a lead French strategist whose main goal is to dismantle the FLN activities by ""cutting off the head of the tapeworm"".

Michael and his family finally reach a house which is tended by the bizarre, satyr-like Torgo, who takes care of the house ""while the Master is away."" Michael and Margaret ask Torgo for directions to Valley Lodge; Torgo simply replies that there is no place like that around here. With this information, Michael asks Torgo to let him and his family stay the night, despite objections from both Torgo and Margaret.Inside the home, the family sees a disturbing painting of a dark, malevolent-looking man and a black dog with glowing eyes; the man it depicts is the Master. Margaret becomes frightened upon hearing an ominous howl; Michael investigates, retrieving a flashlight and revolver from his car, and later finds Peppy lying dead on the ground. Torgo reveals his attraction to Margaret and tells her that, although she is doomed to become yet another bride of The Master, he intends to keep her for himself. Margaret threatens to tell Michael of Torgo's advances, but Torgo convinces her not to say anything to her husband by promising to protect her. Michael returns, unable to start the car. With the revelation that there is no phone in the house, the family reluctantly decides to stay the night.Michael and Margaret stumble upon ""The Master"" and several women dressed in translucent nightgowns and later revealed to be his wives. They are all asleep. Torgo uses a stick to knock out Michael, and then ties Michael to a pole, after dragging him to it, and The Master suddenly comes to life. His wives also awaken, and a short argument over the fate of the family ensues. The Master decides he must sacrifice Torgo and his first wife to the film's mysterious deity and namesake, ""Manos."" When The Master leaves, his wives engage in further argument that soon degenerates into a fight, and the women wrestle in the sand.Torgo succumbs to what appears to be a hypnotic spell by The Master. The Master stops the fight, and has his first wife tied to a pole to be sacrificed. Torgo is laid on a stone bed, where he is attacked by The Master's other wives, but this in itself does not prove fatal. Evoking some mysterious power, The Master severs and horribly burns Torgo's left hand. Torgo runs off into the darkness, waving the burning stump that remains. The Master laughs maniacally and goes to look for the family and subsequently sacrifices his first wife.The family runs off into the desert. When a rattlesnake appears in front of them, Michael shoots it, attracting the attention of nearby deputies. Margaret and Michael are later convinced to return to the Master's house, where the Master welcomes them. Michael fires several shots into The Master's face at point-blank range, but they have no effect. The screen fades to black, likely indicating that The Master has again applied his hypnotic power.An undisclosed amount of time later, an entranced Michael greets two new lost travelers. Margaret and Debbie have become wives of The Master. The film concludes with Michael echoing Torgo's line of ""I take care of the place while the Master is away.""The production credits are superimposed over past scenes from the film with the words: ""The End?""","
    
                    A family driving through a small town gets lost and winds up at a backwoods shack managed by Torgo, who takes care of it while The Master is away.

When Torgo lets the family stay, The Master awakens and does mean stuff like burning off Torgo's hand and sicking his dog on the family pet. Meanwhile, The Master's wives wrestle for his favor.

    Synopsis
    While on a road trip near El Paso, Texas, Michael, Margaret, their young daughter Debbie, and their dog, Peppy, search for the ""Valley Lodge."" Michael and his family finally reach a house which is tended by the bizarre, satyr-like Torgo, who takes care of the house ""while the Master is away."" Michael and Margaret ask Torgo for directions to Valley Lodge; Torgo simply replies that there is no place like that around here. With this information, Michael asks Torgo to let him and his family stay the night, despite objections from both Torgo and Margaret.Inside the home, the family sees a disturbing painting of a dark, malevolent-looking man and a black dog with glowing eyes; the man it depicts is the Master. Margaret becomes frightened upon hearing an ominous howl; Michael investigates, retrieving a flashlight and revolver from his car, and later finds Peppy lying dead on the ground. Torgo reveals his attraction to Margaret and tells her that, although she is doomed to become yet another bride of The Master, he intends to keep her for himself. Margaret threatens to tell Michael of Torgo's advances, but Torgo convinces her not to say anything to her husband by promising to protect her. Michael returns, unable to start the car. With the revelation that there is no phone in the house, the family reluctantly decides to stay the night.Michael and Margaret stumble upon ""The Master"" and several women dressed in translucent nightgowns and later revealed to be his wives. They are all asleep. Torgo uses a stick to knock out Michael, and then ties Michael to a pole, after dragging him to it, and The Master suddenly comes to life. His wives also awaken, and a short argument over the fate of the family ensues. The Master decides he must sacrifice Torgo and his first wife to the film's mysterious deity and namesake, ""Manos."" When The Master leaves, his wives engage in further argument that soon degenerates into a fight, and the women wrestle in the sand.Torgo succumbs to what appears to be a hypnotic spell by The Master. The Master stops the fight, and has his first wife tied to a pole to be sacrificed. Torgo is laid on a stone bed, where he is attacked by The Master's other wives, but this in itself does not prove fatal. Evoking some mysterious power, The Master severs and horribly burns Torgo's left hand. Torgo runs off into the darkness, waving the burning stump that remains. The Master laughs maniacally and goes to look for the family and subsequently sacrifices his first wife.The family runs off into the desert. When a rattlesnake appears in front of them, Michael shoots it, attracting the attention of nearby deputies. Margaret and Michael are later convinced to return to the Master's house, where the Master welcomes them. Michael fires several shots into The Master's face at point-blank range, but they have no effect. The screen fades to black, likely indicating that The Master has again applied his hypnotic power.An undisclosed amount of time later, an entranced Michael greets two new lost travelers. Margaret and Debbie have become wives of The Master. The film concludes with Michael echoing Torgo's line of ""I take care of the place while the Master is away.""The production credits are superimposed over past scenes from the film with the words: ""The End?""

G. Armstrong).MacDonald has four boys and a girl. The whole family have worked real hard.Hung together through the rough times; now things were looking up, MacDonald was not ready to sell, so he's holding out and Jason was pushing, and now I'm standing right in the middle"".Saloon owner Maudie (Charlene Holt) walks in and throws her arms around Cole.She bursts out laughing when she realises that her old flame and her current one are friends.Cole gave her a stake some time earlier to help her sort out her money problems when her gambling husband was killed.Thornton goes off to Jason's ranch to tell him that he's not going to work for him.Warned that Thornton has gone to Jason's, MacDonald has left his youngest boy Luke out on the hills to do a man's job and look out.But whilst keeping watch,he falls asleep and when he wakes up he jumps and shoots down at Thornton.Instinctively Thornton shoots him down.Thornton rides to him and is upset to see the boy's age.He tries to make him feel comfortable but Luke is in agony.While Cole has his back turned to him,he pulls out his gun and kills himself.Thornton takes the body to Luke's father's place and explains what happened.Luke's sister, Joey (Michele Carey), a tomboyish,wild cat in buckskin pants doesn't believe him and tries to kill him.

men sitting at the table is Nelse Macleod (Christopher George),a dark thin faced man with a scar down the left side of his eye and cheek.Along with Cole and J.P he's one of the most dangerous gunslingers in the territory.Cole discovers that he's the latest gunslinger that Bart Jason has offered good money to work for him.Not only that but he also tells him that J.P won't be a threat because he's been an alcoholic for months.Cole and Mississippi get ready to walk out of the cantina,but Cole stops him.He knows Macleod will have some men waiting for them to shoot and he tells him to call the men off.Mississippi feeling grateful that he's saved his life twice,joins him for a meal.Cole soon finds out that Mississippi cannot shoot a all.He stops off at at an old friend's and gets him a shotgun to use.Cole and Mississippi arrive in El Dorado and stop off at Maudie's to find out if any strangers have been hanging around.She says no and she tells him the full extent of J.P's

to wake up J.P who's asleep in the cell.He throws some water over him to wake him up.J.P punches him and and Cole knocks him out with a pan to his head.Mississippi makes some special drink in order to keep him off the booze.With the black looking liquid in his system,any alcohol J.P drinks afterwards will just make him feel sick.The next afternoon,Bart Jason arrives in town and waits in the saloon for Nelse Macleod to turn up.At the same time,the Macdonald family arrive for their weekly town shopping.Bull goes off to keep an eye on the Macdonald's and tells Colt he'll blow on his trumpet if there's any trouble.Later at night,J.P gets up,looking for some alcohol.Cole tells him they've got rid of it all.J.P goes over to the saloon to get a bottle of whiskey and Bart and Macleod start laughing at him.He walks back in shame.Gunshots are heard and Bull blows the trumpet.Cole and Mississippi run out and find one of Macdonald's boys wounded.Cole,J.P,Mississippi and Bull search the town

over the face.He's ready to shoot him but Cole intervenes.J.P calms down and arrests him.As they are taking him to jail,Mississippi sees someone pointing a gun at them from the stable and goes to check it out.He grabs the person and sees it's a woman,in fact Joey,who was trying to get a shot at Bart for revenge.He takes her over to the jail to confirm that it's her.She asks J.P if Jason will get what he deserves.He says it's up to the judge.She thanks them for what they've done and leaves.Cole and Mississippi walk around the town on nightwatch and some of Jason's men come riding along.Mississippi dives into the street right in front of the horses hooves.The horses jump over him and he shoots one of the men.J.P comes running out of the office and takes a bullet in the leg.As Cole tends to his wound inside,he asks Mississippi why he dived under the horses and he tells him that you can't shoot properly while your horse is jumping in the air and an horse won't step on a person.The doctors are in the office removing the bullet from J.P's leg.They tell Cole that it would be a good idea for him to have the bullet removed from his back.Cole tells them if he survives all the trouble with Jason's men,he'll have it taken care of.J.P is feeling restless and frustrated and trying to control his need to drink.He comes up with the idea to lock themselves away in the office with some food and water until the U.S marshal arrives to pick Jason up.Bull recommends that he cleans himself up if they're going to be confined together.While J.P takes a bath,Joey and Maudie bring some things around for them to last them unil the marshal's arrival.Cole gets angry with her and tells her that it's best for her to stay away because Jason's men might use her to get Jason back from them.Later at night,a friend of Maudie's arrives with a note from Maudie saying that Macleod's men have been hanging around her place and that she's heard that they've got something planned.Cole and Mississippi go over to to the saloon but a gunman starts shooting at them.They chase him through the saloon,out to the back door.Two men tell them the person went out the back door.Mississipi

out.Milt doesn't want to but Cole shoots him in the arm and tell him to go.Milt says he lied,there's somebody out there.Cole shoots him in the leg.With no choice,Milt runs out of the doors shouting not to shoot but he is blown away.Cole tells Pedro to go next but as he is trying to force him out the doors,he starts suffering with the numbness down his arm again.He falls to the floor in pain.Pedro goes for his gun and Mississippi kills him but is knocked out from behind.Mississippi and Maudie go to the office through the back door to tell them what's happened.Macleod has Cole and wants to trade him for Jason.J.P reluctantly agrees.He frees Jason and he,Cole,bull and Mississppi flee town and hide out at his place.Bull is suspicious that Macleod let them get out of town too easily.Joey turns up to tell them that her brother Saul has been kidnapped by Jason and he will only be returned if the Macdonald ranch is handed over to him.With Bull's age,Mississippi's poor shooting skills and Cole and J.P's crippled condition,the odds are stacked against them.Cole realises he can still use a rifle with one hand so they hatch a plan.They ride back into town.Cole arrives on a wagon in front of the saloon to confront Macleod who has Jason and a few men at his side,while a few of the other men keep watch over Saul in the saloon.J.P,Mississippi and Bull go through the back door to get behind them.Bull fires an arrow into the back of one of Macleod's men and blows his bugle which distracts Macleod long enough for Cole to jump from the wagon and gun him down.J.P and Mississippi handle the rest of the men inside.Jason goes to grab one of Macleod's guns to kill Cole but Joey is hiding in the distance and shoots him first.Cole thanks her for saving his life.He walks

G. Armstrong).MacDonald has four boys and a girl. The whole family have worked real hard.Hung together through the rough times; now things were looking up, MacDonald was not ready to sell, so he's holding out and Jason was pushing, and now I'm standing right in the middle"".Saloon owner Maudie (Charlene Holt) walks in and throws her arms around Cole.She bursts out laughing when she realises that her old flame and her current one are friends.Cole gave her a stake some time earlier to help her sort out her money problems when her gambling husband was killed.Thornton goes off to Jason's ranch to tell him that he's not going to work for him.Warned that Thornton has gone to Jason's, MacDonald has left his youngest boy Luke out on the hills to do a man's job and look out.But whilst keeping watch,he falls asleep and when he wakes up he jumps and shoots down at Thornton.Instinctively Thornton shoots him down.Thornton rides to him and is upset to see the boy's age.He tries to make him feel comfortable but Luke is in agony.While Cole has his back turned to him,he pulls out his gun and kills himself.Thornton takes the body to Luke's father's place and explains what happened.Luke's sister, Joey (Michele Carey), a tomboyish,wild cat in buckskin pants doesn't believe him and tries to kill him. Her brother stops her and her father asks her to get in the house.But she angrily rides off.Macdonald thanks Cole for returning his boy but Cole feels guilty and rides off.On his way back,Joey ambushes Cole at a creek, dropping him with a rifle bullet. He manages to get back on his horse and escapes to Maudie's place, where Doc Miller (Paul Fix) treats him. The bullet is lodged dangerously close to his spine,but the elderly doctor says he's not equipped to deal with it and to find a better surgeon for the bullet's removal.After a short time,Thornton leaves El Dorado,much to Maudie's disappoinment.Several months later,Cole arrives in a town near the Mexican border and has dinner a the local cantina.A young man nicknamed Mississippi (James Caan) enters and confronts one of four men sitting at a dinner table, reminding him if he remembers him or if he remembers the black hat he is wearing? Mississippi's closest friend,mentor and father figure was accused of cheating at cards two year earlier and was killed.He says he caught up with the man's other three companions and he killed them all. He asks the last of the murderers to stand up.Mississippi isn't wearing a gun,Instead he kills the man with a knife.As one of the men tries to shoot him,Cole shoots his hand and steps in.One of the men sitting at the table is Nelse Macleod (Christopher George),a dark thin faced man with a scar down the left side of his eye and cheek.Along with Cole and J.P he's one of the most dangerous gunslingers in the territory.Cole discovers that he's the latest gunslinger that Bart Jason has offered good money to work for him.Not only that but he also tells him that J.P won't be a threat because he's been an alcoholic for months.Cole and Mississippi get ready to walk out of the cantina,but Cole stops him.He knows Macleod will have some men waiting for them to shoot and he tells him to call the men off.Mississippi feeling grateful that he's saved his life twice,joins him for a meal.Cole soon finds out that Mississippi cannot shoot a all.He stops off at at an old friend's and gets him a shotgun to use.Cole and Mississippi arrive in El Dorado and stop off at Maudie's to find out if any strangers have been hanging around.She says no and she tells him the full extent of J.P's alcoholism.Cole goes over to the sheriff's office with Mississippi and finds Bull on guard outside - who has been trying to keep law and order all on his own for the last few months.Cole goes inside to wake up J.P who's asleep in the cell.He throws some water over him to wake him up.J.P punches him and and Cole knocks him out with a pan to his head.Mississippi makes some special drink in order to keep him off the booze.With the black looking liquid in his system,any alcohol J.P drinks afterwards will just make him feel sick.The next afternoon,Bart Jason arrives in town and waits in the saloon for Nelse Macleod to turn up.At the same time,the Macdonald family arrive for their weekly town shopping.Bull goes off to keep an eye on the Macdonald's and tells Colt he'll blow on his trumpet if there's any trouble.Later at night,J.P gets up,looking for some alcohol.Cole tells him they've got rid of it all.J.P goes over to the saloon to get a bottle of whiskey and Bart and Macleod start laughing at him.He walks back in shame.Gunshots are heard and Bull blows the trumpet.Cole and Mississippi run out and find one of Macdonald's boys wounded.Cole,J.P,Mississippi and Bull search the town for the gunmen responsible.A woman comes to the window and tells Missisisppi that she saw a few men take off down the street towards he church.A gunfight breaks out and two of the men are killed but the man with the limp gets away.They follow him into Jason's saloon.JP is angry from the humilitating he had earlier and he wants to prove what he's made of.Everyone denies seeing a man enter but the pianist looks nervous.J.P tells him to get out of the way and begins firing his rifle at the piano.The gunman comes out from hiding and starts shooting but J.P kill him.The barman goes for a gun but J.P shoots the top of the bar and a load of wooden splinters go through his hand.J.P approaches the men who were laughing at him earlier.He hits one man in the stomach with the rifle and whacks Jason over the face.He's ready to shoot him but Cole intervenes.J.P calms down and arrests him.As they are taking him to jail,Mississippi sees someone pointing a gun at them from the stable and goes to check it out.He grabs the person and sees it's a woman,in fact Joey,who was trying to get a shot at Bart for revenge.He takes her over to the jail to confirm that it's her.She asks J.P if Jason will get what he deserves.He says it's up to the judge.She thanks them for what they've done and leaves.Cole and Mississippi walk around the town on nightwatch and some of Jason's men come riding along.Mississippi dives into the street right in front of the horses hooves.The horses jump over him and he shoots one of the men.J.P comes running out of the office and takes a bullet in the leg.As Cole tends to his wound inside,he asks Mississippi why he dived under the horses and he tells him that you can't shoot properly while your horse is jumping in the air and an horse won't step on a person.The doctors are in the office removing the bullet from J.P's leg.They tell Cole that it would be a good idea for him to have the bullet removed from his back.Cole tells them if he survives all the trouble with Jason's men,he'll have it taken care of.J.P is feeling restless and frustrated and trying to control his need to drink.He comes up with the idea to lock themselves away in the office with some food and water until the U.S marshal arrives to pick Jason up.Bull recommends that he cleans himself up if they're going to be confined together.While J.P takes a bath,Joey and Maudie bring some things around for them to last them unil the marshal's arrival.Cole gets angry with her and tells her that it's best for her to stay away because Jason's men might use her to get Jason back from them.Later at night,a friend of Maudie's arrives with a note from Maudie saying that Macleod's men have been hanging around her place and that she's heard that they've got something planned.Cole and Mississippi go over to to the saloon but a gunman starts shooting at them.They chase him through the saloon,out to the back door.Two men tell them the person went out the back door.Mississipi recognises the men as Milt and Pedro.Mississippi remembers the incident from their previous encounter.Cole asks if him anyone's waiting outside for them.Milt says no but Cole tells him to ealk out.Milt doesn't want to but Cole shoots him in the arm and tell him to go.Milt says he lied,there's somebody out there.Cole shoots him in the leg.With no choice,Milt runs out of the doors shouting not to shoot but he is blown away.Cole tells Pedro to go next but as he is trying to force him out the doors,he starts suffering with the numbness down his arm again.He falls to the floor in pain.Pedro goes for his gun and Mississippi kills him but is knocked out from behind.Mississippi and Maudie go to the office through the back door to tell them what's happened.Macleod has Cole and wants to trade him for Jason.J.P reluctantly agrees.He frees Jason and he,Cole,bull and Mississppi flee town and hide out at his place.Bull is suspicious that Macleod let them get out of town too easily.Joey turns up to tell them that her brother Saul has been kidnapped by Jason and he will only be returned if the Macdonald ranch is handed over to him.With Bull's age,Mississippi's poor shooting skills and Cole and J.P's crippled condition,the odds are stacked against them.Cole realises he can still use a rifle with one hand so they hatch a plan.They ride back into town.Cole arrives on a wagon in front of the saloon to confront Macleod who has Jason and a few men at his side,while a few of the other men keep watch over Saul in the saloon.J.P,Mississippi and Bull go through the back door to get behind them.Bull fires an arrow into the back of one of Macleod's men and blows his bugle which distracts Macleod long enough for Cole to jump from the wagon and gun him down.J.P and Mississippi handle the rest of the men inside.Jason goes to grab one of Macleod's guns to kill Cole but Joey is hiding in the distance and shoots him first.Cole thanks her for saving his life.He walks over to Macleod as he lays dying.He says to him ""You never gave me a chance at all did you"".Cole replies ""No I didn't.You're too good to give a chance to"".Macleod dies.The story ends as Cole has his leg wrapped up from scatter shot from Mississppi who accidentally caught him with his shotgun during he gunfight..Mississippi goes off to talk to Joey,Cole goes off to see Maudie and J.P and Bull have a drink while J.P tells him he needs him as his deputy.The story ends with Cole and J.P both now limping down the street as Cole prepares to leave town and J.P has gained his self respect back.

"17","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060522/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Paris, 1966...Monsieur Charles Bonnet (Hugh Griffin), the current head of the Bonnet family, custodian of the family's legendary collection of fine art, and a noted collector in his own right, is offering one of his prized paintings at auction. A Cezanne, it sells for a fabulous $515,000, the high point of the auction. When Bonnet's daughter, Nicole (Audrey Hepburn), hears the news on her car radio on her way home from work, she is shocked...and dismayed. The moment she arrives at their elegant old chateau, she runs upstairs calling her father. In his bedroom on the second floor, she opens the door to an antique wardrobe and steps inside, opens a false panel at the back of the wardrobe and climbs a hidden spiral staircase to her father's secret studio in the attic.Bonnet, it turns out, is a forger of fine art...cheerful and charming, but an unrepentant scoundrel. He is putting the finishing touches on his latest project, a flawless rendition of a famous lost Van Gogh. He has even found another painting from the same period, by an unknown artist, and has brushed dirt from the back of that canvas to transfer to his forgery. ""I doubt if even Van Gogh himself would have gone to such pains with his work,"" he boasts. ""He didn't have to, Papa,"" Nicole retorts, ""he WAS Van Gogh!"" She tells him in a tired voice (for what must surely be the thousandth time) that it's a crime to sell fake masterpieces. He replies that he only sells them to wealthy, private buyers, who get an undeniably fine painting in return.A noise in the driveway sends them both to the window: An armored car, a police van, a black limousine and half a dozen motorcycles have arrived and parked in front of the house. Nicole is terrified that the authorities have at last discovered Bonnet's hobby, but Bonnet explains that he has simply agreed to let the Claver-Lafayette Museum display their exquisite statuette of Venus, purportedly carved by 16th Century sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, in their latest exhibit. Nicole is not reassured: Their Cellini Venus is also a forgery...carved at the end of the 19th century by Bonnet's father, using Bonnet's mother as a model. Unlike paintings, she tells her father, it's an easy matter to detect forged sculptures. Bonnet brushes aside her concerns: since he's merely lending the statue, not selling it, there will be no reason to test its authenticity.He runs downstairs (followed closely by Nicole) to greet Monsieur Grammont (Ferdinand Gravey), the museum director, who is here with his assistants and an armed escort to transport the Venus. Bonnet shows him into the library, where the Venus stands in solitary splendor in its own special niche. Grammont is moved almost to tears by the sight of it...he congratulates Bonnet for keeping this fine piece in France, though he must have had many lucrative offers to buy it. Bonnet smiles modestly, and says, ""Well, after all, one is still a Frenchman."" The Venus is handed over, secured in a heavily padded case, Grammont thanks Bonnet effusively and leaves. Bonnet is jubilant, but Nicole is still worried. He waves off her concern, saying that her basic trouble is that she's honest....""but I don't tell you that to hurt your feelings,"" he adds kindly. ""I get dizzy spells when we have these conversations, Papa,"" she complains. He invites her to attend the gala opening at the museum that night...she firmly declines.The Cellini Venus is the star of the exhibit, and Bonnet the most celebrated guest at the gala. Davis Leland (Eli Wallach), a wealthy American industrialist, is also present. He has recently taken up art collecting, and is pursuing it as obssessively as he pursued the acquisition of his millions. He is so taken with the Venus that he determines to find out all about Bonnet and his family...with the goal of somehow acquiring the Venus.The Bonnet chateau is dark and quiet...the only inhabitant is Nicole, lying upstairs on her bed in her nightie, engrossed in a lurid paperback mystery. Downstairs an intruder has gained entry, and is quietly creeping around the main floor, looking over all the paintings with a small flashlight. He stops when he finds Bonnet's new Van Gogh, takes it down from the wall, and chips off a minute particle of the paint. He tucks it into a little plastic envelope, and stows it in his pocket. He then starts to examine the painting, carefully. But he makes a slight noise, which Nicole hears upstairs, and she comes down to investigate. She gets halfway down the staircase, sees the intruder, and stifles a scream. Then she plucks up her courage and takes an antique duelling pistol from a display on the wall. She makes her way to the bottom of the stairs, levels the pistol in his direction and turns on the lights.Startled, holding the Van Gogh in front of himself like a shield, the burglar whirls around to face her. He (Peter O'Toole) is no ordinary burglar: he's tall, slim, blue-eyed, handsome, and very distinguished-looking in a dinner jacket. ""Don't move,"" she tells him, ""Put that painting down."" He does so, and she starts to call the police. Then she notices which painting he was holding. ""Why...did you choose that particular painting?"" she asks, uneasily. ""It was the handiest,"" he replies, promptly. He sees her hesitation, and decides to press his luck, a bit. ""Look..."" he says, ""don't call the police. Give me another chance. You see, I was only taking one painting...and you have so many...chances are you wouldn't even have noticed."" ""Don't be impudent,"" she scolds. But she can't afford to have official attention drawn toward her father's latest forgery. He puts the painting back, and she puts the phone down. ""Well, I don't know why,"" she says, ""but I'm going to let you go."" She sets the pistol down on the phone table, and as she does so it goes off, terrifying them both and grazing the burglar's arm. They both faint. He revives first, pats her cheek, fans her face with his coat tail, and when she awakens, he points out that he's the one who's bleeding.She takes him to the kitchen, pours him a drink and bandages his arm. He complains about the wound and the doctoring, even though it's only a minor scratch. ""For a burglar, you're not very brave,"" she remarks. ""I'm a society burglar,"" he retorts, ""I don't expect people to rush about shooting me."" She finishes patching him up, and tells him he is free to go. He continues to push her, though, as if he's trying to see how far he can go before she finally loses patience and calls the police. He tells her he won't be able to drive home, with his wounded arm. Exasperated, she offers to call a cab...and pay for it. He points out that his car is outside her house, and the police may ask questions...and after all, he is wanted. She finally agrees to drive him home, and while she's pulling on her boots, and putting a coat on over her nightie, he asks her for a cigarette...and then a match...all while openly admiring her legs.They jump into his little yellow Jaguar, and she drives him to the Hotel Ritz (""You're a very chic burglar,"" she grumbles). Then she realizes she's on foot, in her nightie, in downtown Paris, in the middle of the night...with no way of getting home herself. He has the doorman wave down a taxi for her, and while it's turning around, he asks her for a final favor. ""Like an idiot,"" he says, ""I forgot to wear gloves. Would you just give the edge of the painting a quick wipe with a clean cloth, when you get home?"" She stares at him in disbelief. ""Oh, you're mad,"" she says. ""I suppose next you'll want a goodnight kiss."" ""Well, I don't, usually, on the first acquaintance,"" he replies, ""but you've been such a good sport...."" And he lays a lovely one on her that leaves her stunned and speechless. He puts her gently in the cab, bids her good night, and waves as they drive off. Simon Dermott, ""society burglar"", hurries upstairs to his room, takes out the tiny spot of paint he chipped from the Van Gogh, and examines it with a set of jeweler's glasses. He lights a cigarette, thinking...and smiles, remembering.Bonnet is at home pouring a glass of champagne when Nicole walks in. He starts to tell her of the gala...she interrupts and tells him about the burglar she caught. He quickly grasps the implications of what might have happened had she called the police, and assures her she did the right thing in letting the burglar go. Still somewhat dazed, she starts up to bed, then pauses...she takes Bonnet's handkerchief from his pocket, wipes the edge of the painting with it, and tucks it back into Bonnet's pocket, while he watches, a little bewildered. She starts back up the stairs, and he asks her, uneasily, ""This tall, good-looking ruffian...he didn't molest you in any way, did he?"" She stops, considers, then replies softly, ""Not much,"" and continues on up to bed.Next day she goes to the museum to see the Venus in the exhibit for herself. She turns to leave, and almost bumps into Simon Dermott. Startled and indignant, she is trying to get rid of him when Monsieur Grammont sees her, and comes over to greet her. Simon horns in, introducing himself as an old shooting partner of Miss Bonnet's. Monsieur Grammont offers to tell her about the special security arrangements they've made. Nicole tries to disengage, but Simon expresses interest, so Monsieur Grammont launches into an explanation. The little statue stands on a marble pedestal, with a circuit of infrared beams surrounding her. If anyone tries to reach through the invisible barrier to grab her, an alarm sounds, and both museum security and police respond. Simon wants to linger and hear more, but Nicole drags him away, out of the museum. Outside she tells him to go away, and leave her alone. He tries to talk to her, but she speeds off in her little car so quickly he spins around and almost falls in the street.Simon arrives at the office of Monsieur Bernard Desolnay (Charles Boyer), a well-known and reputable dealer of fine art. Desolnay greets him with enthusiasm, and asks if he had a chance to go to Bonnet's home and look at the Van Gogh. Simon nodds, and Desolnay says, ""And it bothers you, doesn't it?"" ""Not a bit,"" replies Simon, ""it's a great Van Gogh."" ""Of course it is,"" agrees Desolnay readily, ""But who painted it?"" It develops that Desolnay has suspected Bonnet for some time. Simon points out that he has a statue worth a million dollars on exhibit...he certainly doesn't need the money. Desolnay speculates that it has more to do with ego: Bonnet studied painting as a young man, and like many art students, copied the Old Masters to learn their secrets. In the process he must have learned that he could imitate them perfectly, and now he enjoys fooling the world. Simon wonders idly if Nicole is in it with him. Desolnay replies, ""In what? According to you there's nothing."" ""Oh, that's right,"" says Simon, catching himself. ""Well, you're wrong, you'll see,"" declares Desolnay.Later, Bonnet enters Nicole's bedroom, and asks about her plans for the evening. She tells him she has a date with Davis Leland, an American tycoon she met that day. Bonnet is surprised and interested. He tells her that Leland once bought a Toulouse Lautrec painting from him. ""Your Lautrec or Lautrec's Lautrec?"" she asks, warily. ""Mine, of course,"" he chuckles. Nicole is instantly uneasy again: Not only had Davis not mentioned that fact, but he had behaved as though he'd never heard of her father, and had no interest in art at all. She fears he must be up to something...or suspects something.They dine at an upscale restaurant. Davis is quite taken with Nicole...he sometimes has trouble relating to women, he tells her...but she's just like a member of the board. He's called to the phone, and as soon as he's out of sight, Simon (who apparently had him paged) sits down at the table. She is suitably annoyed, but he tells her he must talk to her, and gives her his room number at the Ritz. Then he leaves, and Davis returns. Davis finally admits to Nicole that he arranged their meeting because of his interest in the Cellini Venus, and hoped she could help him acquire it. Relieved, she kisses him, and tells him it's not for sale...but if it was hers to sell, it would be his in a heartbeat.Next morning, she tells her father of the exchange, and they share a short-lived moment of relief. The butler (Bert Bertram) announces that a representative from the museum (Eddie Malin) has arrived. It seems that the museum has arranged to insure the Venus against damage or theft while it's on exhibit. Monsieur Grammont was supposed to have gotten Bonnet's signature on an insurance form the day he picked it up, but had neglected to do so, and he is here to correct the oversight. When Bonnet has signed the papers, the representative asks if he'd like to be present at the technical examination, which he has just authorized. ""Technical...examination?"" Nicole and Bonnet ask in unison, dumbfounded. ""Yes,"" replies the representative. ""A mere formality, of course...It will take place on Friday, and you have the right to be present."" He leaves, unaware of the bomb he has dropped on their world.The myth of the Bonnet collection is about to be exploded. Once the Venus is exposed as a forgery, anything else that has been bought, owned or sold by Bonnet will be tested and retested until every forged piece is brought to light. Bonnet urges Nicole to leave the country and let him face the scandal alone. But she refuses, determined to stand by him, and as she comforts him, an idea occurs to her. She asks him for the number of the Hotel Ritz.Simon enters the bar at the Ritz, and walks right by Nicole, who is ""disguised"" in a black lace cocktail dress and a little black pillbox hat, with black net veil and domino-style mask attached. She ""Pssst's"" at him, and motions him back to her table. He's astonished by her odd appearance and behavior...and stunned when she asks him to help her steal the Venus. He wants to know why, but she steadfastly refuses to tell him, and at first, he emphatically refuses. But she is so heartbroken, so desperate (and so lovely), he can't bring himself to refuse her out of hand. He tells her he'll sleep on it. They agree to meet the next day to talk it over.Next day, they drive to the museum...he points out that there is a formidable presence of museum guards, and even more guards at the homes of the Minister of the Interior and the President, across the street. They go inside, and as he studies the security set-up, he notices a resemblance between Nicole and the Venus. ""Where were you in the middle of the 15th Century?"" he asks. ""I don't know,"" she retorts, ""but that's not how I was dressed,"" gesturing at the nude statue. He continues his reconnaissance. He notes that parcels are not permitted in the museum: they must be left at a desk in the lobby, but they are not searched...that there is a tapestry hanging on a frame in front of a fireplace...that there is a small utility closet at the bottom of the main staircase, the door of which is locked, but the key is kept on a hook at the back of the staircase. Exploring, he finds the guards' room, and goes inside. Posing as an official from the Ministry of Tourism, and asking indignant questions under the pretense that his sleeve became smeared with dust in the museum, he learns that the cleaning people come in every night at midnight. On his way out, he deliberately chooses the wrong door, and sees that it leads to the basement, and a possible alternate exit.They go for a walk in a nearby park. He sees a child's toy being demonstrated, a balsa-wood boomerang that soars in a circle, then returns to the thrower. He buys two. They stop at a second-hand shop, for a scrubwoman's outfit, and a plastic mop bucket. When they go back to his room at the Ritz, he tells Nicole to change into the clothes. Tired of following him on endless and seemingly unrelated errands, irritated at having no explanation as to what he is thinking, Nicole asks him suspiciously if they're planning the same sort of crime. Nevertheless, she puts on the clothes, and he starts to tell her what will happen at midnight in the museum. ""You DO have a plan, don't you!"" she exclaims, excited. ""Yes,"" he replies evenly. ""My plan is that I will be lying here in my bed with a good book, unless you tell me what this is all about."" She's surprised and crestfallen...but she can't explain, so he tells her she must go. Tears fill her eyes, and he angrily tells her they won't change his mind. He orders her back into the bathroom to change out of the clothes, and leave. As she turns dejectedly to do so, against his better judgment, he tells her to meet him at the museum just before closing the following day. Overjoyed, she agrees, and almost skips into the bathroom. Simon hits himself in the head with the plastic mop bucket.Next evening, just as Nicole is preparing to leave for the museum, Davis Leland turns up at her house with an enormous diamond ring, and in a very efficient and business-like manner, asks her to marry him. Afraid that refusing him will mean argument and delay, she takes the ring and dashes away, arriving at the museum only a few minutes late. Simon is impatient and irritated...she explains to him that she was getting engaged, and he retorts that they still have a little time if she'd like to go back and marry the man.They check the parcel of clothes at the desk, and go on into the museum. He checks on the closet, and quickly unlocks the door. Then he takes a handful of coins, and puts them in a brochure, and places the brochure precariously on the edge of a statue's pedestal. ""Watch for normal human reactions,"" he says to Nicole, and they move over by the fireplace. A guard picks up the brochure, and the coins scatter...several people bend down to pick them up, while many others watch. Simon and Nicole use the distraction to duck into the fireplace behind the tapestry. The museum closes and as the guards escort the other patrons out, they slip down the stairs and into the tiny closet. The guards return and make a round of all the floors. One of the guards finds the closet unlocked, gives it a cursory inspection (slim Nicole and slim Simon have both squeezed into a tiny shelf area), then locks the door and returns the key to the outside panel. Nicole panics, but Simon is unconcerned. They wait for an hour in the tiny closet. Then they hear the guards come out of their room, and tramp all over the museum again as they make their rounds. Simon is pleased: now he knows the schedule.Using a powerful magnet against the wall at the back of the closet, he is able to remove the key from its hook, ""walk"" it around the outside of the closet, and bring it inside under the door. With a specially-fitted tube, a hook, and another small magnet, he's able to draw the key up into the keyhole, and open the door. He runs to the front desk, grabs the clothes and runs back to the closet. He helps Nicole to put the clothes on over her own clothes, then he takes out and assembles one of the little boomerangs he'd bought the day before. Exasperated at the close quarters (""I hadn't counted on there being so much togetherness,"" she grumbles) and all the elaborate preparations, Nicole asks when they're finally going to steal the Venus. He tells her that one of the nice things about complicated mechanical systems is that they malfunction, and when that happens, you can always rely on normal human reactions. He asks her how she would feel if she was one of these guards, assigned to look out for a bunch of stuff she couldn't afford, and wasn't interested in, night after night. ""Irritated,"" she replies, wearily. ""Exactly,"" he says, and steps out of the closet onto the stairway.His first throw goes wide...but his second breaks the beam on the electric field surrounding the Venus, and a deafening alarm goes off. He grabs the returning boomerang and Nicole, and they both run back to the closet. The guards pour out of their room, and swarm all over the museum, and when the police arrive, they search as well. It's eventually determined that the alarm was false. The Minister of the Interior calls to complain about the noise from across the street. The head guard (Jacques Marin), a short, serious man, looks disgusted. ""A burglar alarm especially designed to give me heartburn,"" he mutters, as he resets it.Nicole realizes, for the first time, what a difficult and dangerous task they've undertaken. She tells Simon she wouldn't blame him if he left. ""Then what happens tomorrow when they test your million dollar baby?"" he asks quietly. She stares at him. ""It's a fake, isn't it,"" he says. She nods slowly, and asks how long he's known, and he answers: ""Since you first asked me to steal it."" She asks why he'd help if he knew...he leans in and kisses her gently, and she whispers, ""That's why,"" in wonder. ""Oh, I'm so stupid,"" she says, putting her arms around his neck. ""Please...explain it to me again!""After more ""explanation"", he goes out to set off the alarm a second time. Again, the lights go on, the guards gallop all over the museum, and the police arrive to assist...again, they find nothing. This time, it is ""His Excellency"" himself who calls up from across the street to complain. The head guard is properly intimidated. He doesn't reset the alarm...he turns it off.Simon is stunned to find that his plan has worked. Nevertheless, he pulls himself together, and attends to business. He goes up the stairs and takes the Venus, and conceals it in the bucket. He tells Nicole to hide in the fireplace again, and when the scrubwomen arrive, to come out on her hands and knees, scrubbing madly, and no matter whatever else happens to work her way back to the guard's room. ""The guards' room?"" she asks. ""When they discover the Venus is gone, there will be guards everywhere but in the guards' room,"" he says, and tells her to hang onto her bucket.At midnight, the scrubwomen arrive, and set to work. The guards also come out, and start rounds. It is several minutes before a guard (Mustache) notices that the Venus is gone. He points it out to the head guard, who is shocked insensible for a long moment. Then he hoarsely cries, ""Alarm!"" --and all hell breaks loose, with guards running every which way, bumping into each other, and stumbling over scrubwomen. It is a few moments more before the head guard realizes that the alarm is not sounding...because it has been turned off. He quickly turns it on again, but it is still silent. Mustache finally reaches through the beam, and the alarm goes off, adding to the bedlam.Nicole has worked her way to the guard room, and goes inside. One of the guards is there, sitting in a chair, reading a newspaper. She turns to flee, but he grabs her and kisses her...it's Simon. They leave quietly down the basement stairs.Reporters gather at Bonnet's house next morning, to take pictures of the empty niche, and ask him how he feels about the loss of his precious statue. He plays his feigned grief to the hilt. Upstairs, Nicole is chatting excitedly with Simon about the caper on the phone, and they arrange to meet later at the Ritz bar. The reporters leave, and Nichol runs downstairs, and she and her father hug joyously in their relief. He offers to take her out to celebrate, but she tells him she has an appointment later, at the Ritz. She runs back upstairs, and he repeats, ""The Ritz,"" looking thoughtful.Davis Leland has come to Monsieur Desolnay's office, in a state of extreme excitement. He wants to try and find the Venus, and purchase it...at any price...no questions asked. Desolnay implores him not to pursue it, but finally gives him the name of someone he thinks may be able to help: Simon Dermott, currently staying at the Ritz.They meet at the bar in the Ritz, and Simon tells Davis that he already has a few feelers out...just idle curiosity...and he believes he knows who might be responsible. He warns Davis he'll be buying something that he will never be able to show, or even to acknowledge that he owns. Davis is undeterred. Simon asks if Davis is acquainted with any member of the Bonnet familly, and Davis admits he's engaged to Bonnet's daughter. Simon tells him that if he wants the Venus, he'll have to give her up...that if he doesn't, the people who have the Venus will suspect a trap and he'll never be able to acquire it. Reluctantly, Davis agrees. Simon says he'll be in touch, and Davis starts to leave the bar...just as Nicole arrives. As Simon watches, amused, Davis almost breaks a leg avoiding her, when she's only trying to return his ring.She sits down next to Simon, and begins to chatter about how thrilling the theft had been, for her first effort. ""It was my first, too,"" he remarks. This admission stops her in mid-sentence. She asks, puzzled, ""Then you're not a burglar?"" He shakes his head. ""Who are you?"" she asks, filled with sudden foreboding. ""I'm a private consultant who specializes in museum security,"" he says, deliberately. ""I have advanced degrees in art history, chemistry and criminology. I also specialize in tracing and recovering stolen works of art, and in detecting and exposing forgeries."" She is so startled and dismayed she almost falls out of the booth. But he catches her, and at that moment Bonnet himself arrives, having correctly deduced the nature of Nicole's appointment. After Nicole introduces them, he asks what Simon intends to do. Simon replies that Bonnet has two gorgeous girls in his family...and he intends to keep the real one. But he has plans for the other girl as well, and he must leave now to make arrangements. After his departure, Nicole lets out a shocked little scream: Davis Leland's huge diamond ring is gone, too!Simon meets Davis at the airport, preparing to take off in his private jet. He hands Davis a crate, and tells him that he'll be contacted later for payment: the code word will be ""togetherness"". Davis takes the crate into the jet, and hurries directly to the restroom, where he can be alone. There, he opens the crate, removes the packing and reveals the Venus, in all its illicit splendor. Then, to his wonder, he notices that the diamond ring he gave to Nicole is tied with a bit of ribbon around the Venus's neck.Bonnet is delighted...Davis is the only collector who will never dare to have the statue tested. He asks, rather tentatively, about the money Simon got for the piece...Simon says he asked a nice round figure, and traces a large zero in the air with his index finger. ""You, sir, are a forger,"" he says. ""It's my job to catch forgers. One of us has to retire."" ""Fair enough,"" says Bonnet, ""Shall we flip a coin?"" ""I already did,"" replies Simon, ""You lost."" Bonnet struggles with himself for a moment, then extends his hand to seal the bargain.Nicole and Simon are leaving France...they'll lie low for a while in England, and get married there. As they drive through Bonnet's front gate, another car passes them on the way in...a Senor Paravideo (Marcel Dalio) who has long been trying to get hold of one of Bonnet's paintings. Simon stops the little yellow Jag, and he and Nicole turn to watch. Bonnet greets Paravideo with delight, and shows him inside. ""Who's that?"" asks Simon, pointedly. Nicole's hesitation is very brief: ""Papa's cousin,"" she replies, innocently, ""from South America."" He looks at her for a long time, then remarks, ""For someone who only started lying recently, you're showing a real flair for it."" ""Oh, thank you!"" she says, smiling radiantly. And they're off. And they all live happily ever after!","
    
                    Nicole's father, a legendary art collector, lends his prized Cellini Venus to a prestigious Paris museum. Unfortunately, the Venus was *not* sculpted by Cellini but by Nicole's grandfather. (Her father is a forger as well, but his specialty is paintings.) Before tests can be done which would prove the Venus a fake, Nicole enlists the services of ""society burglar"" Simon Demott to steal the million dollar statue.

Later, Nicole surprises a tuxedo-clad burglar in her father's workshop. She can't call the police because her father's hobby might be discovered, so she ends up driving the man--Simon Dermott--back to his hotel. Dermott is actually an inspector who is gathering evidence against Bonnet, but his attraction to Nicole complicates the assignment. Nicole learns that the museum plans to conduct a test on the Venus for insurance purposes, which she knows will expose the statue as a fake. To save her father from jail, she asks Simon to steal it, unaware of his true identity. Simon, intrigued by the challenge and now smitten with Miss Bonnet, agrees to the proposal.

    Synopsis
    Paris, 1966...Monsieur Charles Bonnet (Hugh Griffin), the current head of the Bonnet family, custodian of the family's legendary collection of fine art, and a noted collector in his own right, is offering one of his prized paintings at auction. A Cezanne, it sells for a fabulous $515,000, the high point of the auction. When Bonnet's daughter, Nicole (Audrey Hepburn), hears the news on her car radio on her way home from work, she is shocked...and dismayed. The moment she arrives at their elegant old chateau, she runs upstairs calling her father. In his bedroom on the second floor, she opens the door to an antique wardrobe and steps inside, opens a false panel at the back of the wardrobe and climbs a hidden spiral staircase to her father's secret studio in the attic.Bonnet, it turns out, is a forger of fine art...cheerful and charming, but an unrepentant scoundrel. He is putting the finishing touches on his latest project, a flawless rendition of a famous lost Van Gogh. He has even found another painting from the same period, by an unknown artist, and has brushed dirt from the back of that canvas to transfer to his forgery. ""I doubt if even Van Gogh himself would have gone to such pains with his work,"" he boasts. ""He didn't have to, Papa,"" Nicole retorts, ""he WAS Van Gogh!"" She tells him in a tired voice (for what must surely be the thousandth time) that it's a crime to sell fake masterpieces. He replies that he only sells them to wealthy, private buyers, who get an undeniably fine painting in return.A noise in the driveway sends them both to the window: An armored car, a police van, a black limousine and half a dozen motorcycles have arrived and parked in front of the house. Nicole is terrified that the authorities have at last discovered Bonnet's hobby, but Bonnet explains that he has simply agreed to let the Claver-Lafayette Museum display their exquisite statuette of Venus, purportedly carved by 16th Century sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, in their latest exhibit. Nicole is not reassured: Their Cellini Venus is also a forgery...carved at the end of the 19th century by Bonnet's father, using Bonnet's mother as a model. Unlike paintings, she tells her father, it's an easy matter to detect forged sculptures. Bonnet brushes aside her concerns: since he's merely lending the statue, not selling it, there will be no reason to test its authenticity.He runs downstairs (followed closely by Nicole) to greet Monsieur Grammont (Ferdinand Gravey), the museum director, who is here with his assistants and an armed escort to transport the Venus. Bonnet shows him into the library, where the Venus stands in solitary splendor in its own special niche. Grammont is moved almost to tears by the sight of it...he congratulates Bonnet for keeping this fine piece in France, though he must have had many lucrative offers to buy it. Bonnet smiles modestly, and says, ""Well, after all, one is still a Frenchman."" The Venus is handed over, secured in a heavily padded case, Grammont thanks Bonnet effusively and leaves. Bonnet is jubilant, but Nicole is still worried. He waves off her concern, saying that her basic trouble is that she's honest....""but I don't tell you that to hurt your feelings,"" he adds kindly. ""I get dizzy spells when we have these conversations, Papa,"" she complains. He invites her to attend the gala opening at the museum that night...she firmly declines.The Cellini Venus is the star of the exhibit, and Bonnet the most celebrated guest at the gala. Davis Leland (Eli Wallach), a wealthy American industrialist, is also present. He has recently taken up art collecting, and is pursuing it as obssessively as he pursued the acquisition of his millions. He is so taken with the Venus that he determines to find out all about Bonnet and his family...with the goal of somehow acquiring the Venus.The Bonnet chateau is dark and quiet...the only inhabitant is Nicole, lying upstairs on her bed in her nightie, engrossed in a lurid paperback mystery. Downstairs an intruder has gained entry, and is quietly creeping around the main floor, looking over all the paintings with a small flashlight. He stops when he finds Bonnet's new Van Gogh, takes it down from the wall, and chips off a minute particle of the paint. He tucks it into a little plastic envelope, and stows it in his pocket. He then starts to examine the painting, carefully. But he makes a slight noise, which Nicole hears upstairs, and she comes down to investigate. She gets halfway down the staircase, sees the intruder, and stifles a scream. Then she plucks up her courage and takes an antique duelling pistol from a display on the wall. She makes her way to the bottom of the stairs, levels the pistol in his direction and turns on the lights.Startled, holding the Van Gogh in front of himself like a shield, the burglar whirls around to face her. He (Peter O'Toole) is no ordinary burglar: he's tall, slim, blue-eyed, handsome, and very distinguished-looking in a dinner jacket. ""Don't move,"" she tells him, ""Put that painting down."" He does so, and she starts to call the police. Then she notices which painting he was holding. ""Why...did you choose that particular painting?"" she asks, uneasily. ""It was the handiest,"" he replies, promptly. He sees her hesitation, and decides to press his luck, a bit. ""Look..."" he says, ""don't call the police. Give me another chance. You see, I was only taking one painting...and you have so many...chances are you wouldn't even have noticed."" ""Don't be impudent,"" she scolds. But she can't afford to have official attention drawn toward her father's latest forgery. He puts the painting back, and she puts the phone down. ""Well, I don't know why,"" she says, ""but I'm going to let you go."" She sets the pistol down on the phone table, and as she does so it goes off, terrifying them both and grazing the burglar's arm. They both faint. He revives first, pats her cheek, fans her face with his coat tail, and when she awakens, he points out that he's the one who's bleeding.She takes him to the kitchen, pours him a drink and bandages his arm. He complains about the wound and the doctoring, even though it's only a minor scratch. ""For a burglar, you're not very brave,"" she remarks. ""I'm a society burglar,"" he retorts, ""I don't expect people to rush about shooting me."" She finishes patching him up, and tells him he is free to go. He continues to push her, though, as if he's trying to see how far he can go before she finally loses patience and calls the police. He tells her he won't be able to drive home, with his wounded arm. Exasperated, she offers to call a cab...and pay for it. He points out that his car is outside her house, and the police may ask questions...and after all, he is wanted. She finally agrees to drive him home, and while she's pulling on her boots, and putting a coat on over her nightie, he asks her for a cigarette...and then a match...all while openly admiring her legs.They jump into his little yellow Jaguar, and she drives him to the Hotel Ritz (""You're a very chic burglar,"" she grumbles). Then she realizes she's on foot, in her nightie, in downtown Paris, in the middle of the night...with no way of getting home herself. He has the doorman wave down a taxi for her, and while it's turning around, he asks her for a final favor. ""Like an idiot,"" he says, ""I forgot to wear gloves. Would you just give the edge of the painting a quick wipe with a clean cloth, when you get home?"" She stares at him in disbelief. ""Oh, you're mad,"" she says. ""I suppose next you'll want a goodnight kiss."" ""Well, I don't, usually, on the first acquaintance,"" he replies, ""but you've been such a good sport...."" And he lays a lovely one on her that leaves her stunned and speechless. He puts her gently in the cab, bids her good night, and waves as they drive off. Simon Dermott, ""society burglar"", hurries upstairs to his room, takes out the tiny spot of paint he chipped from the Van Gogh, and examines it with a set of jeweler's glasses. He lights a cigarette, thinking...and smiles, remembering.Bonnet is at home pouring a glass of champagne when Nicole walks in. He starts to tell her of the gala...she interrupts and tells him about the burglar she caught. He quickly grasps the implications of what might have happened had she called the police, and assures her she did the right thing in letting the burglar go. Still somewhat dazed, she starts up to bed, then pauses...she takes Bonnet's handkerchief from his pocket, wipes the edge of the painting with it, and tucks it back into Bonnet's pocket, while he watches, a little bewildered. She starts back up the stairs, and he asks her, uneasily, ""This tall, good-looking ruffian...he didn't molest you in any way, did he?"" She stops, considers, then replies softly, ""Not much,"" and continues on up to bed.Next day she goes to the museum to see the Venus in the exhibit for herself. She turns to leave, and almost bumps into Simon Dermott. Startled and indignant, she is trying to get rid of him when Monsieur Grammont sees her, and comes over to greet her. Simon horns in, introducing himself as an old shooting partner of Miss Bonnet's. Monsieur Grammont offers to tell her about the special security arrangements they've made. Nicole tries to disengage, but Simon expresses interest, so Monsieur Grammont launches into an explanation. The little statue stands on a marble pedestal, with a circuit of infrared beams surrounding her. If anyone tries to reach through the invisible barrier to grab her, an alarm sounds, and both museum security and police respond. Simon wants to linger and hear more, but Nicole drags him away, out of the museum. Outside she tells him to go away, and leave her alone. He tries to talk to her, but she speeds off in her little car so quickly he spins around and almost falls in the street.Simon arrives at the office of Monsieur Bernard Desolnay (Charles Boyer), a well-known and reputable dealer of fine art. Desolnay greets him with enthusiasm, and asks if he had a chance to go to Bonnet's home and look at the Van Gogh. Simon nodds, and Desolnay says, ""And it bothers you, doesn't it?"" ""Not a bit,"" replies Simon, ""it's a great Van Gogh."" ""Of course it is,"" agrees Desolnay readily, ""But who painted it?"" It develops that Desolnay has suspected Bonnet for some time. Simon points out that he has a statue worth a million dollars on exhibit...he certainly doesn't need the money. Desolnay speculates that it has more to do with ego: Bonnet studied painting as a young man, and like many art students, copied the Old Masters to learn their secrets. In the process he must have learned that he could imitate them perfectly, and now he enjoys fooling the world. Simon wonders idly if Nicole is in it with him. Desolnay replies, ""In what? According to you there's nothing."" ""Oh, that's right,"" says Simon, catching himself. ""Well, you're wrong, you'll see,"" declares Desolnay.Later, Bonnet enters Nicole's bedroom, and asks about her plans for the evening. She tells him she has a date with Davis Leland, an American tycoon she met that day. Bonnet is surprised and interested. He tells her that Leland once bought a Toulouse Lautrec painting from him. ""Your Lautrec or Lautrec's Lautrec?"" she asks, warily. ""Mine, of course,"" he chuckles. Nicole is instantly uneasy again: Not only had Davis not mentioned that fact, but he had behaved as though he'd never heard of her father, and had no interest in art at all. She fears he must be up to something...or suspects something.They dine at an upscale restaurant. Davis is quite taken with Nicole...he sometimes has trouble relating to women, he tells her...but she's just like a member of the board. He's called to the phone, and as soon as he's out of sight, Simon (who apparently had him paged) sits down at the table. She is suitably annoyed, but he tells her he must talk to her, and gives her his room number at the Ritz. Then he leaves, and Davis returns. Davis finally admits to Nicole that he arranged their meeting because of his interest in the Cellini Venus, and hoped she could help him acquire it. Relieved, she kisses him, and tells him it's not for sale...but if it was hers to sell, it would be his in a heartbeat.Next morning, she tells her father of the exchange, and they share a short-lived moment of relief. The butler (Bert Bertram) announces that a representative from the museum (Eddie Malin) has arrived. It seems that the museum has arranged to insure the Venus against damage or theft while it's on exhibit. Monsieur Grammont was supposed to have gotten Bonnet's signature on an insurance form the day he picked it up, but had neglected to do so, and he is here to correct the oversight. When Bonnet has signed the papers, the representative asks if he'd like to be present at the technical examination, which he has just authorized. ""Technical...examination?"" Nicole and Bonnet ask in unison, dumbfounded. ""Yes,"" replies the representative. ""A mere formality, of course...It will take place on Friday, and you have the right to be present."" He leaves, unaware of the bomb he has dropped on their world.The myth of the Bonnet collection is about to be exploded. Once the Venus is exposed as a forgery, anything else that has been bought, owned or sold by Bonnet will be tested and retested until every forged piece is brought to light. Bonnet urges Nicole to leave the country and let him face the scandal alone. But she refuses, determined to stand by him, and as she comforts him, an idea occurs to her. She asks him for the number of the Hotel Ritz.Simon enters the bar at the Ritz, and walks right by Nicole, who is ""disguised"" in a black lace cocktail dress and a little black pillbox hat, with black net veil and domino-style mask attached. She ""Pssst's"" at him, and motions him back to her table. He's astonished by her odd appearance and behavior...and stunned when she asks him to help her steal the Venus. He wants to know why, but she steadfastly refuses to tell him, and at first, he emphatically refuses. But she is so heartbroken, so desperate (and so lovely), he can't bring himself to refuse her out of hand. He tells her he'll sleep on it. They agree to meet the next day to talk it over.Next day, they drive to the museum...he points out that there is a formidable presence of museum guards, and even more guards at the homes of the Minister of the Interior and the President, across the street. They go inside, and as he studies the security set-up, he notices a resemblance between Nicole and the Venus. ""Where were you in the middle of the 15th Century?"" he asks. ""I don't know,"" she retorts, ""but that's not how I was dressed,"" gesturing at the nude statue. He continues his reconnaissance. He notes that parcels are not permitted in the museum: they must be left at a desk in the lobby, but they are not searched...that there is a tapestry hanging on a frame in front of a fireplace...that there is a small utility closet at the bottom of the main staircase, the door of which is locked, but the key is kept on a hook at the back of the staircase. Exploring, he finds the guards' room, and goes inside. Posing as an official from the Ministry of Tourism, and asking indignant questions under the pretense that his sleeve became smeared with dust in the museum, he learns that the cleaning people come in every night at midnight. On his way out, he deliberately chooses the wrong door, and sees that it leads to the basement, and a possible alternate exit.They go for a walk in a nearby park. He sees a child's toy being demonstrated, a balsa-wood boomerang that soars in a circle, then returns to the thrower. He buys two. They stop at a second-hand shop, for a scrubwoman's outfit, and a plastic mop bucket. When they go back to his room at the Ritz, he tells Nicole to change into the clothes. Tired of following him on endless and seemingly unrelated errands, irritated at having no explanation as to what he is thinking, Nicole asks him suspiciously if they're planning the same sort of crime. Nevertheless, she puts on the clothes, and he starts to tell her what will happen at midnight in the museum. ""You DO have a plan, don't you!"" she exclaims, excited. ""Yes,"" he replies evenly. ""My plan is that I will be lying here in my bed with a good book, unless you tell me what this is all about."" She's surprised and crestfallen...but she can't explain, so he tells her she must go. Tears fill her eyes, and he angrily tells her they won't change his mind. He orders her back into the bathroom to change out of the clothes, and leave. As she turns dejectedly to do so, against his better judgment, he tells her to meet him at the museum just before closing the following day. Overjoyed, she agrees, and almost skips into the bathroom. Simon hits himself in the head with the plastic mop bucket.Next evening, just as Nicole is preparing to leave for the museum, Davis Leland turns up at her house with an enormous diamond ring, and in a very efficient and business-like manner, asks her to marry him. Afraid that refusing him will mean argument and delay, she takes the ring and dashes away, arriving at the museum only a few minutes late. Simon is impatient and irritated...she explains to him that she was getting engaged, and he retorts that they still have a little time if she'd like to go back and marry the man.They check the parcel of clothes at the desk, and go on into the museum. He checks on the closet, and quickly unlocks the door. Then he takes a handful of coins, and puts them in a brochure, and places the brochure precariously on the edge of a statue's pedestal. ""Watch for normal human reactions,"" he says to Nicole, and they move over by the fireplace. A guard picks up the brochure, and the coins scatter...several people bend down to pick them up, while many others watch. Simon and Nicole use the distraction to duck into the fireplace behind the tapestry. The museum closes and as the guards escort the other patrons out, they slip down the stairs and into the tiny closet. The guards return and make a round of all the floors. One of the guards finds the closet unlocked, gives it a cursory inspection (slim Nicole and slim Simon have both squeezed into a tiny shelf area), then locks the door and returns the key to the outside panel. Nicole panics, but Simon is unconcerned. They wait for an hour in the tiny closet. Then they hear the guards come out of their room, and tramp all over the museum again as they make their rounds. Simon is pleased: now he knows the schedule.Using a powerful magnet against the wall at the back of the closet, he is able to remove the key from its hook, ""walk"" it around the outside of the closet, and bring it inside under the door. With a specially-fitted tube, a hook, and another small magnet, he's able to draw the key up into the keyhole, and open the door. He runs to the front desk, grabs the clothes and runs back to the closet. He helps Nicole to put the clothes on over her own clothes, then he takes out and assembles one of the little boomerangs he'd bought the day before. Exasperated at the close quarters (""I hadn't counted on there being so much togetherness,"" she grumbles) and all the elaborate preparations, Nicole asks when they're finally going to steal the Venus. He tells her that one of the nice things about complicated mechanical systems is that they malfunction, and when that happens, you can always rely on normal human reactions. He asks her how she would feel if she was one of these guards, assigned to look out for a bunch of stuff she couldn't afford, and wasn't interested in, night after night. ""Irritated,"" she replies, wearily. ""Exactly,"" he says, and steps out of the closet onto the stairway.His first throw goes wide...but his second breaks the beam on the electric field surrounding the Venus, and a deafening alarm goes off. He grabs the returning boomerang and Nicole, and they both run back to the closet. The guards pour out of their room, and swarm all over the museum, and when the police arrive, they search as well. It's eventually determined that the alarm was false. The Minister of the Interior calls to complain about the noise from across the street. The head guard (Jacques Marin), a short, serious man, looks disgusted. ""A burglar alarm especially designed to give me heartburn,"" he mutters, as he resets it.Nicole realizes, for the first time, what a difficult and dangerous task they've undertaken. She tells Simon she wouldn't blame him if he left. ""Then what happens tomorrow when they test your million dollar baby?"" he asks quietly. She stares at him. ""It's a fake, isn't it,"" he says. She nods slowly, and asks how long he's known, and he answers: ""Since you first asked me to steal it."" She asks why he'd help if he knew...he leans in and kisses her gently, and she whispers, ""That's why,"" in wonder. ""Oh, I'm so stupid,"" she says, putting her arms around his neck. ""Please...explain it to me again!""After more ""explanation"", he goes out to set off the alarm a second time. Again, the lights go on, the guards gallop all over the museum, and the police arrive to assist...again, they find nothing. This time, it is ""His Excellency"" himself who calls up from across the street to complain. The head guard is properly intimidated. He doesn't reset the alarm...he turns it off.Simon is stunned to find that his plan has worked. Nevertheless, he pulls himself together, and attends to business. He goes up the stairs and takes the Venus, and conceals it in the bucket. He tells Nicole to hide in the fireplace again, and when the scrubwomen arrive, to come out on her hands and knees, scrubbing madly, and no matter whatever else happens to work her way back to the guard's room. ""The guards' room?"" she asks. ""When they discover the Venus is gone, there will be guards everywhere but in the guards' room,"" he says, and tells her to hang onto her bucket.At midnight, the scrubwomen arrive, and set to work. The guards also come out, and start rounds. It is several minutes before a guard (Mustache) notices that the Venus is gone. He points it out to the head guard, who is shocked insensible for a long moment. Then he hoarsely cries, ""Alarm!"" --and all hell breaks loose, with guards running every which way, bumping into each other, and stumbling over scrubwomen. It is a few moments more before the head guard realizes that the alarm is not sounding...because it has been turned off. He quickly turns it on again, but it is still silent. Mustache finally reaches through the beam, and the alarm goes off, adding to the bedlam.Nicole has worked her way to the guard room, and goes inside. One of the guards is there, sitting in a chair, reading a newspaper. She turns to flee, but he grabs her and kisses her...it's Simon. They leave quietly down the basement stairs.Reporters gather at Bonnet's house next morning, to take pictures of the empty niche, and ask him how he feels about the loss of his precious statue. He plays his feigned grief to the hilt. Upstairs, Nicole is chatting excitedly with Simon about the caper on the phone, and they arrange to meet later at the Ritz bar. The reporters leave, and Nichol runs downstairs, and she and her father hug joyously in their relief. He offers to take her out to celebrate, but she tells him she has an appointment later, at the Ritz. She runs back upstairs, and he repeats, ""The Ritz,"" looking thoughtful.Davis Leland has come to Monsieur Desolnay's office, in a state of extreme excitement. He wants to try and find the Venus, and purchase it...at any price...no questions asked. Desolnay implores him not to pursue it, but finally gives him the name of someone he thinks may be able to help: Simon Dermott, currently staying at the Ritz.They meet at the bar in the Ritz, and Simon tells Davis that he already has a few feelers out...just idle curiosity...and he believes he knows who might be responsible. He warns Davis he'll be buying something that he will never be able to show, or even to acknowledge that he owns. Davis is undeterred. Simon asks if Davis is acquainted with any member of the Bonnet familly, and Davis admits he's engaged to Bonnet's daughter. Simon tells him that if he wants the Venus, he'll have to give her up...that if he doesn't, the people who have the Venus will suspect a trap and he'll never be able to acquire it. Reluctantly, Davis agrees. Simon says he'll be in touch, and Davis starts to leave the bar...just as Nicole arrives. As Simon watches, amused, Davis almost breaks a leg avoiding her, when she's only trying to return his ring.She sits down next to Simon, and begins to chatter about how thrilling the theft had been, for her first effort. ""It was my first, too,"" he remarks. This admission stops her in mid-sentence. She asks, puzzled, ""Then you're not a burglar?"" He shakes his head. ""Who are you?"" she asks, filled with sudden foreboding. ""I'm a private consultant who specializes in museum security,"" he says, deliberately. ""I have advanced degrees in art history, chemistry and criminology. I also specialize in tracing and recovering stolen works of art, and in detecting and exposing forgeries."" She is so startled and dismayed she almost falls out of the booth. But he catches her, and at that moment Bonnet himself arrives, having correctly deduced the nature of Nicole's appointment. After Nicole introduces them, he asks what Simon intends to do. Simon replies that Bonnet has two gorgeous girls in his family...and he intends to keep the real one. But he has plans for the other girl as well, and he must leave now to make arrangements. After his departure, Nicole lets out a shocked little scream: Davis Leland's huge diamond ring is gone, too!Simon meets Davis at the airport, preparing to take off in his private jet. He hands Davis a crate, and tells him that he'll be contacted later for payment: the code word will be ""togetherness"". Davis takes the crate into the jet, and hurries directly to the restroom, where he can be alone. There, he opens the crate, removes the packing and reveals the Venus, in all its illicit splendor. Then, to his wonder, he notices that the diamond ring he gave to Nicole is tied with a bit of ribbon around the Venus's neck.Bonnet is delighted...Davis is the only collector who will never dare to have the statue tested. He asks, rather tentatively, about the money Simon got for the piece...Simon says he asked a nice round figure, and traces a large zero in the air with his index finger. ""You, sir, are a forger,"" he says. ""It's my job to catch forgers. One of us has to retire."" ""Fair enough,"" says Bonnet, ""Shall we flip a coin?"" ""I already did,"" replies Simon, ""You lost."" Bonnet struggles with himself for a moment, then extends his hand to seal the bargain.Nicole and Simon are leaving France...they'll lie low for a while in England, and get married there. As they drive through Bonnet's front gate, another car passes them on the way in...a Senor Paravideo (Marcel Dalio) who has long been trying to get hold of one of Bonnet's paintings. Simon stops the little yellow Jag, and he and Nicole turn to watch. Bonnet greets Paravideo with delight, and shows him inside. ""Who's that?"" asks Simon, pointedly. Nicole's hesitation is very brief: ""Papa's cousin,"" she replies, innocently, ""from South America."" He looks at her for a long time, then remarks, ""For someone who only started lying recently, you're showing a real flair for it."" ""Oh, thank you!"" she says, smiling radiantly. And they're off. And they all live happily ever after!

                    The story takes place in 16th century England. But men like Sir Thomas More, who love life yet have the moral fiber to lay down their lives for their principles, are found in every century. Concentrating on the last seven years of English chancellor's life, the struggle between More and his King, Henry VIII, hinges on Henry's determination to break with Rome so he can divorce his current wife and wed again, and good Catholic More's inability to go along with such heresy. More resigns as chancellor, hoping to be able to live out his life as a private citizen. But Henry will settle for nothing less than that the much respected More give public approval to his headstrong course.

                    King Henry VIII's desire for a son and heir leads him to seek a divorce from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne Boleyn. He had already received a dispensation from the Pope to marry Catherine - she was his brother's widow - and he seeks the support of Sir Thomas More who is soon named Chancellor. More is a devout Catholic and while he does not agree with the King's desire to divorce, he is completely silent in his opposition. His principles are tested however when he also remains silent after the King is named the head of the Church of England and subsequently when Parliament requires all to take an oath of allegiance. His silence is not sufficient for the King who wishes to have More's public endorsement. He is eventually brought to trial on charges of having accepted a bribe but it is one of his former supporters, Sir Richard Rich, who perjures himself leading to More being found guilty and beheaded.

                    The life of Sir Thomas More during the period of his service in various capacities to volatile King Henry VIII is presented. More, a lawyer and devoted member of the Church of England, and the King are often at odds with each other, the King nonetheless wanting More's blessing on matters as a moral and principled person. The biggest bone of contention is the King wanting More to wield his influence with the church to permit him to divorce Catherine of Aragon - who is unable to bore him children, meaning no male heir to the throne - so that he can marry Anne Boleyn. More is unwilling to do so, seeing it an act against his faith to the church. With the help of an ambitious, opportunistic and somewhat feckless young man named Richard Rich who More considers a friend, Thomas Cromwell, one of More's primary adversaries, plans to exploit the rift between the King and More to his own benefit for greater power within the court. The ultimate questions become how far the King will go to get what he wants, and how much More is willing to risk to remain true to his principles.

                    For Alfie, the only real life is sex life; only then can he kid himself he is living. Sex is not used as the working-class boy's way to 'the top'. Executive status has no appeal for Alfie. Nor has class mobility. He is quite content to stay where he is, as long as the 'birds' are in 'beautiful condition', as he assures us they are in one of the candid, over-the-shoulder asides to the camera which the film carries over from ""Tom Jones"". The film shows how much of the 'swinging 60's' quality of London life was a male creation, and through the dominance of the fashion photographers, a male prerogative.

San Pablo (whose crew is nicknamed the ""Sand Pebbles""), a gunboat serving on the Yangtze River Patrol in China, engineer Holman finds that Chinese coolies are actually doing most of the work on the ship. When he insists on working on the ship's engines himself, he earns the enmity of the Chinese ""boss"" of the engine room. Captain Collins (Richard Crenna) dismisses Holman's warnings that the machinery needs significant maintenance, and when the ship experiences inevitable engine troubles, the engine room boss is crushed to death by a giant piston when Holman lets him attempt the repair. The head coolie boss bitterly blames Holman for the accident.Told to train a replacement for the dead man, Holman chooses Po-Han (Mako), whom he also befriends, overcoming his bigoted assumptions about the intellectual abilities of the Chinese. Holman sticks up for Po-Han against a bully, and sets him up to win in a prize fight against his tormentor, crewman Stawski (Simon Oakland). Shipmate Frenchy (Richard Attenborough) uses the money to pay for the freedom of a young Chinese woman, Maily (Emmanuelle Arsan), saving her from a life of prostitution. Po-Han is later captured and tortured by a Communist mob because he works for the Americans. The captain attempts to pay ransom money to trade for Po-Han, but is ignored by the mob. Unable to save his friend, Holman shoots Po-Han to end his suffering. This further enrages the Communists, and the captain rebukes Holman for disobeying orders. The Captain informs Holman that because of his meddling, two crew workers have died and he intends on having him transferred out of the San Pablo.Frenchy eventually marries Maily in a makeshift ceremony witnessed by Holman and his love interest, Shirley Eckert (Candice Bergen), an American teacher at the China Light Mission. The Chinese form a naval blockade around the San Pablo, but Shirley is able to return to the mission accompanied on a boat with a student leader. When increasing tensions with the Chinese force the Americans to spend all winter on board under siege, Frenchy slips overboard and swims to shore to visit Maily.

Holman kills a student leader with the axe near the end of the fighting between the sailors and junk blockaders. The captain decides to take a small group to rescue the missionaries and informs the Ensign to sail back to the coast if the rescue party cannot return in time.

San Pablo - nicknamed the Sand Pebble - this being the latest in a very long string of assignments due to a unyielding view of his work leading to conflicts with many of his colleagues and ship captains. Life on the Sand Pebble is no different. The Sand Pebble is patrolling the interior waters of China, where the the U.S. government is trying to protect its interests in the face of Nationalist and Communist battles against the feudal warlords. On board the Sand Pebble, Holman must deal with a captain whose wants often do not match what Holman can carry out. Ultimately the Sand Pebble is placed under quiet siege by the Chinese who are using this action as a symbol of the unwanted U.S. presence. Holman is implicated in an incident which could cause the start of an ""all out"" war, and as such places him in a bad position with his shipmates. Amidst all this turmoil, two romances occur, the first between Holman's colleague, good-hearted Frenchy Burgoyne and a slave girl named Maily, and the second between Holman and missionary schoolteacher, Shirley Eckert. Both romances face major obstacles.

The lyrics tell the audience they will see some familiar things, others peculiar, some appealing, others appalling, some gaudy, and definitely others that are bawdy, in other words, something for everyone. Ultimately, Pseudolus promises a happy ending. The action, Pseudolus tells the audience, takes place in Rome around three adjacent houses: the house of Erronius (Latin for ""wrong""), an old man who has been searching for his children who were stolen by pirates while they were infants; the house of Marcus Lycus, a buyer and seller of beautiful women, and the house of Senex (Latin for ""old man"" or ""senile""), a Roman senator, his wife, Domina (Latin for ""mistress""), who is loathed by her husband, their son, Hero, and his slave, Pseudolus, who is attempting to raise enough money to buy his freedom.One day when Senex and Domina leave for a trip, Hero tells Pseudolus that he's in love with a girl in the house next door. Pseudolus seizes the opportunity to bargin for his freedom. Hero agrees if Pseudolus can get the girl for him, he will free him.Pseudolus and Hero visit the house of Lycus to purchase Hero's beloved. Lycus presents several of his courtesans for their inspection: Tintinabula (Latin for ""bell""), a bell-wearing beauty, dances to middle eastern music; Vibrata (Latin for ""vibrant""), an energetic, lively dark-skinned lovely who is dressed in a leopard skin bikini, dances to jazz; Geminae (Latin for ""twins"") are a matched pair that Lycus will not separate; Panacea (Latin for ""cure all"") dances seductively; and Gymnasia (Latin for ""nude,"" which she may have been in the original musical, but in the film she is portrayed as speechless) is a mute from the Island of Silent Women. Gymnasia and Pseudolus communicate in sign language and he immediately falls for her. When Hero's dream woman is not among the girls who are presented, Lycus tells them that she is a virgin who recently arrived from Crete and he has sold her to a famous Roman soldier. Being an excellent fabricator of lies, Pseudolus claims Crete has been ravaged by a plague, and since he has already had the plague, he would happily look after the girl in Senex's house until the soldier comes to claim her. Lycus gulibly agrees to Pseudolus offer.Once they return to the house of Senex, Hero and the girl get to know each other. He learns that her name is Philia (which in Greek means ""love""). Philia sings ""Lovely"" (as ""I'm Lovely""), in which she explains that ""lovely is the one thing I can do."" Hero then sings his reply, ""You're Lovely,"" and they both agree they are happy to have found each other. Even though Philia has fallen in love with Hero, she insists she must honor the contract Marcus Lycus made to sell her.Pseudolus devises a plan to give Philia a sleeping potion. Once she is unconscious, he will tell Lycus that she died from the plague. When they move her body for burial, Hero can then take her away to Greece and Pseudolus will get his freedom. Pseudolus steals a potion book from Hysterium (Latin for ""hysterial""), another slave in the house of Senex. The only sleeping potion ingredient he doesn't have is mare's sweat, so he and Hero head in different directions to obtain some.While they are away, Senex unexpectedly returns home and knocks three times on his door. Pseudolus had told Philia that three knocks was the signal of her purchaser, Captain Miles Gloriosus (Latin for ""braggart soldier""). Hearing the knocks, Philia assumes Senex is the captain, so she offers herself to him. She tells him that he may have her body but will never have her heart. The old Senator is more than happy to take her body, with or without her heart.Pseudolus returns with the mare's sweat just in time to see Senex and Philia embracing. He tells Senex that the girl is a new maid he has hired. That leads into the hilarious song, ""Everybody Ought to Have a Maid."" Senex is very much in favor of maids especially those who butter up the master with sexual favors. Hysterium joins Senex and Pseudolus for a chorus of the song, and then they are joined by Lycus, who is checking on the condition of the virgin. These lecherous fellows particularly like maids who wriggle, giggle and jiggle as they putter around the house.After the song, Pseudolus convinces Senex that he needs a bath after his road trip (Senex is actually smelling the mare's sweat) and since his son could be home, he should bathe and receive the girl in Erronius' long-abandoned house next door.Just after Senex heads for his bath, Erronius returns from his exhaustive twenty year search for his two long-lost offspring. The elderly and semi-senial Erronius, who is now almost blind, reveals that each of the children is wearing a ring with a gaggle of geese engraved upon it.When Erronius heads for his house, he hears Senex singing as he bathes. Hysterium, desperate to keep Erronius out of his house, tells the old man his house is haunted. Erronius demands Hysterium find a soothsayer to banish the haunting spirit from his house. Overhearing, Psuedolus pretends to be a soothsayer and orders Erronius to run around the Seven Hills of Rome seven times to banish the spirit.Meanwhile, two Roman Army emissaries of Captain Miles Gloriosus arrive at Lycus' house to make certain everything is in order for their commander to receive his purchased courtesan. They threaten to turn Lycus' women over to the soldiers and burn his house if anything is amiss.Fearing the Captain's wrath, Lycus talks Pseudolus into substituting for him for an hour. Pseudolus is more than happy to oblige since he gets to see Gymnasia again. Pseudolus convinces Lycus that it would be best to move all the girls into Senex's house. Meanwhile, Senex has finished his bath, but orders Hysterium to bring him an energy (love) potion prior to his rendezvous with Philia.When Captain Gloriosus and his troops march into the city, the captain sings ""Bring Me My Bride."" This conceited soldier claims to be a man among men but is also admired and desired by all women. He is impatient to receive his bride because he has towns to plunder, temples to burn and women to abuse.Pseudolus, pretending to be Lycus, tires to delay delivering Philia. The Captain gives him half an hour to deliver the girl or else. While Gloriosus waits, he dictates his memoirs and his men enjoy Lycus' courtesans.Meanwhile, Lycus, who is drinking in a nearby bar, learns from a fellow patron there is no plague in Crete. When he tries to return to reveal the lie, he isn't admitted into his own house because everyone, as he had instructed, swears Pseudolus is Lycus.Domina returns from her trip early because she had a premonition that Senex was up to something. She goes to the market to purchase a breeder slave and picks a robust, stocky female specimen. Once they return home, the breeder takes a liking to Pseudolus. He puts her in a room and tells her he will knock on the door three times when he returns. He sends one of the Captain's soldiers to the room and tells him to knock three times (the soldier thinks he's getting one of Lycus' women). Later, Pseudolus sends Senex to the breeder's room (Senex assumes Philia is there), but escapes the breeder slave through the window.When Domina is introduced to the Captain, she is smitten. Then when Hysterium brings the energy potion to Senex, Domina stops him and thirstly consumes the liquid. Pseudolus tells Domina to wait in the Green Room and he will send the Captain to her. About the same time, Senex climbs in the window of the Green Room, where he expects to be joined by Philia. He and his wife are both unpleasantly surprised to end up in the same room.When Philia hears the voice of the Captain, she recognizes it as the brute who raped her country, ""Thrace."" She claims he did it three times. Pseudolus questions, ""He raped Thrace thrice?""Pseudolus decides to tell the Captain the virgin has died, but in order to make it convincing, he needs a body. After a lot of convincing, Hysterium agrees to dress in drag and pretend to be the dead Philia. Pseudolus sings a reprise of ""Lovely"" (as ""You're Lovely""; a hilarious self-spoof of the musical number sung by Hero earlier in the film) to convince Hysterium he can pull off the ruse. Once convinced, Hysterium sings ""I'm Lovely."" To complete Hysterium's outfit, Pseudolus gives him the old man's ring - the one with the gaggle of geese.As the funeral procession begins, Hero returns with a cup of mare's sweat. He is so distraught when he learns that Philia is dead that he plans to throw himself to the lions. Before he leaves, however, Senex mistakes the mare's sweat for the energy potion, drinks it and immediately passes out.Pseudolus tells the Captain the virgin died because the sight of his glorious physique was too much of a shock. The conceited Gloriosus competely understands and is saddened that the girl would have died before she experienced him. Gloriosus insists on a proper funeral including cremation of the body. He also composes and sings a funeral dirge (""The Dirge""). When the Captain starts to give the dead virgin a farewell kiss, Pseudolus tells him she actually died of the plague she contracted in Crete. Unfortunately, the Captain had been stationed in Crete and knew there was no plague there. When the Captain says he is going to cut the girl's heart out and take it with him, Hysterium jumps up and runs away. Gymnasia communicates to Philia that Hero thinks she is dead, so he is going to throw himself to the lions. Distraught, Philia decides to sacrifice herself to the gods. Gymnasia then tells Pseudolus that Philia and Hero are both planning to kill themselves.Hero sneaks into a nearby arena during a gladiator training session. Pseudolus finds him there just before the gladitor knocks Hero in the head. He manages to save Hero and tells him that Philia is alive and has gone to the Temple of the Virgins to sacrifice herself. The gladitor then fights Pseudolus and captures him, but Gymnasia saves Pseudolus and they get away in a chariot. Hero climbs to the roof of the Temple and from a hole in the top saves Philia. They ride away in a chariot. A madcap, comic chase ensues with the Captain chasing Hero and Philia and Pseudolus and Gymnasia. Once the Captain captures them, they return to Rome for a quick wedding and a slow execution. Back in the city, Erronius, who has made several circles around the hills of the city, recognizes the gaggle-of-geese ring worn by Philia. Miles also has a gaggle-of-geese ring, which means they are brother and sister - the long-lost siblings of Erronius. That means Philia is a free-born citizen of Rome and cannot be sold as a courtesan. It also means that the Captain cannot marry his sister, so Hero and Philia can marry.A happy ending just as the lyrics of ""Comedy Tonight"" had promised (a reprise of the song is heard). Hero and Philia get each other, Senex and Domina get each other (whether they like it or not), Miles gets the twins, Erronius gets his family back, the soldiers get Lycus' women, Lycus must get a new supply of girls, and Pseudolus gets his freedom. And the moral? The cast sings, ""Morals tomorrow! Comedy tonight!""","
    
                    Pseudolus is the laziest slave in Rome and has but one wish, to purchase his freedom.

The two of them are quite in a predicament because even though Dickie's wound from a grazing bullet is superficial, Albie still needs immediate attention as he is hit in the belly, massively bleeding. Safe, yet lost, with a useless car in his hands and the taste of failure in his mouth, Dickie leaves Albie alone in a straight stretch of road in the prospect of finding help, while promising a quick return. With this intention, Dickie's walk will eventually lead him to a seemingly deserted, magnificent castle by the sea; the perfect hideout for the two gangsters to spend the night and regain strength in safety. Little does he know, that this 11th Century château is none other than the place where Walter Scott wrote his famous novel ""Rob Roy"", now the home of George, a retired, feeble factory owner and Teresa, his young, frivolous French wife. Home invaded and forced to go along with and obey Dickie's orders, the couple will bring half-dead Albie back home while waiting for the morning to come and with it, help from Katelbach, the crime lord. Instead, the unexpected visit from the obnoxious Fairweathers and their friends to bring the newlywed couple a present will be indeed the last straw. Now penniless, manipulated and on the verge of an emotional breakdown, coward George must for once find the courage to defend his fortress and his remaining dignity.

"31","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060794/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Romania, the 19th Century. Dr. Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) arrives in a secluded Transylvanian village where he checks into a local inn and meets with Inspector Kruger (Piero Lulli) the local constable who is investigating the death of a young girl employed as a maid at Villa Graps. The inspector has summoned Dr. Eswai to the village to perform an autopsy on the girl, much to the dismay of the locals. With the assistance of Monica (Erika Blanc), a nurse who just recently returned to the village for the first time since she was a child, Dr. Eswai carries out the autopsy. They make an incredible discovery: a gold coin imbedded in the dead girls heart. Monica reveals that this is consistent with a local superstion. Only with money in the heart, can one who meets a violent death ever rest in peace, says Monica. Following the autopsy, Eswai assists Monica back to her home. He is then attacked by a small mob of several villagers who swear vengeance on him for profaning the dead girls body. Only the sudden appearance of a mysterious woman, clad in black, saves the doctor from being beaten to death. But before he can thank her, she disappears into the fog.Back at the inn, Eswai receives a note instructing him to join Inspector Kruger at Villa Graps. When the doctor asks Nadine (Micaela Esdra), the innkeepers little girl, to direct him to the villa, she tells him to stay away from it. But Eswai leaves for the villa anyway, and when Nadine goes to lock the front door behind him, she is terrified by the sight of a ghostly little girl, peering in at her through the window. Nadine tells her parents what she saw, and they send out for Ruth (Fabienne Dali), a local sorceress who has the ability to ward off evil spirits. When she arrives, Ruth is the same black-clad woman who had earlier rescued Dr. Eswai from the villagers. Ruth says several prayers over the girl before giving her a leech-vine to wear around her waist. Ruth says that as long as she wears this, Nadine will be safe.At the villa, Eswai is confronted by Baroness Graps (Giana Vivaldi). Shut away from the outside world in a morbid environment dominated by black lace curtains and remnant of the past, the Baroness appears haunted by supernatural apparitions.

    Synopsis
    Romania, the 19th Century. Dr. Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) arrives in a secluded Transylvanian village where he checks into a local inn and meets with Inspector Kruger (Piero Lulli) the local constable who is investigating the death of a young girl employed as a maid at Villa Graps. The inspector has summoned Dr. Eswai to the village to perform an autopsy on the girl, much to the dismay of the locals. With the assistance of Monica (Erika Blanc), a nurse who just recently returned to the village for the first time since she was a child, Dr. Eswai carries out the autopsy. They make an incredible discovery: a gold coin imbedded in the dead girls heart. Monica reveals that this is consistent with a local superstion. Only with money in the heart, can one who meets a violent death ever rest in peace, says Monica. Following the autopsy, Eswai assists Monica back to her home. He is then attacked by a small mob of several villagers who swear vengeance on him for profaning the dead girls body. Only the sudden appearance of a mysterious woman, clad in black, saves the doctor from being beaten to death. But before he can thank her, she disappears into the fog.Back at the inn, Eswai receives a note instructing him to join Inspector Kruger at Villa Graps. When the doctor asks Nadine (Micaela Esdra), the innkeepers little girl, to direct him to the villa, she tells him to stay away from it. But Eswai leaves for the villa anyway, and when Nadine goes to lock the front door behind him, she is terrified by the sight of a ghostly little girl, peering in at her through the window. Nadine tells her parents what she saw, and they send out for Ruth (Fabienne Dali), a local sorceress who has the ability to ward off evil spirits. When she arrives, Ruth is the same black-clad woman who had earlier rescued Dr. Eswai from the villagers. Ruth says several prayers over the girl before giving her a leech-vine to wear around her waist. Ruth says that as long as she wears this, Nadine will be safe.
At the villa, Eswai is confronted by Baroness Graps (Giana Vivaldi). Shut away from the outside world in a morbid environment dominated by black lace curtains and remnant of the past, the Baroness appears haunted by supernatural apparitions. She curtly tells Eswai that she never receives guests, denies any knowledge of Inspector Krugers whereabouts, and eventually slam the parlor door in his face. The doctor then sees a ghostly, white-clad girl, who identifies herself as Melissa (Valerio Valeri).

Armstrong tells Sherman that he did not want her to come along, and en route to Copenhagen, he receives a radiogram to pick up a book once in Copenhagen. The book, allegedly a first-edition of one of Armstrong's book, actually contains a message that says, ""Contact in case (of emergency.)"" He tells Sherman he is going to Stockholm, but she discovers he is flying to East Berlin, and she follows him there. When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the East German government, and Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected to the other side. Sherman, however, is extremely uncomfortable with this move, realizing if the apparent defection is in fact real, given the circumstances of the Cold War of the period, she would likely never see her home or family again. They are constantly accompanied by Professor Karl Manfred (Günter Strack), who took part in arranging Armstrong's defection to the East.Armstrong visits a contact, a 'farmer' (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment in order to learn just how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems. While Armstrong does not inform the U.S. government of his plan, he has made preparations to return to the West via an escape network, known as (Pi).However, Armstrong is followed to this farm by his official body man, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), an East German security officer assigned to him. Gromek realizes what is and that Armstrong is a double agent, and as Gromek is calling the police to report his suspicions, a tortuous and violent fight scene commences that ends with Gromek being killed. So as to not arouse the suspicion of the taxi driver who brought Armstrong to the farm, a gun is not used to kill Gromek, but instead he is choked, stabbed, hit with a shovel, and, ultimately, gassed to death by Armstrong and the farmer's wife (Carolyn Conwell). Gromek and his motorcycle are then buried by the 'farmer' and his wife. The taxicab driver (Peter Lorre Jr.) who drove Armstrong to the farm, however, reports on Armstrong's behavior to the police when he later sees Gromek's missing person ad in the newspaper. The remains of Gromek are found; the fate of the farmer's wife is not shown.Meanwhile, Armstrong visits the physics faculty of Karl Marx University in Leipzig, where his interview with the scientists is abruptly ended when he is questioned by security officials about the missing Gromek. At the same time, the faculty try to interrogate Sherman about her knowledge of the American ""Gamma Five"" anti-missile program, but she refuses to cooperate and runs from the room even though she had agreed to cooperate and defect to East Germany. At this point, Armstrong secretly confides to her his actual motives, and asks her to go along with the ruse. He finally goads Professor Lindt into revealing his anti-missile equations in a fit of pique over what Lindt believes are Armstrong's mathematical mistakes. When Lindt hears over the university's loudspeaker system that Armstrong and Sherman are being sought for questioning when Gromek's body is found, he realizes that he has given up his secrets while learning nothing in return. Armstrong and Sherman escape from the school with a little help from of the university clinic physician Dr. Koska (Gisela Fischer).They travel to East Berlin, pursued by the Stasi, in a decoy bus operated by the escape network, led by Mr. Jacobi (David Opatoshu). Roadblocks, highway robbery by Soviet Army deserters, and bunching with the ""real"" bus result in the police becoming aware of the decoy bus and everyone flees off the bus and scatter in the streets.While looking for the Friedrichstraße post office, the two encounter the exiled Polish countess Kuchinska (Lila Kedrova) who leads them to the post office in hopes of being sponsored for an American visa.

Her father had just abandoned the family, leaving her mother, Hazel Starr, to open the boarding house to survive. Hazel used her attractive older daughter, Alva Starr, as bait to lure men to the house as boarders, Alva who Willie idolized. Alva, in turn, fostered this role in the hopes of finding a wealthy man who would take her away from Dodson - preferably to New Orleans which she dreamed of seeing one day - hopefully a man she would love in return, not just for his money. Hazel tried to push Alva on to their wealthiest boarder, married Gerard Johnson, who was old enough to be Alva's father. Hazel's boyfriend, J.J. Nichols, also one of the boarders, came because of Alva and stayed because of Alva. A young mysterious stranger came to stay at the house for a week, his name being Owen Legate. It wasn't until near the end of Owen's stay that the Starrs and the rest of the town learned he was a New Orleans based railroad executive in town to review the personnel records to see which men would be laid off due largely to the downturn in the economy, which would probably negatively affect the Starrs' livelihood. Regardless, Alva fell for Owen, also despite or perhaps because he saw through her whorish facade for the scared young woman she really was, she who used fantasy to endure her reality. Willie concludes the story with if there was a happily ever after ending for Alva and Owen, which if did happen would have been with Hazel fighting all the way, as that would have meant that Hazel would have lost her meal ticket.

He is disengaged at his job as a banker, while the love with his wife has dwindled. Through a friend who he thought had died years earlier, Hamilton is approached by a secret organization, known simply as the ""Company,"" which offers wealthy people a second chance at life. The Company, in the person of Mr. Ruby (Jeff Corey), interviews Hamilton, then shows him a film of him attacking a girl after he'd unknowingly consumed drugged food & drink offered him by the Company. They threaten to blackmail Hamilton forcing him to sign on, foreshadowing the unfortunate consequences of accepting the Company's assistance.Hamilton's death is staged to make it look as if he perished in a hotel fire with a corpse left disguised as him. Through extensive plastic surgery and psychoanalysis, Hamilton is transformed into Tony Wilson (Rock Hudson). He is provided with a new home, a new identity (as Wilson), new friends and a devoted manservant. The details of his new existence suggest that there was once a real Tony Wilson, but what became of him is a mystery.Wilson copes with his new world. Relocated to a fancy home in Malibu, California, where he is an already established artist, he commences a relationship with a young woman named Nora Marcus (Salome Jens) and for a time he is happy but soon becomes troubled by the emotional confusion of his new identity, as well as by the exuberance of renewing his youth.At a dinner party he hosts for neighbors, Wilson drinks himself into a stupor and begins to babble about his former life as Hamilton. It turns out that his neighbors are ""reborns"" like himself, sent to keep an eye on his adjustment. Nora is actually an agent of the Company and her attentions to Wilson are designed merely to ensure his cooperation.In violation of Company policy, Wilson, posing as an old friend of her husband's, visits his former wife (Frances Reid) in his new persona. He learns that his marriage had failed because he was distracted by the pursuit of career and material possessions, the very things in life that others made him believe were important.Wilson returns to the Company and announces a desire to start again with yet another identity. The Company offers to accommodate him, but asks if he would first provide the names of some past acquaintances who might like to be ""reborn."" He refuses since he now knows of the drawbacks to being ""reborn"" and also doesn't want to delay the Company's procedure for a new identity for himself.While awaiting his reassignment, Wilson encounters Charlie Evans (Murray Hamilton), the friend who had originally recruited him into the Company. Evans was also ""reborn"" and likewise could not make a go of his new life. Together, they speculate on the reason for their failure to adjust, attributing it to the fact that they allowed others, including the Company, to make life choices for them.This realization comes too late. Wilson/Hamilton is suddenly strapped to a gurney and as he is wheeled down the hallway, a priest reads him his last rites. He is eventually wheeled into a small room where he learns that failed reborns are not actually provided with new identities but instead become the cadavers used to fake new clients' deaths.","
    
                    Middle-aged banker Arthur Hamilton is given the opportunity to start a completely new life when he receives calls from his old friend Charlie. The only problem is that Charlie is supposed to be dead. Hamilton is eventually introduced to a firm that will fake his death and create an entirely new look and life for him. After undergoing physical reconstruction surgery and months of training and psychotherapy, Hamilton returns to the world in the form of artist Tony Wilson. He has a nice house in Malibu and a manservant, a company employee who is there to assist him with his adjustment.

                    Arthur Hamilton is a middle aged New York banker living in Scarsdale. He's married with a grown daughter he rarely sees anymore. He is generally disengaged from everything in his life. Based on a series of telephone calls he receives from his supposedly deceased friend Charlie Evans, Arthur is drawn into a company that provides him with a second chance in life. Initially resisting this opportunity, 'they' convince him that he has little to live for in his current life, which includes a past indiscretion, albeit one unintentional on his part. His 'rebirth' will include a cadaver to replace his current body after his death, enough money for his current family to live comfortably after his departure, enough money for his new start in life, a surgical make-over of his current self, and a new identity based on his subconscious desires. This new identity is as a Malibu based painter christened Antiochus 'Tony' Wilson. To assist him in this transition to Tony Wilson, the company provides him with a counselor of sorts, acting as a live-in housekeeper named John, who attends to whatever Tony requires emotionally to make the transition successfully. Even with John's help, Tony is finding it difficult to make the transition, despite or perhaps in spite of meeting a woman named Nora Marcus, with whom he falls in love. He has to discover where he went wrong in his life as Arthur Hamilton and where he went wrong in his transition to Tony Wilson before he can find out where he wants to go and how to achieve getting there. But will the company help him achieve what he wants?

    Synopsis
    Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph) is a middle-aged man whose life has lost purpose. He is disengaged at his job as a banker, while the love with his wife has dwindled. Through a friend who he thought had died years earlier, Hamilton is approached by a secret organization, known simply as the ""Company,"" which offers wealthy people a second chance at life. The Company, in the person of Mr. Ruby (Jeff Corey), interviews Hamilton, then shows him a film of him attacking a girl after he'd unknowingly consumed drugged food & drink offered him by the Company. They threaten to blackmail Hamilton forcing him to sign on, foreshadowing the unfortunate consequences of accepting the Company's assistance.Hamilton's death is staged to make it look as if he perished in a hotel fire with a corpse left disguised as him. Through extensive plastic surgery and psychoanalysis, Hamilton is transformed into Tony Wilson (Rock Hudson). He is provided with a new home, a new identity (as Wilson), new friends and a devoted manservant. The details of his new existence suggest that there was once a real Tony Wilson, but what became of him is a mystery.Wilson copes with his new world. Relocated to a fancy home in Malibu, California, where he is an already established artist, he commences a relationship with a young woman named Nora Marcus (Salome Jens) and for a time he is happy but soon becomes troubled by the emotional confusion of his new identity, as well as by the exuberance of renewing his youth.At a dinner party he hosts for neighbors, Wilson drinks himself into a stupor and begins to babble about his former life as Hamilton. It turns out that his neighbors are ""reborns"" like himself, sent to keep an eye on his adjustment. Nora is actually an agent of the Company and her attentions to Wilson are designed merely to ensure his cooperation.In violation of Company policy, Wilson, posing as an old friend of her husband's, visits his former wife (Frances Reid) in his new persona. He learns that his marriage had failed because he was distracted by the pursuit of career and material possessions, the very things in life that others made him believe were important.Wilson returns to the Company and announces a desire to start again with yet another identity. The Company offers to accommodate him, but asks if he would first provide the names of some past acquaintances who might like to be ""reborn."" He refuses since he now knows of the drawbacks to being ""reborn"" and also doesn't want to delay the Company's procedure for a new identity for himself.While awaiting his reassignment, Wilson encounters Charlie Evans (Murray Hamilton), the friend who had originally recruited him into the Company. Evans was also ""reborn"" and likewise could not make a go of his new life. Together, they speculate on the reason for their failure to adjust, attributing it to the fact that they allowed others, including the Company, to make life choices for them.This realization comes too late. Wilson/Hamilton is suddenly strapped to a gurney and as he is wheeled down the hallway, a priest reads him his last rites. He is eventually wheeled into a small room where he learns that failed reborns are not actually provided with new identities but instead become the cadavers used to fake new clients' deaths.

                    A man and a woman meet by accident on a Sunday evening at their childrens' boarding school. Slowly they reveal themselves to each other, finding that each is a widow/widower. Each is slow to reveal anything personal so that each revelation is hidden by a misperception. They become friends, then close friends, and then she reveals that she can't have a lover because, for her, her husband's memory is still too strong. Much of the film is told wordlessly in action, or through hearing one of their thoughts as they go about their day.

A narrator tells us, ""The year 1990, the problem of traveling to the moon has been solved for many years. Space stations have been built there and authorized personnel come and go as they wish, but the moon is a dead world. And the great question about space still remains, does life exist on another planet? To seek an answer to this question, the major powers of the world have been actively preparing at the International Institute of Space Technology to explore the planets Venus and Mars."" Allan Brenner (John Saxon) enters the Astro Communications office to see Laura James (Judi Meredith) for a lunch date. She has been monitoring signals believed to be from another planet in our galaxy.On an alien world, we see their sun set over a beach. Their counterparts to ours on Earth are sending signals out into space. Their technology is equal to, or greater than our own. Allan and Laura finish their lunch outside as Paul Grant (Dennis Hopper) on the left and Tony Barrata (Don Eitner) on the right join them at their table. They barely start their lunch when an announcement is made calling all personnel to assemble for an important message from Dr. Farraday (Basil Rathbone). The four are joined on their walk to the assembly by Cmdr. Anders Brockman (Robert Boon). Farraday tells the assembled that they have deciphered the message send by another civilization in space. An ambassador will be dispatched to Earth from their planet. On the alien planet a ship is prepared and launched. It is a spherical shaped craft with a belt of two metal tubes near the bottom. The aliens are human-like in their appearance. An alien probe is sent to Earth prior to the main ship's arrival and lands in the ocean. The capsule is retrieved and sent to the IIST labs for study. A record of the alien ship's entire flight is included in the probe. Farraday and his assistant (Forrest J. Ackerman) enter the Communications office and confer with Laura. Laura plays the alien transmission of their flight, including the crash landing on Mars. Farraday believes there may be survivors on the alien ship. Farraday calls a press conference for the next morning.Farraday proposes a rescue mission using the spaceship, Oceano, and to push up the schedule six months. Supply ships are sent to the moon. Farraday and his staff have moved to the moon to supervise the rescue mission. Laura is unhappy that Allan Brenner will not be on the Oceano rescue ship with her. The rescue ship is launched and Allan watches it depart in his spacesuit from the surface of the moon. Brockman reports a successful launch to Farraday. Brockman reads a book, as Paul Grant and Laura James get their meal. Before they can eat the ship encounters a sunburst that damages some of the ship's instruments. Laura contacts Farraday and reports that they have entered the orbit of Mars using emergency instruments. They begin their search for the alien's ship. They find it and report same to Farraday. The Oceano lands on Mars not far from the alien ship. Brockman and Grant don their space suits and walk over to the alien ship. Brockman enters the disabled alien craft only to discover the crew dead. Back on Earth, a newspaper headline announces, ""Successful Landing on Mars; Alien Spaceship Discovered."" Another article is titled, ""Single Dead Astronaut Found on Spacecraft; Mystery Deepens."" On the Moon base, Brenner and Tony Barrata propose taking the smaller rocket, Meteor, to Mars and deploying the search satellites immediately. Farraday explains that the Meteor can only carry a small amount of fuel, not enough to land on Mars, let alone return to Earth. Brenner explains they will land on Phobos, and then take the rescue ship to the surface and return on the Oceano. Farraday agrees to consider the plan. He finally agrees and the Meteor arrives in orbit around Mars. The satellite is deployed and the Meteor lands on the tiny moon, Phobos. Brockman calculates that the Meteor must depart within thirty minutes or they will be stuck on the tiny moon for a week. As luck would have it, the Meteor landed close to the other alien ship, the rescue ship, the one thought to have landed somewhere else on Mars. Brenner and Barrata walk to the rescue ship. They find the sole occupant, a woman in a spacesuit and carry her back to the Meteor. The Alien Queen (Florence Marly) is placed in a seat while Brenner and Barrata decide who will remain behind, as the craft can only carry two. Brenner crash lands on Mars and carries the Queen back to the Ocean. Brockman and Grant go out to find Brenner and the Queen, now lost in a sandstorm. The storm passes and Grant enters the Oceano carrying the Queen. She is wearing a red spacesuit that is quite form fitting. We can see her skin is a greenish color, but otherwise she is quite human in appearance. Laura asks, ""Paul, who brought her?"" Before Grant can answer, the door opens and Allan Brenner walks in. Brockman explains there is not enough fuel to stop on Phobos to retrieve Tony Barrata. He conveys his concern to Farraday who assures Brockman that a rescue ship will be dispatched to rescue Barrata, but Tony will need to conserve his emergency rations.The Alien Queen begins to come to. The first person she sees is Paul Grant. She smiles at Paul, next at Cmdr. Brockman and finally at Allan. She registers her approval with a toothy grin. But when Laura steps up there is a marked change in her countenance. The crew takes note of this. Brockman assigns the task of seeing to the passenger to Paul Grant. ""I thought of suggesting it to Laura, but it seems our visitor doesn't get along very well with her own sex."" The Oceano departs Mars and the crew goes about their duties. Paul is showing the Alien Queen how to drink water from a bottle. We now get a good look at the so called ambassador. She is very human-like in her appearance, except for the greenish cast to her skin. Her hair is white, cut short, lacquered, and pulled to a point near the back of her head. She drinks the water, but refuses solid food. It is clear Paul is enjoying his duty. Brockman wants to study her blood. He thinks it may be high in chlorophyll. When Laura gives him a syringe, and the Queen sees the needle, she recoils in horror. She knocks it to the cabin floor, breaking it. Brockman observes, ""This is more than some childish fear of the needle. Perhaps she has an extremely low pain threshold. Perhaps...But we mustn't do anything that may affect her health adversely. She is probably the most valuable specimen for scientific research in the history of our planet. To get her back to Earth safely has to be our first consideration."" The sleep period buzzer sounds and Paul is assigned the first watch. Paul records his notes on tape. He hears a strange buzzing sound, like a hive of bees. He walks back to investigate. The Queen places her hand on his shoulder. When he turns to look at her, she is smiling, but her eyes have lit up. Paul is mesmerized and she approaches him.The next morning, Brockman enters the cabin and sees Paul. He thinks Paul is asleep. He tries to wake the crewman, but Paul slumps over in his chair. Brockman calls to Laura and Allan to help. Brockman pronounces Paul dead. Laura goes back to check on the passenger. An examination of Paul's wrist shows a wound and a lot of blood. Laura's scream brings her crew mates back to the passenger. The Queen is asleep; her mouth shows a trickled of blood on the corner. Brockman says, ""Now we know how she feeds at least."" ""She's a monster,"" Allan replies. Allan wants to destroy the passenger, but Brockman disagrees and explains he will feed her with blood plasma. Laura reports the findings to Farraday. Paul Grant's body is disposed of in space. Allan is troubled by the fact that there was no sign of a struggle. Brockman speculates that some anesthesia in her saliva allowed her to feed with no resistance by Paul. Brockman and Laura give her the first taste of blood plasma. Brockman records his notes on tape. He concludes that the plasma seems to satisfy her hunger for blood, but adds that they ran out of plasma and will need to provide blood donations from the remaining crew. He stops and notices the alien in her room and the strange buzzing sound from the same location. She approaches the commander. He pulls a gun and points it at her. He drops the gun and stares into her eyes.The next day, with Brockman dead, there is no one to countermand Allan's action to immobilize the alien vampire. He ties her to a chair and tells the unconscious creature, ""When you wake up this time you won't be able to move."" Allan is now convinced she must have hypnotized her prey before killing and consuming their blood. Farraday wants Brockman's body returned for autopsy. During the next sleep cycle, Laura sleeps while Allan remains awake and reads a book. The Queen awakes and using some power, burns the ropes securing her arms to the chair. She walks past a sleeping Laura and heads towards Allan. Laura awakes in a start and gets up. She notices the ropes and the empty chair, but only slowly walks to the control room. There she spots the alien crouched over Allan, feeding on his blood. The two scuffle and in the process, Laura scratches the alien's back. When the Queen notices her own green blood on her hand, she runs away shrieking. Allan is on the floor and regains consciousness as Laura treats the wound on his wrist. He asks, ""She got to me didn't she?"" Laura explains that they fought and she ran away. The pair go to check on their visitor. The alien is laying on a bed with one arm brushing the cabin floor. A puddle of green fluid is below her outstretched arm. Allan observes that she is dead and why she wouldn't allow the blood sample; she's a hemophiliac. She bled to death.The Oceano approaches and lands on Earth. When Laura opens a cabinet to retrieve goggles she discovers that it is filled with red pulsating eggs sitting in a green gel. All the pieces come together for Allan. He concludes, ""That's it. That's why they sent her. She wasn't just an ambassador, she was a Queen. A Queen Bee. Maybe this is how their society is set up. A Queen who does all the breeding. Or maybe their planet was dying and they just sent her to bring her kind to Earth. Laura, we have to destroy these."" Laura reminds Allan that it is up to the scientific community to study and control this remarkable find. Laura notices more eggs when she opens another cabinet. Farraday enters with his staff and they retrieve the eggs. We close with a close-up of the red, pulsating eggs on a tray, followed by the cast credits.","
    
                    The year is 1990. An alien species makes contact with Earth through radio transmission, notifying of an imminent visit. Alien ship crash lands on Mars, and a rescue team is sent out from Earth. (The plot thickens! :) Eventually a surviving female is located and brought on to the human ship. The female is light green with an amazing hair-do. After some unsuccessful attempts by the human crew to feed her, she is more or less left to herself. (Ominous, is it not?) While most of the crew sleeps, the Alien female hypnotizes the astronaut on guard. When the crew awakens, she is sleeping, and the guard is DEAD! Brief examination shows that the Alien ate his blood. THE QUEEN OF BLOOD! Naturally, there is a lot of blood plasma on the ship, so they feed the alien using that supply. When they are almost home, however, yet another crew member is eaten, a fight breaks out, and the alien is accidentally killed before she can finish the third guy. Phew! The ship lands on Earth, finally! But there is trouble... The two remaining astronauts find a lot of eggs when they are about to leave the ship. Obviously the alien was a kind of bee-queen whose sole purpose was to spread their species to Earth, where there is a lot of yummy food... One of the astronauts tries to warn the arriving scientists of this danger, but they could not care less. Being scientists, they know what they are doing, so they collect the eggs and run happily along. The astronaut sums it up: ""Well, at least I TRIED...""

Dr Farraday (Rathbone) decides to send a team of astronauts, including Allan Brenner (Saxon) and Paul Grant (Hopper), on a rescue mission. On the planet, they discover just one survivor. This green-skinned alien is brought aboard, but when one man is attacked and drained of his blood, the survivors are soon racing home, before they too become victim to the bloodsucker.

    Synopsis
    The movie opens with title and credits shown over watercolor paintings, consisting mostly of red, brown and black, of an other-worldly landscape (painting of John Cline). A narrator tells us, ""The year 1990, the problem of traveling to the moon has been solved for many years. Space stations have been built there and authorized personnel come and go as they wish, but the moon is a dead world. And the great question about space still remains, does life exist on another planet? To seek an answer to this question, the major powers of the world have been actively preparing at the International Institute of Space Technology to explore the planets Venus and Mars."" Allan Brenner (John Saxon) enters the Astro Communications office to see Laura James (Judi Meredith) for a lunch date. She has been monitoring signals believed to be from another planet in our galaxy.On an alien world, we see their sun set over a beach. Their counterparts to ours on Earth are sending signals out into space. Their technology is equal to, or greater than our own. Allan and Laura finish their lunch outside as Paul Grant (Dennis Hopper) on the left and Tony Barrata (Don Eitner) on the right join them at their table. They barely start their lunch when an announcement is made calling all personnel to assemble for an important message from Dr. Farraday (Basil Rathbone). The four are joined on their walk to the assembly by Cmdr. Anders Brockman (Robert Boon). Farraday tells the assembled that they have deciphered the message send by another civilization in space. An ambassador will be dispatched to Earth from their planet. On the alien planet a ship is prepared and launched. It is a spherical shaped craft with a belt of two metal tubes near the bottom. The aliens are human-like in their appearance. An alien probe is sent to Earth prior to the main ship's arrival and lands in the ocean. The capsule is retrieved and sent to the IIST labs for study. A record of the alien ship's entire flight is included in the probe. Farraday and his assistant (Forrest J. Ackerman) enter the Communications office and confer with Laura. Laura plays the alien transmission of their flight, including the crash landing on Mars. Farraday believes there may be survivors on the alien ship. Farraday calls a press conference for the next morning.Farraday proposes a rescue mission using the spaceship, Oceano, and to push up the schedule six months. Supply ships are sent to the moon. Farraday and his staff have moved to the moon to supervise the rescue mission. Laura is unhappy that Allan Brenner will not be on the Oceano rescue ship with her. The rescue ship is launched and Allan watches it depart in his spacesuit from the surface of the moon. Brockman reports a successful launch to Farraday. Brockman reads a book, as Paul Grant and Laura James get their meal. Before they can eat the ship encounters a sunburst that damages some of the ship's instruments. Laura contacts Farraday and reports that they have entered the orbit of Mars using emergency instruments. They begin their search for the alien's ship. They find it and report same to Farraday. The Oceano lands on Mars not far from the alien ship. Brockman and Grant don their space suits and walk over to the alien ship. Brockman enters the disabled alien craft only to discover the crew dead. Back on Earth, a newspaper headline announces, ""Successful Landing on Mars; Alien Spaceship Discovered."" Another article is titled, ""Single Dead Astronaut Found on Spacecraft; Mystery Deepens."" On the Moon base, Brenner and Tony Barrata propose taking the smaller rocket, Meteor, to Mars and deploying the search satellites immediately. Farraday explains that the Meteor can only carry a small amount of fuel, not enough to land on Mars, let alone return to Earth. Brenner explains they will land on Phobos, and then take the rescue ship to the surface and return on the Oceano. Farraday agrees to consider the plan. He finally agrees and the Meteor arrives in orbit around Mars. The satellite is deployed and the Meteor lands on the tiny moon, Phobos. Brockman calculates that the Meteor must depart within thirty minutes or they will be stuck on the tiny moon for a week. As luck would have it, the Meteor landed close to the other alien ship, the rescue ship, the one thought to have landed somewhere else on Mars. Brenner and Barrata walk to the rescue ship. They find the sole occupant, a woman in a spacesuit and carry her back to the Meteor. The Alien Queen (Florence Marly) is placed in a seat while Brenner and Barrata decide who will remain behind, as the craft can only carry two. Brenner crash lands on Mars and carries the Queen back to the Ocean. Brockman and Grant go out to find Brenner and the Queen, now lost in a sandstorm. The storm passes and Grant enters the Oceano carrying the Queen. She is wearing a red spacesuit that is quite form fitting. We can see her skin is a greenish color, but otherwise she is quite human in appearance. Laura asks, ""Paul, who brought her?"" Before Grant can answer, the door opens and Allan Brenner walks in. Brockman explains there is not enough fuel to stop on Phobos to retrieve Tony Barrata. He conveys his concern to Farraday who assures Brockman that a rescue ship will be dispatched to rescue Barrata, but Tony will need to conserve his emergency rations.The Alien Queen begins to come to.

Mrs. White, a widow, recluse and alcoholic, still treats her daughter like a child, although she pays her daughter little attention. However, Brydie is physically becoming a young woman.

                    Lew Harper is a Los Angeles based private investigator whose marriage to Susan Harper, who he still loves, is ending in imminent divorce since she can't stand being second fiddle to his work, which is always taking him away at the most inopportune of times. His latest client is tough talking and physically disabled Elaine Sampson, who wants him to find her wealthy husband, Ralph Sampson, missing now for twenty-four hours, ever since he disappeared at Van Nuys Airport after having just arrived from Vegas. No one seems to like Ralph, Elaine included. She believes he is cavorting with some woman, which to her would be more a fact than a problem. Harper got the case on the recommendation of the Sampsons' lawyer and Harper's personal friend, milquetoast Albert Graves, who is unrequitedly in love with Sampson's seductive daughter, Miranda Sampson. Miranda, who Harper later states throws herself at anything ""pretty in pants"", also has a decidedly cold relationship with her stepmother, Elaine. As Harper begins his investigation, he is often joined by one or two new sidekicks, Miranda, and/or Allan Taggert, Sampson's private pilot who was the last person to see him before his disappearance. Living on the Sampson estate, Allan is also Miranda's casual boyfriend who Harper coins ""Beauty"" because of his preppy good looks. They discover that Sampson has indeed been kidnapped as they receive a ransom note. As Harper follows leads, he ends up in the underbelly of Los Angeles society, which includes encounters with Betty Fraley, a junkie lounge singer, Fay Estabrook, an ex-movie ingénue now overweight alcoholic, and Claude, a religious cult leader. At each of Harper's stops, people seem to want to beat him up or worse kill him. The case takes a slight turn after they decide to pay the $500,000 ransom to see where it leads.

                    Coming of age story for two girls, Mary Clancy and Rachel Devery, who find themselves as students at the St. Francis Academy, a Catholic boarding school for girls. The story spans three years and follows the girls and their many pranks including setting off fire alarms, smoking cigars in the basement and putting bubble baths in the nuns' sugar bowls. As the girls mature, they gain a greater respect for their teachers and the commitment and devotion required to be a nun, leading one of them to make a life changing decision.

Mary is a hellion who's youthful spirits keep Mother Superior in a constant state of panic as she and her friend, Rachel Devery, substitute bubble bath for the nun's sugar, smoke cigars in the boiler room, and attempt to make a life-mask of the face of a fellow student with quick-hardening plaster. Through it all, Mother Superior is determined to salvage something of worth from the youthful clay.

He has sent her there to straighten her out as she is rebellious (among other things, she is a heavy smoker), and is always carrying out her dubious but ""scathingly brilliant ideas"". At St. Francis, she meets fellow student Rachel Devery, recently transferred from New Trends Progressive School. Rachel is a follower, Mary her leader. The two continually lead other students astray, especially Mary's cousin, her Uncle George's daughter, Marvel-Ann. They also butt heads with the school's equally strong willed Mother Superior. Mary and Rachel's antics bring them close to the verge of expulsion, but the Mother Superior feels she needs to be part of Mary's salvation as Mary's primary alternative, living with her womanizing Uncle George, is not even an option in the Mother Superior's view. Ultimately, Mary's inner curiosity and keen observances of life around her, supported unwittingly by the Mother Superior and the other Sisters, bring her to a turning point in her view of life at St. Francis, one at odds with her best friend.

                    Married couple George Adamson and Joy Adamson have long lived in northern Kenya for George's work as the senior game warden of the region. One of George's primary responsibilities is to deal with dangerous animals that may be chronically threatening to humans, livestock and/or crops. It is in this vein that George and his staff end up killing a man eating lion and its lioness, resulting in their three young female cubs being orphaned. Although difficult to begin, George and Joy are able to wean and take care of the three cubs, who they adopt as pets. But soon, they know they have to provide a more suitable environment for the cubs, namely sending them to Rotterdam Zoo... that is except for the smallest, who they have named Elsa and to who Joy in particular has become attached as the emotional fighter among the three. As Elsa grows into lioness maturity, George and Joy provide her with greater freedom away from their property, which may get her into trouble as a largely tame animal. Ultimately, John Kendall, George's boss, directs them to send Elsa to a zoo like they did with her sisters, especially as with anyone in George's job he is soon being reassigned. Joy cannot bear the thought of Elsa being locked up for the rest of her life, believing that they can reintegrate her back into the wild instead, something that had never been done with a tame lion. John gives them three months to accomplish this task, which most specifically involves getting Elsa to be able to kill for food, other creatures which up to this point she has seen only as fellow playthings, and to be accepted by other lions, most specifically mate with and provide food for a male partner while standing up successfully to female competitors.

"49","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060177/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The year is 1916, the third bloody year of the Great War. Somewhere within the desolate wasteland of the Western Front, young German infantryman Bruno Stachel (George Peppard) takes cover in a muddy trench and looks up to marvel at an aerial dogfight occurring overhead.Two years later, the ambitious Stachel has escaped the trenches and is now a fledgling lieutenant in the increasingly depleted Air Corps. He reports to an aerodrome in France and quickly realizes that he must struggle to be accepted by the aristocratic young airmen of his squadron. Stachel's modest upbringing is ridiculed by his high-born comrades, but in truth his background bothers him far more than it does his fellow airmen. On his first mission, Stachel and another flier shoot down a British observation balloon before being ambushed by a pair of British planes. Stachel's partner is shot down, but Bruno scores his first kill. The wreckage of the British plane remains undiscovered by German ground forces, so there is no official confirmation of Stachel's victory. Incensed, Stachel spends several hours fruitlessly searching for the wreckage. His fellow fliers resent his seeming lack of concern over the death of the other squadron member. When challenged about it, Stachel bitterly retorts that when he was confronted with frequent losses in the trenches there was no time to bury the dead, much less remember them over a glass of champagne.Voluntary patrol pairings are soon announced, and it is apparent that no one wants to fly with Stachel. The squadron's leading ace (and new holder of the coveted Blue Max award), Willi von Klugermann (Jeremy Kemp), eventually agrees to fly with Stachel. While on aerial patrol, Stachel and Willi spot a two-man British reconaissance plane far below them and Stachel attacks it. Stachel badly wounds the rear gunner and attempts to force the British pilot to land at the nearby German airfield. The enemy pilot seems to comply, but as the two planes approach the airfield, the British gunner regains consciousness and tries to open fire. Stachel puts a long burst into the plane and it crashes onto the field, killing both airmen. When Stachel lands, his commander insinuates that Stachel shot down the plane over the field so as to ensure credit for his kill. The other men stare at Stachel reproachfully. He angrily stalks over to the downed plane and carves out the section of canvas with the plane's identification number, throws it at the feet of the squadron adjutant, and smirks sarcastically as he says, ""Confirmed.""Stachel's squadron is soon reviewed in parade formation by General von Klugermann (James Mason), Willi's uncle. The general has brought along his young, beautiful, and voluptuous wife, Countess von Klugermann (Ursula Andress). She looks on admiringly as Willi is officially awarded his Blue Max (Pour Le Merite) medal. During the General's visit, it becomes obvious that rather than being ostracized for the recent shoot-down, Stachel is being positioned as a new kind of ruthless hero for propaganda purposes. The German people are war-weary after four long years, and a heroic, working class flier would serve as a powerful symbol.That night, the Countess comes to Willi's room for a late night visit but accidentally stumbles into Stachel's room next door. She unashamedly admits to an amused Stachel that she and the much older general have an open marriage, and she toys seductively with Bruno before departing for Willi's room.The Germans soon undertake a major new offensive, with the Air Corps lending support. Stachel soon has eight kills to his credit. On solitary patrol one day, Stachel notices a bright red German triplane flying far below him just as it is attacked by a pair of British planes. Stachel dives steeply to aid the triplane pilot and shoots down one of the enemy planes. But the remaining fighter is soon on his tail. A burst of gunfire wounds Stachel in the arm and knocks out his engine. Stachel crash lands in a field and jumps from his burning plane shortly before it explodes. The grateful pilot of the red triplane makes a low pass over Stachel and waggles his wings.Stachel is patched up by a German army medic before a truck arrives to pick him up. Stachel climbs in the back, only to find Willi waiting with a bottle of champagne. Willi congratulates Stachel on his tenth victory before pointedly asking what it's like to be shot down. The two wary rivals fence with each other before Stachel raises the stakes by bringing up the Countess. Willi takes the bait and declares that the Countess, like the 1903 vintage champagne, is a trophy that will prove hard to get. Stachel laughingly accepts the challenge.Back at the airfield, the red triplane is waiting. Baron von Richthofen thanks Stachel for saving his life and invites him to join his squadron. Surprisingly, Stachel declines, stating that he would prefer to prove himself where he started out. General von Klugermann now steps up his Home Front propaganda campaign by summoning the wounded Stachel to Berlin to inspect a sensational new monoplane. The high-performance machine is still deemed too risky to fly. Afterward, Stachel is taken to a hospital and carefully photographed as his injury is tended to. Later, he attends a dinner party at the home of the General. After the rest of the guests have departed, Stachel completes his conquest of the sensuous Countess.Back at the front, Stachel is dropped off at his airfield, where he presents the contemptuous Willi with a bottle of champagne, vintage 1903. Enraged, Willi promises Bruno that his insolence will cost him one day. If they weren't before, the two are now bitter enemies.Germany has now been forced onto the defensive. Willi and Bruno volunteer to escort a reconnaissance mission over British lines in the squadron's only pair of triplanes. They are soon jumped by a British patrol. When Stachel's guns jam, Willi downs the enemy planes on his own. Afterward, he taunts Stachel by rolling his aircraft completely around Bruno's plane. Willi then challenges Stachel to a deadly test of airmanship by executing a dangerous pass through the narrow arch of a bridge. Stachel, accepting the challenge, ups the ante with an even more dangerous low pass. Willi is daunted by the stunt but refuses to concede. He tries to repeat the maneuver and crashes to his death.Back at the field, Stachel is confronted by his commanding officer, Captain Heidemann (Karl Michael Vogler). He inquires about Willi and Stachel reports that he is dead. The captain seethes at Stachel's matter-of-fact attitude and says that Willi was the better man, to which Stachel angrily replies that his death would seem to prove otherwise. The adjutant then enters to announce that two enemy planes were shot down. Heidemann automatically credits the planes to Willi without even asking Stachel. Offended by the captain's reflexive assumption, Stachel foolishly asserts that they were his kills. The incredulous adjutant retorts that the armorer's report indicated that Stachel's guns jammed after only forty rounds were fired. It is obvious that Stachel has lied. Heidemann initially refuses to confirm Stachel's dubious victories, but General von Klugermann orders him to do so.At Willi's funeral, the icy Countess is curiously unmoved by his death, beyong being flattered that he died in a contest over her. When Stachel and the Countess meet for a tryst later that evening, Stachel foolishly confides to her that he claimed two of Willi's kills. Back in combat, Heidemann leads the squadron against large enemy troop formations. He stresses that their mission is to provide strafing and bombing support against the British, not to risk their planes in aerial combat. The German planes wreak havoc among the helpless Tommies. Their presence above the battlefield is uncontested and effective, but then British fighters suddenly appear above them. Heidemann uses hand signals to order the squadron back to base, but Stachel ignores the command and climbs to meet the enemy. One by one, his aggressive squadron mates follow him. A huge dogfight ensues, with numerous losses on both sides. Once on the ground, Heidemann is furious, raging at Stachel that his insubordination has cost half of the squadron. Stachel merely replies that they accounted for seven enemy planes, three of them his. His twenty-two victories have qualified him for the Blue Max, even without the two fraudulent kills. Heidemann swears that he will never wear the medal and vows to court-martial him.Stachel is ordered to Berlin along with Captain Heidemann. Upon their arrival, they encounter a city of long food lines and riots. Germany is in disarray. At headquarters, von Klugermann informs Heidemann that Stachel will receive the Blue Max. Over the Captain's strenuous objections, the General informs him that there will be no court-martial, as it could dishonor the German officer corps and weaken Germany's fragile morale.Stachel is treated to a luxurious hotel suite, where he soon receives a visit from the Countess. She explains that she is leaving- the handwriting is on the wall, Germany will lose the war, and she doesn't intend to stay around for the bitter aftermath. She asks Stachel to come with her, but he coldly informs her that he has no intention of running away to become one of her well-kept lap dogs. The Countess angrily storms from the room.Stachel receives the Blue Max at an airfield the following day. During the ceremonies, General von Klugermann receives a phone call from a Field Marshal. Stachel's unearned kills have come to light, via a petulant phone call from the Countess. Stachel is to be publicly disgraced. The General angrily confronts his vindictive wife, but the die is already cast.Captain Heidemann, who has just completed a test flight in the new monoplane, enters the airfield command shack to tell von Klugermann that the machine's structural design is seriously flawed. It is a death trap. The General dismises Heidemann and issues an immediate order to have Stachel sent up in the monoplane, with the added admonition to really put the airplane through her paces. Stachel puts on a dazzling display of aerobatics until the performance is abruptly ended by the loud rending of metal from high above. Stachel's plane enters a death spiral and crashes in the distance. His personnel file is officially stamped and closed as von Klugermann announces that Lieutenant Stachel died a hero.","
    
                    The tactics of a German fighter pilot offend his aristocratic comrades but win him his country's most honored medal, the Blue Max.

The two wary rivals fence with each other before Stachel raises the stakes by bringing up the Countess. Willi takes the bait and declares that the Countess, like the 1903 vintage champagne, is a trophy that will prove hard to get. Stachel laughingly accepts the challenge.Back at the airfield, the red triplane is waiting. Baron von Richthofen thanks Stachel for saving his life and invites him to join his squadron. Surprisingly, Stachel declines, stating that he would prefer to prove himself where he started out. General von Klugermann now steps up his Home Front propaganda campaign by summoning the wounded Stachel to Berlin to inspect a sensational new monoplane. The high-performance machine is still deemed too risky to fly. Afterward, Stachel is taken to a hospital and carefully photographed as his injury is tended to. Later, he attends a dinner party at the home of the General. After the rest of the guests have departed, Stachel completes his conquest of the sensuous Countess.Back at the front, Stachel is dropped off at his airfield, where he presents the contemptuous Willi with a bottle of champagne, vintage 1903. Enraged, Willi promises Bruno that his insolence will cost him one day. If they weren't before, the two are now bitter enemies.Germany has now been forced onto the defensive. Willi and Bruno volunteer to escort a reconnaissance mission over British lines in the squadron's only pair of triplanes. They are soon jumped by a British patrol. When Stachel's guns jam, Willi downs the enemy planes on his own. Afterward, he taunts Stachel by rolling his aircraft completely around Bruno's plane. Willi then challenges Stachel to a deadly test of airmanship by executing a dangerous pass through the narrow arch of a bridge. Stachel, accepting the challenge, ups the ante with an even more dangerous low pass. Willi is daunted by the stunt but refuses to concede. He tries to repeat the maneuver and crashes to his death.Back at the field, Stachel is confronted by his commanding officer, Captain Heidemann (Karl Michael Vogler). He inquires about Willi and Stachel reports that he is dead. The captain seethes at Stachel's matter-of-fact attitude and says that Willi was the better man, to which Stachel angrily replies that his death would seem to prove otherwise. The adjutant then enters to announce that two enemy planes were shot down. Heidemann automatically credits the planes to Willi without even asking Stachel. Offended by the captain's reflexive assumption, Stachel foolishly asserts that they were his kills. The incredulous adjutant retorts that the armorer's report indicated that Stachel's guns jammed after only forty rounds were fired. It is obvious that Stachel has lied. Heidemann initially refuses to confirm Stachel's dubious victories, but General von Klugermann orders him to do so.At Willi's funeral, the icy Countess is curiously unmoved by his death, beyong being flattered that he died in a contest over her. When Stachel and the Countess meet for a tryst later that evening, Stachel foolishly confides to her that he claimed two of Willi's kills. Back in combat, Heidemann leads the squadron against large enemy troop formations. He stresses that their mission is to provide strafing and bombing support against the British, not to risk their planes in aerial combat. The German planes wreak havoc among the helpless Tommies. Their presence above the battlefield is uncontested and effective, but then British fighters suddenly appear above them. Heidemann uses hand signals to order the squadron back to base, but Stachel ignores the command and climbs to meet the enemy. One by one, his aggressive squadron mates follow him. A huge dogfight ensues, with numerous losses on both sides. Once on the ground, Heidemann is furious, raging at Stachel that his insubordination has cost half of the squadron. Stachel merely replies that they accounted for seven enemy planes, three of them his. His twenty-two victories have qualified him for the Blue Max, even without the two fraudulent kills. Heidemann swears that he will never wear the medal and vows to court-martial him.Stachel is ordered to Berlin along with Captain Heidemann. Upon their arrival, they encounter a city of long food lines and riots. Germany is in disarray. At headquarters, von Klugermann informs Heidemann that Stachel will receive the Blue Max. Over the Captain's strenuous objections, the General informs him that there will be no court-martial, as it could dishonor the German officer corps and weaken Germany's fragile morale.Stachel is treated to a luxurious hotel suite, where he soon receives a visit from the Countess. She explains that she is leaving- the handwriting is on the wall, Germany will lose the war, and she doesn't intend to stay around for the bitter aftermath. She asks Stachel to come with her, but he coldly informs her that he has no intention of running away to become one of her well-kept lap dogs. The Countess angrily storms from the room.Stachel receives the Blue Max at an airfield the following day. During the ceremonies, General von Klugermann receives a phone call from a Field Marshal. Stachel's unearned kills have come to light, via a petulant phone call from the Countess. Stachel is to be publicly disgraced. The General angrily confronts his vindictive wife, but the die is already cast.Captain Heidemann, who has just completed a test flight in the new monoplane, enters the airfield command shack to tell von Klugermann that the machine's structural design is seriously flawed. It is a death trap. The General dismises Heidemann and issues an immediate order to have Stachel sent up in the monoplane, with the added admonition to really put the airplane through her paces. Stachel puts on a dazzling display of aerobatics until the performance is abruptly ended by the loud rending of metal from high above. Stachel's plane enters a death spiral and crashes in the distance. His personnel file is officially stamped and closed as von Klugermann announces that Lieutenant Stachel died a hero.

                    Writer/director Woody Allen explains that when he was asked to supervise the making of the definitive spy thriller, what he decided to do was acquire the rights to a B-grade Japanese spy caper (Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi (1965)) filmed with Japanese actors in Japanese, delete the existing soundtrack, and redub into English and reorder select scenes to create an entirely new movie, a comedy, having nothing to do with the original story-line. The result... International spy Phil Moscowitz, working out of the Asia bureau, is a self-professed lovable rogue with sex always on his mind. He inadvertently gets involved in a mission, the client the Grand Exalted High Majah of Raspur. The success of the mission will determine if Raspur, a non-existent country that nonetheless sounds real, will indeed become real. Moscowitz is to retrieve something stolen from the Majah by criminal Shepherd Wong: the best ever egg salad recipe. Phil is to be assisted by two of the Majah's own agents, sisters Teri and Suki Yaki, the latter a recent prison escapee. The mission becomes more difficult when they learn that Shepherd is an egg salad junkie who will do anything to keep the recipe. The mission gets even more complicated when they also learn that they are in competition to retrieve the recipe by Wing Fat, another criminal who plans to steal the recipe then sell it back to addicted Shepherd. The success or failure of the mission for Phil and the Yaki sisters may be dependent if they receive the extra help needed from the audience and the projectionist at the cinemas where the movie is playing.

    Synopsis
    This is a movie which needs to come around again. The USA is hurting for stories such as this. In a nutshell, an outsider named Lemuel Siddons wants so badly to become part of the community he volunteers to become the scoutmaster of a new Boy Scout troop...and over 40 years watches his scouts, their kids and grandkids all follow the path he blazed. He and the community come to realize he is part of them, and that he has become far more important in the grand scheme of life by guiding others to be good citizens/neighbors than he ever might have done by being a famous attorney.I'm going to throw in a gratuitous thank-you to George Stratton, first Scoutmaster of Troop 573 at Good Shepherd Church in West Springfield Mass. in 1965 or 1966 or thereabouts. I'm sure your nephews Gorden and Dave (Ventulett) grew up on the straight & narrow. Thanks to you, so did I. You were like a second dad. I just wish I could find a diner as good as the one you used to take us to, down at Westfield St. and Dewey St. near the tracks....those were the most glorious greasy, oniony cheeseburgers I ever tasted.

                    After an Egyptian army, commanded by British officers, is destroyed in a battle in the Sudan in the 1880's, the British government is in a quandary. It does not want to commit a British military force to a foreign war but they have a commitment to protect the Egyptians in Khartoum. They decide to ask General Charles ""Chinese"" Gordon, something of a folk hero in the Sudan as he had cleared the area of the slave trade, to arrange for the evacuation. Gordon agrees but also decides to defend the city against the forces of the Mahdi - the expected one - and tries to force the British to commit troops.

Even with the infamous Berlin Wall these escapes are common and successful.Colonel Stok (Oskar Homolka), the head of intelligence in Russia's Berlin section and the one responsible for preventing escapes over the Wall, contacts British Intelligence and informs them that he wants to defect to the West. British spy Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) is sent to West Berlin to find out if Stok's offer is genuine and arrange his escape. Palmer was once involved in black market dealings in Berlin and was given the choice of joining British Intelligence or going to jail. Returning to the city, he is re-united with his old associate, German national Johnny Vulkan (Paul Hubschmid), who also works for Palmer's superior Colonel Ross (Guy Doleman).Vulkan arranges for Palmer to go to East Berlin to meet Colonel Stok. In exchange for his co-operation with the British, Stok requests a meagre stipend, a house in the country and his escape must be carried out by Kreutzmann (Günter Meisner), a Berlin gangster responsible for the most successful escapes. Stok claims that Kreutzmann's escapes have lead his department to be investigated and that he must get out before things turn nasty.Returning to West Berlin, Palmer is picked up by a beautiful young woman called Samantha Steel (Eva Renzi), who invites him to a party but instead takes him to her flat for drinks, dinner and presumably more as Palmer is next seen leaving her place in the morning. Not taken in by Samantha's charms, Palmer hires a burglar to search her apartment to figure out who she really is. The thief discovers a number of passports of various nationalities under different variations of her name and a little black book in her safe which lists names of men next to million-dollar figures. Returning to his hotel room, Palmer finds that it too has been ransacked.Palmer negotiates an arrangement with Kreutzmann without revealing the details of the one whom the British want to get across the Wall. As part of his payment, Kreutzmann demands a set of identity papers.Palmer tests Stok in order to determine how sincere he is about defecting. The test seems conclusive and Palmer returns to London. From Hallam (Hugh Burden), the documents manager back at MI5, Palmer receives documents in the name of Paul Louis Broum. As he places the envelope in his briefcase for return to Berlin, he notices the same name on the photocopy of Samantha's little black book, with the figure $2,000,000 next to it.Palmer returns to Samantha and makes a point of letting her see the envelope with Broum's name. Dropping all pretence, she admits that she is an Israeli agent. Broum is a Nazi war criminal who stole millions from the Jews during the war and hid it in a Swiss bank account. The Israelis need the papers in order to reclaim the money. Although she threatens to kill him, Palmer refuses to give her the documents since he needs them to pay Kreutzmann.Kreutzmann and his men murder an elderly East Berliner whose body is claimed by a relative in the West - actually someone employed by Kreutzmann. A body transfer is arranged but as the hearse makes its way from the morgue to the checkpoint, it is hijacked by Kreutzmann's men and replaced with another which contains a different coffin.The coffin is taken to West Berlin and delivered to an abandoned warehouse where Palmer and his associate Vulkan are waiting. But when the coffin in opened it is found to contain the dead body of Kreutzmann! Stok's whole defection was simply a bluff to lure Kreutzmann out and put an end to the escapes he so brilliantly organised. Although well informed, he and his men never knew in advance that Stok was the intended client.Before Palmer can get away from Kreutzmann's outraged accomplices, he is knocked unconscious by Vulkan who gets hold of the Broum documents only to be held up by Samantha and two other Israeli agents who take away the papers.Vulkan tells Palmer that he was knocked out by another of Kreutzmann's men. They then go to a safe house where British officials are waiting to debrief Stok. Stok of course is not there, meaning that a lot of valuable time and money has been wasted. Palmer's boss, Colonel Ross, is also present and Palmer tells him about the Broum documents. Ross was unaware that they were being used as part of the deal with Kreutzmann. He then reveals to Palmer that towards the end of the war, Paul Louis Broum, a guard at a concentration camp, murdered a resistance fighter called Johnny Vulkan and assumed his identity. Ross got hold of the documents and used them to blackmail Broum into working for him.Now that the documents are missing, Ross has nothing with which to keep a hold on Broum/Vulkan and cannot risk him defecting. He therefore orders Palmer to kill Broum. Palmer won't kill anyone in cold blood and allows Broum/Vulkan to get away.Back in West Berlin, Palmer meets Stok who is over for a routine meeting with his Western counterparts. The affable Russian confirms that his supposed defection was just a trap to get rid of Kreutzmann. He and Palmer even joke about the latter himself defecting to the East; Stok advises: ""If you need to get out in a hurry, ask Vulkan.

                    British industrialist Sir William Rutland - ""Bill"" to his friends - is in Tokyo on a business trip during the time of the Summer Olympic Games there in 1964. Having actually arrived in Tokyo two days before his original planned arrival, he has problems finding a hotel room because of the Olympics. Spotting an ad posted on a British Embassy message board of a room available to sublet, Bill is able to wrangle his way into the apartment of Christine Easton, who is renting out the sitting room of her one-bedroom apartment as a bedroom for the duration of the Olympics. Bill's short-term living situation in Christine's sitting room is despite her solely wanting a female roommate. Soon thereafter, Bill meets Steve Davis, an athlete with the American Olympic team who seems to be reluctant to disclose in which event he is competing. Like Bill, Steve has arrived in Tokyo two days early of his scheduled arrival, has nowhere to stay for those two days, and without Christine's knowledge also wrangles his way into Christine's flat to share her sitting room with Bill as Bill sublets half of the sitting room to Steve. Christine is reluctant to tell anyone of her new roommates because of the perceived impropriety. Those not in the know include her fiancé of twenty-two months, Julius D. Haversack, the Second Secretary to the Minister of Protocol at the British Embassy. Bill, who has met Mr. Haversack, considers him to be officious and obnoxious. Despite Christine being in a relationship with Mr. Haversack, she and Steve gradually fall for each other. Seeing what is happening between Christine and Steve, Bill does whatever he can to push the two together and to get Mr. Haversack out of the way. When the truth comes out about the roommate situation, Bill sees a different opportunity for Christine and Steve's joint happiness.

                    Vineyard owner marquis Philippe de Montfaucon is called back to his castle Bellenac because of another dry season. He asks his wife and children to remain in Paris, but they still come after him. His wife Catherine de Montfaucon soon discovers that her husband is acting mysteriously and that his employees are following old pagan rituals that call for the life of the marquis himself to save the crops.

                    The family of the Marquis, Philippe de Montfaucon, has long been the major landowner in Bellenac, a wine growing region in France. Philippe heads back to the family vineyard from his home in Paris when he learns that there are problems in the fields threatening the crops. Against Philippe's wishes, his wife, the Marquise, Catherine de Montfaucon, with their two adolescent children, Jacques and Antoinette, decides to follow Philippe back to Bellenac. There, Catherine sees what she believes is disturbing behavior. Young adult siblings, Christian and Odile de Caray, whose family has also lived in the region for generations, have been hanging around the estate. While Catherine witnesses Christian killing a dove with a bow and arrow, which he seems always to be brandishing, Odile seems to have this hypnotic power over anyone in her sights. What's worse is that Philippe seems to be in a transfixed state while in Bellenac. Although Catherine and the children's lives are threatened while in Bellenac by the actions of Christian and Odile, she decides to stay just to figure out what is happening and to save Philippe, who too seems like he is under some threat. When Catherine eventually learns what is going on and why Philippe didn't want her to come to Bellenac, it may be too late to save Philippe and perhaps Jacques from their evil destiny, as was the fate of seemingly many of the men of the de Montfaucon family in Bellenac over the generations.

                    A freighter is attacked by a giant octopus during a stormy night. The octopus is then attacked buy a hairy green giant. The gargantua then turns his attention to the ship and sinks it killing and eating all the crew except for one. When the surviving crew member tells the police what happened, they call in Doctor Paul Stewart and his assistant Akemi. Several years earlier, Stewart had a younger species of the same creature and it is feared that the monster has grown up and now views man as an enemy. After several attacks, the monster is cornered in a forest in a mountain area of Japan, and is nearly killed when shot with lasers and nearly electrocuted. Just before it dies a second, bigger brown monster arrives and saves it. This is the creature that Stewart had at his lab now all grown up to over 100 feet tall. The brown one then takes the green monster away to help it recover, not knowing his ""brother's"" evil nature. The army then dubs the brown monster Sanda and the green one Gaira. After the green monster recovers sufficiently, he resumes his rampage. But when he stops to rest, the brown one finds out how evil his brother is and soon the two begin to fight. The green one then runs off and soon heads for Tokyo. Stewart and Akemi must now try to save Sanda before the army kills him along with his evil brother.

                    Japanese version: The sole survivor of a Japanese fishing boat is hospitalized in extreme shock, and later tells a story that no one wants to believe. In the woods, campers and hikers disappear and leave only chewed-up clothes, and other people report sightings of hairy giants. An American scientist investigates, then a Japanese scientist recounts what happened years earlier in Furankenshutain tai chitei kaijû Baragon (1965). He had found a mutated feral boy with a flat head, named it Frankenstein, and it grew 20 feet tall, rampaged, and was destroyed. Now there is another Frankenstein, only it is 100 feet tall with brown fur all over. There also is a second monster just like it, only with green skin and fur, and it eats people. Both had grown out of fragments of the first monster's body. Both Frankensteins are nearly indestructible, both team up against the armed forces, and more monsters can grow from them. Then these Frankensteins turn against each other and wage a battle to the bitter end, with the city of Tokyo as their battle arena. American version: same as above, only the monsters are named Gargantuas, the green Gargantua had grown from a piece of the brown Gargantua's body, and the brown Gargantua's origin is unknown.

                    In this sprawling, star-laden film, we see the struggles of various French resistance factions to regain control of Paris near the end of World War II. The Nazi general in charge of Paris, Dietrich von Cholitz (Fröbe), is under orders from Hitler himself to burn the city if he cannot control it or if the Allies get too close. Much of the drama centers around the moral deliberations of the general, the Swedish ambassador (Welles), and the eager but desperate leaders of the resistance.

                    In June 1933, eight young women, who are close friends and members of the upper-class group at South Tower College, to graduate and start their adult lives. The film documents the years between their graduation and the beginning of the Second World War in Europe, and shows, in a serialized style, their romances and marriages, their searches for careers or meaning in their lives, their highs and their lows.

                    The lives of a group of eight friends, who are seen as the aesthetes of the Vassar class of 1933, are presented from their graduation, when their lives held so much promise despite the Depression, to the start of WWII. Ambitious theater major Kay, somewhat the outsider of the group, decides to get married immediately and support her struggling playwright husband Harald by getting a job at Macy's than pursue her own theater directing career. Kay, who takes everything personally, needs to be in control, which becomes more difficult as problems emerge in the marriage and as world events occur around her. The only one who may be more ambitious is English major Libby, who wants a job in publishing and whose bravada hides her insecurities when not getting what she wants. The exact opposite is Dottie, an inexperienced proper Bostonian who may settle for second best much as she strove for what she really wanted despite she coming to the understanding that she was less than second best. Chemistry major Polly, who wanted to be a doctor but becomes a medical technician, deals with people with real or perceived psychological problems, both at work and in her personal life. Politically involved Priss knows that love and politics may not mesh, but doesn't like feeling like a science experiment as a replacement to love. Artist Helena, who plans on becoming a nursery school teacher, is the communicator who reports the goings-on of her friends to their other classmates. Wealthy Pokey can afford a life of leisure in marriage, for which she strives. And beautiful art history major Lakey, who can get any man she wants, heads to Europe following graduation to further her art history experience, but her trip may be as much to get away from her Vassar life and head for freedom.

Mr. Leamington, her father's boss (James Mason), is stuck in a loveless marriage with a sickly wife (Rachel Kempson) and believes he has found a lonely woman in Georgy whom he can set up as his mistress. Some of the most clever scenes are when Georgy successfully stiff-arms Mr. Leamington and keeps him at bay. She is at her most vulnerable juxtaposed with her pretty roommate, Meredith (Charlotte Rampling), a tramp who has had many boyfriends and abortions. When Meredith turns up pregnant once again and decides to have the baby, Georgy's path in life becomes clear even to Georgy, despite a coming-of-age detour with Meredith's boyfriend-cum-husband Jos (Alan Bates).

"76","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060548/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The action takes place on Petrie's Island, off the east coast of Ireland--isolated, with a small village peopled with farmers and fishermen, with one constable, a ""head"" whose job is quite informal, and one doctor. Dr. Lawrence Phillips (Peter Forbes-Robertson) comes to the island and sets up a sophisticated laboratory, the most wonderous thing of its kind the islanders have ever seen, in a isolated mansion on the island's peninsula. Dr. Phillips and his number-one assistant Carson (Richard Bidlake) supervise the unloading of what turns out to be the last of their equipment. Watching from nearby, Peter Argyle (James Caffrey), the keeper of the general store, chats with Roger Campbell (Niall McGinnis), the ""head"" or mayor of the island; Constable John Harris (Sam Kydd); Dr. Reginald Landers (Eddie Byrne); and Ian Bellows (Liam Gaffney), an ordinary farmer. The most remarkable thing about Dr. Phillips is that he is a recluse. Dr. Landers explains that away by saying that all researchers close themselves off from contact from any human beings except their own teams and staffs. Ian and John remark to Mr. Campbell about all the promises that ""the mainland"" has made to the islanders, but never kept, because the tax revenues from the island are so little.In the laboratory, Dr. Phillips tells Carson that they will begin, without co-ordinating with their Rome, New York, and Tokyo teams. Phillips questions Carson quite closely on the state of their equipment. Finally he announces to his team that he will proceed with a revolutionary process that, he is absolutely sure, will yield the dream of the medical sciences: a successful and unfailing treatment for cancer.With that, he turns to. Then as the screen turns blood-red, the sound of breaking glass breaks out--as if to suggest a dangerous...something...breaching containment. A sequence no more than a frame or two long--a subliminal cut--shows Dr. Phillips and his two assistants lying dead on the laboratory floor, and the breached containment vessel. And then the main title begins.The action resumes, presumably that evening. The fog that Peter Argyle confidently predicted (""If you weren't a newcomer, you'd feel it in your bones.""), has rolled in. Ian Bellows, carrying a lantern, reconnoiters a cave on his land near the Phillips house. Suddenly he hears an odd-sounding noise, mostly in the base register, and sounding like nothing so much as a kind of atonal music, weak on melody but strong on deep, pulsing rhythm with haunting sussurations. He walks into the cave--and then gives out a loud outcry. It is the last sound he utters. The next sound that comes from that cave is a sound very much like the one a child makes as he rudely slurps up the last dregs of a thickshake through a straw.His wife (Joyce Hemson) waits impatiently for Ian to come home. When he does not, she goes to Harris' house to complain and express her concern. Harris goes to the cave to investigate. He finds Bellows, or what's left of him--soft, flabby, face caved in, eyes and tongue bulging out. At once he fetches Dr. Landers, who asks Harris to help him take the unfortunate Bellows to the island clinic. There he performs a complete autopsy, that reveals little. Yes, it is Bellows, for apart from his clothes, Landers recognizes an old appendectomy scar that he, Dr. Landers, gave Bellows once. But Bellows' entire skeleton is simply missing.Landers first calls on Dr. Phillips, but no one answers the door. So Landers takes the emergency launch to the mainland, where he then gets more conventional transport to London. There he seeks out Dr. Brian Stanley (Peter Cushing), the most eminent pathologist in all the British Isles. Stanley admits that a case of a man with no bones has him stumped. He suggests they seek out Dr. David West (Edward Judd), orthopedic surgeon and the most eminent specialist in management of diseases of the bone.Dr. West is at this moment entertaining a flighty young lady, Toni Merrill (Carole Gray). She recently became his patient after she smashed up her Maserati and landed in the emergency suite while he, West, was the attending-on-call. After her discharge, West had her up to his flat for dinner--where he managed to spill wine on her dress. (Whether that was his fault or hers, the story never makes clear.) So when we first see Toni, she is wearing one of David West's shirts, and nothing else, and flirting outrageously with him. The truth of the matter is that Toni Merrill is the type one will find in all of Western civilization: a spoiled rich girl. And she has set her sights on West, primarily because she finds him dashingly attractive.In the middle of this flirtatious session, West's doorbell rings. West tells Toni where she can find his dressing gown, and then answers the door to admit Stanley and Landers. Toni, not shy in the least, comes out, and does not mind being the center of attention. She listens as Landers and Stanley explain their problem to West. The problem fascinates West, who would very much like to see Bellows' body for himself. The three men decide they ought to fly back, but how? Then Toni offers to prevail on her father to lend them his helicopter--on condition they take her with them on what she is sure to be a marvelous adventure. West is reluctant, but Stanley and Landers point out that time is of the essence. So West accepts her bargain.The four prepare to fly to the island, but their pilot tells them they can't expect him to wait, because Toni's father has need of the helicopter. So they will be effectively marooned. In the conversation that follows, they speak of solitaire, and Toni says she has a more interesting game in mind. Let the viewer interpret that however (s)he likes.The four fly to the island, and Constable Harris and a hunter named Dunley (Roger Heathcote) greet them.The first thing Landers does is take Stanley and West to the clinic and show them Bellows' body--which Stanley pronounces ""not a pretty sight."" The three perform more thorough tests, which yield a strange finding: micro-punctures, or micro-ruptures, all over the skin. As if something, or someone, injected something into the body--or sucked it out. They cannot tell which.Finding the clinic facility woefully inadequate to the task of conducting a proper autopsy, the three men then set out for the mansion of the reclusive Dr. Phillips. (Landers takes time to write a note to Constable Harris that he may find him there should he need to speak to him.) There they find Dr. Phillips' butler, his two assistants, and Phillips himself, all nastily dead, and all showing the same horrific disfigurement as Bellows. Stanley concludes: Phillips managed to concoct something in his laboratory that got loose, killed him and his team and butler, and then killed Bellows. And might kill any number of other people.To find out what, Stanley and West gather up all of Dr. Phillips' notes, to take them to the inn to study at greater leisure. But while they are doing this, Farmer Morton (Shay Gorman) discovers one of his horses dead, soft, and flabby. He reports this to Harris, who then sets out, on the strength of the note, to find Dr. Landers and speak to him. So Harris goes to Phillips' house alone, and finds pretty much the same things Stanley, West, and Landers have already found. And then, as he goes into the cellar, he now hears, for the first time, that strange, ominous, atonal, rhythmic and sussurating music. He follows it into the room that once housed test animals--and there a tentacle, with suckers on it like those on an octopus, snags him under his chin and causes him to cry out in pain. It is his last cry.The next morning, Landers goes to call on Harris but does not find him. Landers then goes to the general store, where he finds Peter and Morton. Morton informs Landers of his dead horse, and that he had told Harris about it. Landers notes that this happened on ""the other side of the island,"" then rushes off--abruptly enough that Morton and Peter wonder about ""strange goings-on."" Peter decides to go see Mr. Campbell; this is something the Head of the island ought to know about.Campbell is not pleased at this news. He takes Peter with him to talk to some other farmers, see what they might have seen, and then go see Dr. Landers.Landers returns to the inn and gathers up Stanley, West, and now Toni Merrill, who insists on coming along. They stop by the farm to investigate the dead horse. Toni stays in the motorcar--and hears the strange music, and then, through the rear window, sees a horrible-looking mass of suckers slide past! She shrieks. The men come running and take her account, which doesn't amount to much, except that what she saw frightened her very badly.The four drive to the Phillips house, where this time they agree to take Toni with them--they now deal with a hazard that they can best defend against if they all stay together. Once inside, they descend into the cellar, where they find Harris--dead and flabby, like all the rest. And there, for the first time, they all hear the music that Toni heard, and then see what can only be the creature, or creatures, that Dr. Phillips created.Each creature is two meters across and flat to the ground. It looks like a turtle that moves on a base of suckers instead of conventional legs. It has a single tentacle that comes out of the front of its armor-plated dorsum and seems to act as combination sensor and prehensile manipulator. The four retreat from it, only to find a second such creature moving in from another corridor. Cornered by this obviously coordinated attack, the three back against a wall that happens to house the fire-fighting equipment. Dr. Landers takes down the fire ax and takes a swing at the creature in front of them. Not a scratch. He pulls back to take another swing, when the creature snags his ankle with its tentacle. Landers cries out in pain, again and again, and falls prone across the creature--and then, before everyone' horrified eyes, turns soft and flabby. Toni can't take it; she buries her face in West's chest and clings to him tightly.Now the creatures move in for the kill--and then stop. And then they divide, looking very much the way cells caught in mitotic anaphase do under a microscope--except that these creatures are two meters across! Happily, they go inert during this process, and that gives Stanley, West and Toni time to escape--though Toni is so badly frightened that West has to drag her along. The three rush from the house, only to see another of those creatures prowling about in the yard. They pile into their car--which won't start. West pops the hood and barely manages to fix the problem, close the hood, jump back into the car, start the engine, and drive off before that creature can overtake them.Back at the inn, West gives Toni a mild sedative and apologizes to her for bringing her to the island and exposing her to the hazard. She in turn apologizes for being so much trouble.Meanwhile, Campbell and Peter Argyle return to the general store. There they meet Dunley, who wants to know about an order of guns he had placed. Peter asks Dunley whether he has seen Dr. Landers--apparently he and Campbell haven't found him. Dunley says that Landers ""left"" at 7:00 in the morning, with three strangers--two men and a girl. Strangers who landed on the island by helicopter the night before. This is the first time Campbell has heard of three strangers on his island, all working with Dr. Landers, and now he is irritated. Taking Peter with him, they set out for the inn, where they might find all the strangers.West and Stanley return to studying Phillips' notes, when Campbell and Argyle walk in. The two doctors bravely admit that Dr. Landers is dead, and so is Constable Harris (and Ian Bellows), and that the island, its entire populace included, are in serious danger. Campbell reluctantly agrees to summon all the inhabitants to the village meeting hall, which adjoins the clinic.Campbell assembles everyone, as West and Stanley have suggested. Then Stanley and West, having finished studying the Phillips notes, address the villagers. Their story is dire: Phillips, in trying to create a culture of artificial killer cells that could attack cancer in a patient's body, instead created a creature of an entirely different order: one based on silicon rather than carbon, to which Stanley gives the name ""Silicate."" These creatures dine on animal and human bone. They inject a powerful enzyme cocktail into the body to liquefy the skeleton, and then suck this out of the body, using the suckers on their tentacles and ventral surfaces. The first such creature broke containment, killed Phillips and his team and staff, and then killed Bellows. And worse yet: these silicates reproduce by fission (which is what Stanley, West, and Toni witnessed) every six hours. There are sixty-four silicates on the island at present--and at six o'clock that evening there will be 128, and at midnight 256, and in three days there'll be a million of them (this after twenty fission cycles total, including the six that have already taken place; we may assume that Phillips and company died shortly before midnight the day before yesterday, and Bellows soon thereafter).West proposes the obvious: ""deny them food."" He suggests all the villagers camp out in the meeting hall and prepare for a siege. Then Campbell recruits a ten-member militia to try to attack the first wave of the silicates now approaching the village from the direction of the Phillips house. Morton, Dunley, and Halsey (Keith Bell) are among them. Reluctantly Toni Merrill stays behind--and ironically she finds herself in charge of keeping the villagers organized and, more importantly still, busy.Campbell sends Dunley to take two other men and scout three specific spots on the northern shore of the island. The rest of the island militia, with Stanley and West to accompany them, meet the wave of silicates, using long guns, Molotov cocktails (called ""petrol bombs""), and finally dynamite. Morton dies when he gets too close, and all their measures prove futile.But then Dunley rushes up to inform them that he has found one of the silicates--dead!--and Dr. Phillips' pet Great Dane, half-eaten. Stanley and West drive to the site, with Dunley to guide them. They confirm that they have a dead silicate, loaded with radioactive material, and also the Phillips dog, just as radioactive. (Phillips had written in his log that his dog had gotten an overdose of Strontium-90, a radionuclide that bones would take up.) They drive back to the clinic and meeting hall, where West informs the populace that they might have a means to kill the silicates, but will need the help of everyone present. He then instructs Toni to keep the people busy, while he and Stanley examine their specimen. The dorsal armor is impenetrable, of course, but they are acutely sensitive to radiation poisoning. West then proposes that he and Stanley return to the Phillips house and lab to collect a supply of Strontium-90 and a pressure gun for injecting large animals with. They instruct Campbell to gather the villagers' cattle in his cattle yard to keep them away from the silicates, until they have time to inject them all with strontium. (They then say that if West and Stanley fail in their mission, Campbell and Argyle will have to get the strontium. Peter protests his ignorance, but Campbell tells him not to borrow trouble.)The mission to recover the strontium and the injector succeeds--but West must use the fallen fire ax to cut off Stanley's left hand when a silicate attacks him as they make their escape. West barely manages to apply a tourniquet and then get Stanley back to the clinic. There West, now indisputably in command, operates on Stanley (here Toni assists him as his scrub nurse) and prepares to inject the cattle. He manages to inject them all--except that he must cut the dose of strontium for the last several steers so that he does not run out.Campbell has a problem of his own: Halsey. He has the face to propose, and to an old woman (Margaret Lacey) yet, that they swim for it. Campbell tells Halsey to shut his mouth, assures the people that waiting inside the building is the safest course, and then takes Halsey aside. Speaking as sternly as he knows how, he tells Halsey that if he says one more word, he, Campbell, will knock him out and toss him outside to the silicates.At 2330 hours Irish time, the silicates gorge themselves on the cattle. And then they ""mitose"" for the last cycle. About 200 silicates (probably 224, accounting for one of them dying after the third fission cycle) then attack the building.The lights, over-strained when Campbell and his men strung several lights at the cattle yard, now fail. Toni rushes in breathlessly to ask David what happened to the lights; David tells her that they need to set an example of calm. Halsey panics, says he is ""not staying here,"" and makes for the door--only to meet Peter Argyle, long gun in hand, blocking his way. Campbell does more than that: he fires a gun into the air to get everyone's attention, and instructs everyone to move away from the windows and doors.Three silicates break in through a side window, wrap their tentacles around Halsey, and kill him. Another silicate slithers up the wall, then across the roof, and then onto a skylight, which it then crashes through, killing Dunley beneath it. Campbell now orders everyone out of the room and into the clinic--and must slam the door on an unknown number of villagers when the choice is either them or all the rest! Hastily they barricade themselves in the clinic, only to wait for the silicates, their music now including a high treble cry, to start battering their way in. Toni Merrill, now reduced to a quivering mass of flesh, takes comfort in Stanley's right arm, while West prepares a fatal dose of morphine to use on her to spare her a horrible death. He is just about to ram the needle home when Campbell calls out that the silicates seem to be weakening.Sure enough, that dreadful music is diminishing in volume, loses the triumphal treble quality, and finally falls silent, as the last of the tentacles flop to the floor beyond the door. West waits fifteen seconds, then asks some men to take down the barricade. Setting his teeth, he flings wide the doors, only to see silicate after silicate lying on the corridor floor, dead. He announces his find, and Toni rushes into his arms.The next morning, Mr. Merrill's helicopter comes back to take them off. West promises Campbell that he will send a large crew to clean up the island and bury the dead. (Peter Argyle confirms to Stanley that he and his remaining friends searched the island and found not a single living silicate.) Toni Merrill is obviously a bit wiser for her wear. West tells her not to scare herself all over again, and then observes that they were lucky this happened on an island, otherwise they might never have been able to destroy these creatures.But evidently they have forgotten, for the moment, the part of Phillips' notes where he mentions that similar teams are working in Rome, New York City, and Tokyo. And in the very last scene, a scientist in the Tokyo lab hears the eerie pulsating and sussurating music, goes into his lab to investigate, and cries out in horror as he dies the same kind of death we have already seen....","

There are sixty-four silicates on the island at present--and at six o'clock that evening there will be 128, and at midnight 256, and in three days there'll be a million of them (this after twenty fission cycles total, including the six that have already taken place; we may assume that Phillips and company died shortly before midnight the day before yesterday, and Bellows soon thereafter).West proposes the obvious: ""deny them food."" He suggests all the villagers camp out in the meeting hall and prepare for a siege. Then Campbell recruits a ten-member militia to try to attack the first wave of the silicates now approaching the village from the direction of the Phillips house. Morton, Dunley, and Halsey (Keith Bell) are among them. Reluctantly Toni Merrill stays behind--and ironically she finds herself in charge of keeping the villagers organized and, more importantly still, busy.Campbell sends Dunley to take two other men and scout three specific spots on the northern shore of the island. The rest of the island militia, with Stanley and West to accompany them, meet the wave of silicates, using long guns, Molotov cocktails (called ""petrol bombs""), and finally dynamite. Morton dies when he gets too close, and all their measures prove futile.But then Dunley rushes up to inform them that he has found one of the silicates--dead!--and Dr. Phillips' pet Great Dane, half-eaten. Stanley and West drive to the site, with Dunley to guide them. They confirm that they have a dead silicate, loaded with radioactive material, and also the Phillips dog, just as radioactive. (Phillips had written in his log that his dog had gotten an overdose of Strontium-90, a radionuclide that bones would take up.) They drive back to the clinic and meeting hall, where West informs the populace that they might have a means to kill the silicates, but will need the help of everyone present. He then instructs Toni to keep the people busy, while he and Stanley examine their specimen. The dorsal armor is impenetrable, of course, but they are acutely sensitive to radiation poisoning. West then proposes that he and Stanley return to the Phillips house and lab to collect a supply of Strontium-90 and a pressure gun for injecting large animals with. They instruct Campbell to gather the villagers' cattle in his cattle yard to keep them away from the silicates, until they have time to inject them all with strontium. (They then say that if West and Stanley fail in their mission, Campbell and Argyle will have to get the strontium. Peter protests his ignorance, but Campbell tells him not to borrow trouble.)The mission to recover the strontium and the injector succeeds--but West must use the fallen fire ax to cut off Stanley's left hand when a silicate attacks him as they make their escape. West barely manages to apply a tourniquet and then get Stanley back to the clinic. There West, now indisputably in command, operates on Stanley (here Toni assists him as his scrub nurse) and prepares to inject the cattle. He manages to inject them all--except that he must cut the dose of strontium for the last several steers so that he does not run out.Campbell has a problem of his own: Halsey. He has the face to propose, and to an old woman (Margaret Lacey) yet, that they swim for it. Campbell tells Halsey to shut his mouth, assures the people that waiting inside the building is the safest course, and then takes Halsey aside. Speaking as sternly as he knows how, he tells Halsey that if he says one more word, he, Campbell, will knock him out and toss him outside to the silicates.At 2330 hours Irish time, the silicates gorge themselves on the cattle. And then they ""mitose"" for the last cycle. About 200 silicates (probably 224, accounting for one of them dying after the third fission cycle) then attack the building.The lights, over-strained when Campbell and his men strung several lights at the cattle yard, now fail. Toni rushes in breathlessly to ask David what happened to the lights; David tells her that they need to set an example of calm. Halsey panics, says he is ""not staying here,"" and makes for the door--only to meet Peter Argyle, long gun in hand, blocking his way. Campbell does more than that: he fires a gun into the air to get everyone's attention, and instructs everyone to move away from the windows and doors.Three silicates break in through a side window, wrap their tentacles around Halsey, and kill him. Another silicate slithers up the wall, then across the roof, and then onto a skylight, which it then crashes through, killing Dunley beneath it. Campbell now orders everyone out of the room and into the clinic--and must slam the door on an unknown number of villagers when the choice is either them or all the rest! Hastily they barricade themselves in the clinic, only to wait for the silicates, their music now including a high treble cry, to start battering their way in. Toni Merrill, now reduced to a quivering mass of flesh, takes comfort in Stanley's right arm, while West prepares a fatal dose of morphine to use on her to spare her a horrible death. He is just about to ram the needle home when Campbell calls out that the silicates seem to be weakening.Sure enough, that dreadful music is diminishing in volume, loses the triumphal treble quality, and finally falls silent, as the last of the tentacles flop to the floor beyond the door. West waits fifteen seconds, then asks some men to take down the barricade. Setting his teeth, he flings wide the doors, only to see silicate after silicate lying on the corridor floor, dead. He announces his find, and Toni rushes into his arms.The next morning, Mr. Merrill's helicopter comes back to take them off. West promises Campbell that he will send a large crew to clean up the island and bury the dead. (Peter Argyle confirms to Stanley that he and his remaining friends searched the island and found not a single living silicate.) Toni Merrill is obviously a bit wiser for her wear. West tells her not to scare herself all over again, and then observes that they were lucky this happened on an island, otherwise they might never have been able to destroy these creatures.But evidently they have forgotten, for the moment, the part of Phillips' notes where he mentions that similar teams are working in Rome, New York City, and Tokyo. And in the very last scene, a scientist in the Tokyo lab hears the eerie pulsating and sussurating music, goes into his lab to investigate, and cries out in horror as he dies the same kind of death we have already seen....

This robbery follows a string of jewelry thefts she has committed on targeted victims. Penelope is trying to figure out why she is doing these things with the help of her long time and exasperated therapist, Dr. Gregory Mannix, who himself is in a mental quandary over his love for her and now what to do with this information of her crimes. Penelope is not remorseful, nor does she need or even use the money accrued from her crimes. She doesn't believe she's a kleptomaniac as her thefts are not a compulsion. And she even flaunts with the idea of others knowing that she committed these crimes, people such as Horatio Bixbee, the police lieutenant in charge of investigating the bank robbery, and even James himself. But when Penelope finally comes to the realization of why she is doing these things and what she should now do, the obvious may become too obvious. And James may come to his own realizations too late.

                    A businessman facially scarred in a laboratory fire receives psychotherapy from a psychiatrist, and obtains an amazingly lifelike mask from the doctor. Soon after being fitted for the mask, he seduces his wife and succeeds. But his wife claims she was aware all along who he was and believed that both were just masquerading together as most couples usually do in different ways. Strangely enough, his personality seemingly begins to change after he puts on the mask as if the mask has influenced his personality. His new identity does not enable him to reintegrate into society after all. A subplot is inserted in fragments. A good-natured young woman, the right side of whose face is disfigured, has been hurt by others' inquisitive eyes and insults, and has been shunned by men. She asks her older brother, the only man who understands her pain and solitude, to make love to her, hiding from him the intent of killing herself after then.

                    In Hong Kong, Eurasian exotic dancer Nicole Chang catches the attention of British high stakes cat burglar Harry Dean, who wants to use her in his latest scheme which also includes his partner, art expert Emile Fournier. The end goal is to steal the priceless statue of the Chinese Empress Li Soo from Ahmed Shahbandar, the richest man in the world who lives in the Middle Eastern country of Dammuz. Harry chose Nicole as his accomplice since she resembles Shahbandar's long deceased wife, who was the only love of his life, and Empress Li Soo herself. The plot involves Harry and Nicole traveling to Dammuz masquerading as Sir Harold and Lady Dean. There, news of Nicole being Shahbandar's wife and Li Soo's lookalike will make its way back to Shahbandar. He in turn will invite Harry and Nicole to his apartment, where Harry will scope out the situation to steal the statue. While Nicole keeps Shahbandar occupied for the evening, Harry will steal the statue. Nicole will excuse herself temporarily from Shahbandar's company, in reality making her way to the airport, where she will meet Harry who will give her her passport, plane ticket back to Hong Kong and her $5,000 US cut, the two never to see each other again. Harry will tell her only as much as she needs to know to carry out the plan. Harry's thoughts for the scheme don't come off quite as he anticipates, primarily because of Nicole and Shahbandar not reacting the way he anticipates. Nicole is difficult to convince, and she isn't the demure and refined Asian he had pictured, but rather a strong willed and chatterbox of a woman, who has a mind of her own and who says what she wants. And Shahbandar believes that Nicole looking exactly like his deceased wife, down to the hair and clothes, is just a little too coincidental for his comfort, he who has his eyes on the collective movements of ""Sir Harold and Lady Dean"" which he is certain are aliases. But these two wrongs may result in a right end goal for Harry. However, there is one other factor which Harry does not count on, namely what happens between him and Nicole.

During the eye examination, Sloane places drops in Ragheeb's eyes, blinding him in pain after a few seconds. After Ragheeb collapses and dies on the floor, Sloane takes off Ragheeb's glasses, and breaks them open to reveal a small piece of paper with crude drawings - seemingly hieroglyphics - on it.At Oxford, Professor David Pollock (Gregory Peck), an American, has taken over an absent Professor Ragheeb's class on ancient hieroglyphics. David makes a crude remark to wake up one of his sleeping students, Fanshaw (Gordon Griffin). At the end of the class, David is approached by Sloane, now referring to himself as Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane, a retired British military man now working as the private secretary for Middle Eastern shipping magnate, Nejim Beshraavi (Alan Badel), who would like to see him immediately on a lucrative business matter. David politely declines without knowing the specifics.David is out for a run when he is ambushed and forced into a Rolls-Royce limousine. He is taken aback by what just happened, until he notices that one of the men in the limo is Hassan Jena (Carl Duering), the Prime Minister of the Middle Eastern country where Beshraavi lives. David is in awe of Jena. The other man in the back of the limo is Mohammed Lufti (Harold Kasket), Jena's ambassador to Great Britain. Jena asks David to accept Beshraavi's offer so that he can find out what exactly Beshraavi's plans are specifically with some opposition to Jena's government policies. In doing this task, David is not to tell anyone he has met Jena, or that Jena is already in Great Britain. There is also some personal risk to David as Beshraavi is a dangerous man. Regardless, David accepts in his admiration for Jena.David meets with Beshraavi in a luxurious and expansive house in London, Beshraavi who has a menacing presence with a peregrine falcon with a penchant to kill if need be. Beshraavi asks David to decode a Hittite inscription - the piece of paper Sloane removed from Ragheeb's glasses - for a payment of $30,000. It should take David no more than a few hours, but Beshraavi gives David a veiled threat that he will be a prisoner at the house until the job is complete.In the library of the house, David is eating individually wrapped candies while he works on decoding the cipher. An exotically beautiful woman who David does not know, enters the room unannounced. She is Yasmin Azir (Sophia Loren), the owner of the house and Beshraavi's lover. Beshraavi, who later enters, infers that David can look but cannot touch with regard to Yasmin, with who he was immediately infatuated.There are four at the dinner table: Beshraavi, Yasmin, David and an English businessman named Beauchamp (Ernest Clark). As Yasmin accidentally knocks over a tray, she is able secretly to slip David a few pieces of paper. David accidentally reveals those papers, Beshraavi who wants to know what they are. David is able to conceal their contents, not wanting to get Yasmin into trouble. David immediately excuses himself, followed closely by Yasmin. Beauchamp and Beshraavi now alone together, Beauchamp remarks that Prime Minister Jena's signing of a business treaty with the British in two days will ruin Beshraavi's shipping business, Beshraavi who, in turn, says that the treaty will not be signed as told to him by a dependable soothsayer.Alone in a bathroom in the house, David reads the two pieces of paper slipped to him by Yasmin, one a news clipping about Professor Ragheeb's accidental death, the other a note from Yasmin asking him to meet her in her bedroom. As David meets Yasmin in her expansive ensuite and she turning on the shower just in case they could be overheard, Yasmin tells David that Beshraavi had Ragheeb killed, and will do the same to David once he decodes the cipher. Their conversation is interrupted as Beshraavi tries to get into the ensuite. As David hides in the shower stall with the water still running, Yasmin lets Beshraavi in. Yasmin and Beshraavi talk about issues such as David's work, and the cipher. Not to arouse Beshraavi's suspicions, Yasmin is forced to take her shower, exposing her naked self to David. Sloane then telephones Yasmin's bedroom phone, he telling Bashraavi that David and the cipher are missing. Overhearing that conversation from the ensuite, Yasmin confirms from David that he has the cipher in his possession. To hide it and without telling Yasmin, he wraps it in one of the candy wrappers he has been eating, a red wrapper with the number ""9"", which he places in his pocket among some other candy. As some in Beshraavi's employ go searching for David through the house, Beshraavi demonstrates to one of Yasmin's employees, Hemsley (Jimmy Gardner) that he can buy people for their loyalty or else exact extreme revenge. From that encounter, Hemsley tells Beshraavi that he saw David earlier come into this bedroom. Forced to show himself, David and Yasmin emerge from the ensuite, David seemingly abducting her at scissor-point. They escape together, with one of Beshraavi's henchmen, Mustapha (Larry Taylor), on their trail. That chase takes them to the Zoological Gardens, where among other things Mustapha shoots an aquarium, breaking the glass and killing the fish inside. Eventually, Mustapha and David get into a struggle, when a man from behind kills Mustapha. He identifies himself as Inspector Webster (Duncan Lamont) with CID, he who had placed Yasmin's house under surveillance. When a gardens guard approaches asking about who they are and who will pay for the damages, Webster kills him as he would not have been able to show him police identification. Because of this act, David surmises that Webster is not CID, and can't be working for either Beshraavi or Jena. It is then that Webster reveals that he is working with Yasmin.David awakens in the back of a moving panel van after being knocked unconscious by Webster back at the gardens. Webster and Yasmin are now with another man, who is in a loving embrace with Yasmin, he identifying himself as Yussef Kassim. All he wants to know is where the cipher is. David, seeing that they have emptied out his pockets of the candies with the cipher which are now on a shelf in the van, tells Yussef that Beshraavi has the cipher. They decide to use truth serum on David, after which, in a drugged stupor, he talks what they believe is gibberish about the number ""9"". Believing that he was telling the truth that Beshraavi has the cipher, Yussef tells Yasmin to work on Beshraavi to find out where it is, while they dump David out of the moving van in the middle of the highway. Still in a hallucinatory drugged state, David is almost killed several times over as he largely believes he's a bullfighter and the passing cars are bulls. Eventually, he stumbles across a bicycle and cycles away.The next morning, Yasmin arrives home to Beshraavi's loving embrace. They talk about why David took her hostage - she explaining that it was to escape from Beshraavi's threats to keep him a prisoner at the house until the job was complete - and both David and Mustapha having been killed at Yussef's hands. In the discussion, Yasmin implies that Beshraavi stole the cipher, which was intended for Yussef from Ragheeb, and that Yussef does not yet know the coded message. While Yasmin tells him that neither David or Yussef have the cipher, Beshraavi states that he doesn't have it. He also states that David is not dead, but was seen alive arriving back home on bicycle. Yasmin also tells him that Yussef kept her alive as he thinks she is working with him to get the cipher from Beshraavi. Believing David still has the cipher, Beshraavi sends Yasmin to get it from him as he believes her feminine methods would work better on David than Sloane's more violent ones.At David's apartment, he, still groggy from the drugs, is awoken by the telephone ringing. It is Jena, to who David tells that he doesn't know what's going on with Beshraavi yet, and that he does not have the cipher. Despite his near death encounters, David is reinspired after speaking to Jena. At the end of their conversation, Yasmin bursts into the apartment. Incredulous that she would show up after doing nothing while watching him almost get killed by her ""boyfriend"" Yussef, Yasmin is able to convince him that she hates Yussef and that the only reason she is in cahoots with him is that his boss, a general back home named Ali orchestrating a military takeover, has her mother and sisters hostage and will kill them if she doesn't cooperate. Likewise, she is only being friendly to Beshraavi on Yussef's orders. She is then able to convince him that what he needs to do is break the code of the cipher so that she can report that information back to the embassy, which will ensure both their safeties. It is then that both realize that neither has the cipher, and that it is still in the back of the van.David and Yasmin are at the construction site Yussef uses as his front. They spot the van. Before they can get to it, they see Yussef then Webster heading for the van. Before the two men leave, Webster, hungry, takes all the candy including the one in which David wrapped the cipher. Following Webster as he eats one candy after another, they pick up the discarded wrappers, to see if it is the red number 9 with the cipher. Some of the wrappers are more difficult to get to than others. They notice that Webster ate the red wrapped number 9 candy and spotted the cipher inside. He goes to a telephone booth to make a call, looking the number up in the telephone booth, meaning that the call is not to Yussef, whose number he already knows. Going to the booth after Webster has left, they see he has scribbled ""3:30"" underneath the listing for Beshraavi Shipping, meaning that Webster has joined forces with Beshraavi and will be meeting him at 3:30. Knowing Beshraavi's routine, Yasmin knows their meeting place.At Ascot, a decked out Yasmin is with Beshraavi, while a decked out David is looking for Webster. David and Yasmin are able to talk briefly to make plans to meet at 9 o'clock that evening at Trafalgar Square after David gets the cipher from Webster. David spots Webster rendezvousing with Sloane, to who he will hand over the cipher. David is able to poke the paper out of Webster's hand, the paper flying in the air and landing in the middle of the horse track with the horses in a race approaching. As David and Webster scuffle with each other, Sloane gets out a knife to stab David. He misses and instead stabs Webster dead. David risks his life by running out onto the track to retrieve the cipher. He is able to do so just before the horses gallop by, David running away with cipher in hand. This entire situation is visible not only to the entire crowd but more specifically Yasmin and Beshraavi.On a train, David is tracing a copy of the cipher, he who still has not been able to decode it. After he completes the copy, he places the original into a self-addressed stamped envelope which he posts immediately after getting off the train. There, he sees the headlines of the newspaper, which implicates him as Webster's murderer. He telephones Jena for help in this matter, Jena who can offer none except for the advice to stay clear of the police, which David does as he notices a bobby heading toward the telephone booth.Yasmin and Beshraavi are back at her house, he who has bought her several pairs of new shoes. As he helps her try on each pair caressing her legs in the process, they discuss what happened at Ascot. He believes this situation is perfect as she can get close to David, find out what decoded message is from him, and bring that information back to Beshraavi. Beshraavi threatens her in the process, implying that he will kill her if she doesn't succeed.David goes to Ragheeb's house, wanting to speak to his widow (Malya Nappi) as he figures that Ragheeb, who was murdered because of the cipher, may have told her what the decoded message is, or at least mentioned where he got it or have some notes somewhere among his possessions about it. He tells her of Ragheeb's death being murder by Beshraavi. Looking at the copy of the cipher, Ragheeb's widow tears it up in frustration, she finally at least implying that she knew that Ragheeb was working on something dangerous. David also tells her that he is working with Yasmin, her mother and sisters in danger at the hands of General Ali. On this news, Ragheeb's widow states that Yasmin is lying in that she has no mother or sisters, only a father who happens to be General Ali himself.At 9 o'clock that night at Trafalgar Square, David hops into Yasmin's just arrived car and they drive off. They are being tailed by one of Beshraavi's men, but Yasmin is able to lose him. Yasmin, grateful that David is still alive and not in jail, tells him of her discussion with Beshraavi. She asks directly if he still has the cipher. He responds that he no longer needs it as he has decoded the message as, ""The peg will not pass until the swans fly high in the kingdom of vesta"", he getting much of this made up idea from a billboard they just passed. He says he has done his job, he not needing to know what the message actually means. Rather than she dropping him off for his own safety while she goes to the embassy to report the information, he convinces her that it would be safer for him to stay with her, and that she can telephone the information to the embassy at a pay phone, which she does. She in turn convinces him that she does have to go to the embassy to deal with the aftermath, so he that he needs to find his own way from here as the police at the embassy would arrest him on sight. Following their arrangement to meet at the Knightsbridge Hotel where he is staying, he gets out of the car and she drives away, but he flags down a taxi to follow her. They follow her to Yussef's construction site, she obviously having telephoned him to arrange this meeting. However, hiding in the shadows, David can see Yasmin looking for Yussef in the building, and can see Yussef operating the wrecking ball, he who is planning to kill Yasmin with it. David rushes to save her, just before the wrecking ball comes crashing to where she was standing. Yussef, with wrecking ball, has the two of them on the run through the semi-demolished building, with one near miss after another. David eventually is able to maneuver himself to a spot where the wrecking ball hits an electrical power source, sending a major jolt of electricity through the wrecking ball machine to its cab, electrocuting Yussef to death.As David and Yasmin drive off, they argue, David mad at her for lying about going to the embassy and lying about her mother and sisters, he having got the truth from Ragheeb's widow. Yasmin then figures out why Yussef lured her to the construction site. She tells David that Ragheeb's widow is in cahoots with Yussef, Mrs. Ragheeb who lied to David about Yasmin's family and she who telephoned Yussef to tell him that Yasmin was double crossing him. Learning that Yasmin was telling the truth, David confesses that the story he told her of the decoded message was made up, and that he has not yet decoded it.At David's hotel room, David has worked through the night trying to decode the cipher, while Yasmin has been asleep in the bed. He wakes her up with a loving kiss when he has figured it out. It is not Hittite hieroglyphics as he initially believed it to be but rather a simple children's code. The decoded message is the nursery rhyme ""goosey goosey gander"", which is probably a red herring for something else. Remembering that Ragheeb's widow tore up a copy of the cipher upon seeing it, David finally realizes that it is not the drawings themselves, but rather something else on the original piece of paper which contains the message. Retrieving the original from the Hammersmith post office where he mailed it, David, in Yasmin's car while she is driving, tries several theories before he hits the jackpot: the cipher was written with dissolvable ink, which leaves the message remaining after dissolved. What remains is a microdot, when under a microscope reveals, ""Beshraavi plans assassinate Jena twelve thirty June eighteenth"", which is in twenty minutes time. They don't know where to go until Yasmin sees on a newscast that Jena has just landed at the airport. Facing road obstacles, David and Yasmin are able to make it to the airport a few minutes before 12:30. They, however, have problems trying to gain access to the press conference currently taking place. In the background, Jena, who has just been asked by a reporter about the business treaty he is about to sign with the British government, states that he will not be signing the treaty upon review of its contents. Fighting the police and the crowd, David is able to get to Jena and knock him to the ground, when bullets, from Sloane's machine gun, land where Jena was just standing. Jena is grateful to David for saving his life, David in turn telling him that the coded message stated that Beshraavi was going to kill him. Shocked, Jena asks to speak to David in private. Then, Lufti, as Jena is trying to make his way into a private room, shoots Jena dead. Yasmin whisks David off among the melee. She tries to convince him that the man who was just shot is not Jena. David is incredulous to this as he tells her that he knows Jena, has met him, and talked to him several times in the last few days. Yasmin, who now knows the entire picture of David's involvement, knows now that Beshraavi hired this man to impersonate Jena to David, without Beshraavi disclosing to the imposter that it would be a suicide mission. What tipped Yasmin to he not being Jena was that there was no recognition on his face of who she was, she who is a spy working for the real Jena.Making their way to a surveillance truck monitoring all of Jena's movement upon landing, Yasmin asks to see all the footage shot thus far. Reviewing that footage, Yasmin figures that the switch was made in the car transferring Jena from the plane to the terminal, as he was no longer wearing his trademark slippers after emerging from the window darkened car. Rushing off to where the car is located, they notice a large trunk being transferred from the car to a truck, they figuring Jena being inside the trunk. Yasmin figures Beshraavi needed the fake Jena to denounce the treaty before being killed in order to save his shipping business. Able to slip in the back of the truck as it takes off, David and Yasmin open the locked trunk to find the real Jena inside, bound and gagged but otherwise all right. The truck is headed to Yasmin's house and a waiting Beshraavi. The trunk removed from the truck, David, Yasmin and Jena are able to hide inside the truck while Beshraavi and his men transport the trunk to the house. Beshraavi, however, notices that the trunk's lock is broken. Suspicious, he orders the trunk to be opened right then and there, to find it devoid of Jena. By that time, David, Yasmin and Jena are able to run from the truck but are spotted off in the distance. A chase ensues, first through a low wheat field, where David, Yasmin and Jena are tracked by Beshraavi's men in various harvesting machines, one whose thrashing blades almost kill the three. Arriving at the stables, the three are able to secure some horses. At this time, Beshraavi and Sloane among others are following them in a helicopter with machine guns in hand. When the three arrive at a bridge, David figures they have better cover on foot among the bridge's structure. Beshraavi and Sloane are able to get some shots on the three as they race across the bridge, the helicopter making pass after pass underneath the bridge span. Getting to the mid span, the three are forced to stop due to construction work on the bridge. David, standing up to grab a construction site ladder, is an open target for Beshraavi and Sloane's next pass, they who end up missing David. As the helicopter makes its pass right underneath them on the bridge span, David drops the ladder into the helicopter's rotor. Disabled, the helicopter crashes below them into a burning blaze.David and Yasmin are in a romantic mood as they float leisurely in a canoe on a lake. Oblivious to what is going on around them as they kiss and embrace, they crash into a row boat. The male of the male/female couple in the row boat is angry at David, that is until he sees that it is Professor Pollock, the rower being his ""sleeping"" student, Fanshaw. To get the out of their crashed predicament, David uses a pole jabbed into the lake bottom to push off. He pushes too hard, leaving himself suspended on the pole away from the canoe. David tells Yasmin he can't swim as he falls into the water. Concerned, Yasmin jumps in to save him. ""Swimming"" David emerges from the water, he telling her that it was his turn to lie in what has been the major characteristic of their shared history. They embrace in the water.","

He invites Pollock to travel to London to meet the wealthy Nejim Beshraavi to translate a cipher in a hieroglyphic, but Pollock refuses the work. Soon Pollock is summoned by the Arabian Prime Minister Hassan Jena, who is unofficially in England and asks him to accept the assignment and spy the activities of Beshraavi that might be plotting something evil. Beshraavi offers 30,000 dollars to Pollock to work in his mansion deciphering the hieroglyphic. Pollock meets Beshraavi's mistress Yasmin Azir (Sophia Loren), who tells him that he is in danger and Beshraavi will kill him in the end of his work the same way he did with Professor Ragheeb.

                    Mild mannered American David Pollock, a professor of ancient hieroglyphics at Oxford, has been hired by Middle Eastern shipping magnate, Nejim Beshraavi, to decode a hieroglyphic written cipher, of which he has the original. What Beshraavi is unaware of is that David only took the job as a favor to Middle Eastern Prime Minister Hassan Jena, who David admires. David just met Jena for the first time on his clandestine visit to London prior to his official visit to sign a business treaty with the British government in two days' time. Jena tells him that what Beshraavi is asking him to do involves some plot orchestrated by Beshraavi, a countryman of Jena's, against his government. For Jena's security, David is not to disclose to anyone that he is doing this job for Jena, that he has even met Jena, or that Jena is already in London. This job also entails some personal risk to David's life as Beshraavi is not averse to killing to achieve whatever his goal. As David progresses on his task, he is approached by Yasmin Azir, the beautiful owner of the house where Beshraavi is staying and where David is doing the work, she who is Beshraavi's lover. She provides information which suggests that his task is more dangerous than it appears on the surface, as there are more players beyond Beshraavi interested in the cipher and its message, they who will also kill as needed to achieve their goal. However, David, who initially takes her information at face value, begins to have doubts if she is truly working in his best interest.

    Synopsis
    Professor Ragheeb (George Coulouris) is taken aback that his regular optometrist is not working, Sloane (John Merivale), a man who he has never met, taking his regular optometrist's place. During the eye examination, Sloane places drops in Ragheeb's eyes, blinding him in pain after a few seconds. After Ragheeb collapses and dies on the floor, Sloane takes off Ragheeb's glasses, and breaks them open to reveal a small piece of paper with crude drawings - seemingly hieroglyphics - on it.At Oxford, Professor David Pollock (Gregory Peck), an American, has taken over an absent Professor Ragheeb's class on ancient hieroglyphics. David makes a crude remark to wake up one of his sleeping students, Fanshaw (Gordon Griffin). At the end of the class, David is approached by Sloane, now referring to himself as Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane, a retired British military man now working as the private secretary for Middle Eastern shipping magnate, Nejim Beshraavi (Alan Badel), who would like to see him immediately on a lucrative business matter. David politely declines without knowing the specifics.David is out for a run when he is ambushed and forced into a Rolls-Royce limousine. He is taken aback by what just happened, until he notices that one of the men in the limo is Hassan Jena (Carl Duering), the Prime Minister of the Middle Eastern country where Beshraavi lives. David is in awe of Jena. The other man in the back of the limo is Mohammed Lufti (Harold Kasket), Jena's ambassador to Great Britain. Jena asks David to accept Beshraavi's offer so that he can find out what exactly Beshraavi's plans are specifically with some opposition to Jena's government policies. In doing this task, David is not to tell anyone he has met Jena, or that Jena is already in Great Britain. There is also some personal risk to David as Beshraavi is a dangerous man. Regardless, David accepts in his admiration for Jena.David meets with Beshraavi in a luxurious and expansive house in London, Beshraavi who has a menacing presence with a peregrine falcon with a penchant to kill if need be. Beshraavi asks David to decode a Hittite inscription - the piece of paper Sloane removed from Ragheeb's glasses - for a payment of $30,000. It should take David no more than a few hours, but Beshraavi gives David a veiled threat that he will be a prisoner at the house until the job is complete.In the library of the house, David is eating individually wrapped candies while he works on decoding the cipher. An exotically beautiful woman who David does not know, enters the room unannounced. She is Yasmin Azir (Sophia Loren), the owner of the house and Beshraavi's lover. Beshraavi, who later enters, infers that David can look but cannot touch with regard to Yasmin, with who he was immediately infatuated.There are four at the dinner table: Beshraavi, Yasmin, David and an English businessman named Beauchamp (Ernest Clark). As Yasmin accidentally knocks over a tray, she is able secretly to slip David a few pieces of paper. David accidentally reveals those papers, Beshraavi who wants to know what they are. David is able to conceal their contents, not wanting to get Yasmin into trouble. David immediately excuses himself, followed closely by Yasmin. Beauchamp and Beshraavi now alone together, Beauchamp remarks that Prime Minister Jena's signing of a business treaty with the British in two days will ruin Beshraavi's shipping business, Beshraavi who, in turn, says that the treaty will not be signed as told to him by a dependable soothsayer.Alone in a bathroom in the house, David reads the two pieces of paper slipped to him by Yasmin, one a news clipping about Professor Ragheeb's accidental death, the other a note from Yasmin asking him to meet her in her bedroom. As David meets Yasmin in her expansive ensuite and she turning on the shower just in case they could be overheard, Yasmin tells David that Beshraavi had Ragheeb killed, and will do the same to David once he decodes the cipher. Their conversation is interrupted as Beshraavi tries to get into the ensuite. As David hides in the shower stall with the water still running, Yasmin lets Beshraavi in. Yasmin and Beshraavi talk about issues such as David's work, and the cipher. Not to arouse Beshraavi's suspicions, Yasmin is forced to take her shower, exposing her naked self to David. Sloane then telephones Yasmin's bedroom phone, he telling Bashraavi that David and the cipher are missing. Overhearing that conversation from the ensuite, Yasmin confirms from David that he has the cipher in his possession. To hide it and without telling Yasmin, he wraps it in one of the candy wrappers he has been eating, a red wrapper with the number ""9"", which he places in his pocket among some other candy. As some in Beshraavi's employ go searching for David through the house, Beshraavi demonstrates to one of Yasmin's employees, Hemsley (Jimmy Gardner) that he can buy people for their loyalty or else exact extreme revenge. From that encounter, Hemsley tells Beshraavi that he saw David earlier come into this bedroom. Forced to show himself, David and Yasmin emerge from the ensuite, David seemingly abducting her at scissor-point. They escape together, with one of Beshraavi's henchmen, Mustapha (Larry Taylor), on their trail. That chase takes them to the Zoological Gardens, where among other things Mustapha shoots an aquarium, breaking the glass and killing the fish inside. Eventually, Mustapha and David get into a struggle, when a man from behind kills Mustapha. He identifies himself as Inspector Webster (Duncan Lamont) with CID, he who had placed Yasmin's house under surveillance. When a gardens guard approaches asking about who they are and who will pay for the damages, Webster kills him as he would not have been able to show him police identification. Because of this act, David surmises that Webster is not CID, and can't be working for either Beshraavi or Jena. It is then that Webster reveals that he is working with Yasmin.David awakens in the back of a moving panel van after being knocked unconscious by Webster back at the gardens. Webster and Yasmin are now with another man, who is in a loving embrace with Yasmin, he identifying himself as Yussef Kassim. All he wants to know is where the cipher is. David, seeing that they have emptied out his pockets of the candies with the cipher which are now on a shelf in the van, tells Yussef that Beshraavi has the cipher. They decide to use truth serum on David, after which, in a drugged stupor, he talks what they believe is gibberish about the number ""9"". Believing that he was telling the truth that Beshraavi has the cipher, Yussef tells Yasmin to work on Beshraavi to find out where it is, while they dump David out of the moving van in the middle of the highway. Still in a hallucinatory drugged state, David is almost killed several times over as he largely believes he's a bullfighter and the passing cars are bulls. Eventually, he stumbles across a bicycle and cycles away.The next morning, Yasmin arrives home to Beshraavi's loving embrace. They talk about why David took her hostage - she explaining that it was to escape from Beshraavi's threats to keep him a prisoner at the house until the job was complete - and both David and Mustapha having been killed at Yussef's hands. In the discussion, Yasmin implies that Beshraavi stole the cipher, which was intended for Yussef from Ragheeb, and that Yussef does not yet know the coded message. While Yasmin tells him that neither David or Yussef have the cipher, Beshraavi states that he doesn't have it. He also states that David is not dead, but was seen alive arriving back home on bicycle. Yasmin also tells him that Yussef kept her alive as he thinks she is working with him to get the cipher from Beshraavi. Believing David still has the cipher, Beshraavi sends Yasmin to get it from him as he believes her feminine methods would work better on David than Sloane's more violent ones.At David's apartment, he, still groggy from the drugs, is awoken by the telephone ringing. It is Jena, to who David tells that he doesn't know what's going on with Beshraavi yet, and that he does not have the cipher. Despite his near death encounters, David is reinspired after speaking to Jena. At the end of their conversation, Yasmin bursts into the apartment. Incredulous that she would show up after doing nothing while watching him almost get killed by her ""boyfriend"" Yussef, Yasmin is able to convince him that she hates Yussef and that the only reason she is in cahoots with him is that his boss, a general back home named Ali orchestrating a military takeover, has her mother and sisters hostage and will kill them if she doesn't cooperate. Likewise, she is only being friendly to Beshraavi on Yussef's orders. She is then able to convince him that what he needs to do is break the code of the cipher so that she can report that information back to the embassy, which will ensure both their safeties. It is then that both realize that neither has the cipher, and that it is still in the back of the van.David and Yasmin are at the construction site Yussef uses as his front. They spot the van. Before they can get to it, they see Yussef then Webster heading for the van. Before the two men leave, Webster, hungry, takes all the candy including the one in which David wrapped the cipher. Following Webster as he eats one candy after another, they pick up the discarded wrappers, to see if it is the red number 9 with the cipher. Some of the wrappers are more difficult to get to than others. They notice that Webster ate the red wrapped number 9 candy and spotted the cipher inside. He goes to a telephone booth to make a call, looking the number up in the telephone booth, meaning that the call is not to Yussef, whose number he already knows. Going to the booth after Webster has left, they see he has scribbled ""3:30"" underneath the listing for Beshraavi Shipping, meaning that Webster has joined forces with Beshraavi and will be meeting him at 3:30. Knowing Beshraavi's routine, Yasmin knows their meeting place.At Ascot, a decked out Yasmin is with Beshraavi, while a decked out David is looking for Webster. David and Yasmin are able to talk briefly to make plans to meet at 9 o'clock that evening at Trafalgar Square after David gets the cipher from Webster. David spots Webster rendezvousing with Sloane, to who he will hand over the cipher. David is able to poke the paper out of Webster's hand, the paper flying in the air and landing in the middle of the horse track with the horses in a race approaching. As David and Webster scuffle with each other, Sloane gets out a knife to stab David. He misses and instead stabs Webster dead. David risks his life by running out onto the track to retrieve the cipher. He is able to do so just before the horses gallop by, David running away with cipher in hand. This entire situation is visible not only to the entire crowd but more specifically Yasmin and Beshraavi.On a train, David is tracing a copy of the cipher, he who still has not been able to decode it. After he completes the copy, he places the original into a self-addressed stamped envelope which he posts immediately after getting off the train. There, he sees the headlines of the newspaper, which implicates him as Webster's murderer. He telephones Jena for help in this matter, Jena who can offer none except for the advice to stay clear of the police, which David does as he notices a bobby heading toward the telephone booth.Yasmin and Beshraavi are back at her house, he who has bought her several pairs of new shoes. As he helps her try on each pair caressing her legs in the process, they discuss what happened at Ascot. He believes this situation is perfect as she can get close to David, find out what decoded message is from him, and bring that information back to Beshraavi. Beshraavi threatens her in the process, implying that he will kill her if she doesn't succeed.David goes to Ragheeb's house, wanting to speak to his widow (Malya Nappi) as he figures that Ragheeb, who was murdered because of the cipher, may have told her what the decoded message is, or at least mentioned where he got it or have some notes somewhere among his possessions about it. He tells her of Ragheeb's death being murder by Beshraavi. Looking at the copy of the cipher, Ragheeb's widow tears it up in frustration, she finally at least implying that she knew that Ragheeb was working on something dangerous. David also tells her that he is working with Yasmin, her mother and sisters in danger at the hands of General Ali. On this news, Ragheeb's widow states that Yasmin is lying in that she has no mother or sisters, only a father who happens to be General Ali himself.At 9 o'clock that night at Trafalgar Square, David hops into Yasmin's just arrived car and they drive off. They are being tailed by one of Beshraavi's men, but Yasmin is able to lose him. Yasmin, grateful that David is still alive and not in jail, tells him of her discussion with Beshraavi. She asks directly if he still has the cipher. He responds that he no longer needs it as he has decoded the message as, ""The peg will not pass until the swans fly high in the kingdom of vesta"", he getting much of this made up idea from a billboard they just passed. He says he has done his job, he not needing to know what the message actually means. Rather than she dropping him off for his own safety while she goes to the embassy to report the information, he convinces her that it would be safer for him to stay with her, and that she can telephone the information to the embassy at a pay phone, which she does. She in turn convinces him that she does have to go to the embassy to deal with the aftermath, so he that he needs to find his own way from here as the police at the embassy would arrest him on sight. Following their arrangement to meet at the Knightsbridge Hotel where he is staying, he gets out of the car and she drives away, but he flags down a taxi to follow her. They follow her to Yussef's construction site, she obviously having telephoned him to arrange this meeting. However, hiding in the shadows, David can see Yasmin looking for Yussef in the building, and can see Yussef operating the wrecking ball, he who is planning to kill Yasmin with it. David rushes to save her, just before the wrecking ball comes crashing to where she was standing. Yussef, with wrecking ball, has the two of them on the run through the semi-demolished building, with one near miss after another. David eventually is able to maneuver himself to a spot where the wrecking ball hits an electrical power source, sending a major jolt of electricity through the wrecking ball machine to its cab, electrocuting Yussef to death.As David and Yasmin drive off, they argue, David mad at her for lying about going to the embassy and lying about her mother and sisters, he having got the truth from Ragheeb's widow. Yasmin then figures out why Yussef lured her to the construction site. She tells David that Ragheeb's widow is in cahoots with Yussef, Mrs. Ragheeb who lied to David about Yasmin's family and she who telephoned Yussef to tell him that Yasmin was double crossing him. Learning that Yasmin was telling the truth, David confesses that the story he told her of the decoded message was made up, and that he has not yet decoded it.At David's hotel room, David has worked through the night trying to decode the cipher, while Yasmin has been asleep in the bed. He wakes her up with a loving kiss when he has figured it out. It is not Hittite hieroglyphics as he initially believed it to be but rather a simple children's code. The decoded message is the nursery rhyme ""goosey goosey gander"", which is probably a red herring for something else. Remembering that Ragheeb's widow tore up a copy of the cipher upon seeing it, David finally realizes that it is not the drawings themselves, but rather something else on the original piece of paper which contains the message. Retrieving the original from the Hammersmith post office where he mailed it, David, in Yasmin's car while she is driving, tries several theories before he hits the jackpot: the cipher was written with dissolvable ink, which leaves the message remaining after dissolved. What remains is a microdot, when under a microscope reveals, ""Beshraavi plans assassinate Jena twelve thirty June eighteenth"", which is in twenty minutes time. They don't know where to go until Yasmin sees on a newscast that Jena has just landed at the airport. Facing road obstacles, David and Yasmin are able to make it to the airport a few minutes before 12:30. They, however, have problems trying to gain access to the press conference currently taking place. In the background, Jena, who has just been asked by a reporter about the business treaty he is about to sign with the British government, states that he will not be signing the treaty upon review of its contents. Fighting the police and the crowd, David is able to get to Jena and knock him to the ground, when bullets, from Sloane's machine gun, land where Jena was just standing. Jena is grateful to David for saving his life, David in turn telling him that the coded message stated that Beshraavi was going to kill him. Shocked, Jena asks to speak to David in private. Then, Lufti, as Jena is trying to make his way into a private room, shoots Jena dead. Yasmin whisks David off among the melee. She tries to convince him that the man who was just shot is not Jena. David is incredulous to this as he tells her that he knows Jena, has met him, and talked to him several times in the last few days. Yasmin, who now knows the entire picture of David's involvement, knows now that Beshraavi hired this man to impersonate Jena to David, without Beshraavi disclosing to the imposter that it would be a suicide mission. What tipped Yasmin to he not being Jena was that there was no recognition on his face of who she was, she who is a spy working for the real Jena.Making their way to a surveillance truck monitoring all of Jena's movement upon landing, Yasmin asks to see all the footage shot thus far. Reviewing that footage, Yasmin figures that the switch was made in the car transferring Jena from the plane to the terminal, as he was no longer wearing his trademark slippers after emerging from the window darkened car. Rushing off to where the car is located, they notice a large trunk being transferred from the car to a truck, they figuring Jena being inside the trunk. Yasmin figures Beshraavi needed the fake Jena to denounce the treaty before being killed in order to save his shipping business. Able to slip in the back of the truck as it takes off, David and Yasmin open the locked trunk to find the real Jena inside, bound and gagged but otherwise all right. The truck is headed to Yasmin's house and a waiting Beshraavi. The trunk removed from the truck, David, Yasmin and Jena are able to hide inside the truck while Beshraavi and his men transport the trunk to the house. Beshraavi, however, notices that the trunk's lock is broken. Suspicious, he orders the trunk to be opened right then and there, to find it devoid of Jena. By that time, David, Yasmin and Jena are able to run from the truck but are spotted off in the distance. A chase ensues, first through a low wheat field, where David, Yasmin and Jena are tracked by Beshraavi's men in various harvesting machines, one whose thrashing blades almost kill the three. Arriving at the stables, the three are able to secure some horses. At this time, Beshraavi and Sloane among others are following them in a helicopter with machine guns in hand. When the three arrive at a bridge, David figures they have better cover on foot among the bridge's structure. Beshraavi and Sloane are able to get some shots on the three as they race across the bridge, the helicopter making pass after pass underneath the bridge span. Getting to the mid span, the three are forced to stop due to construction work on the bridge. David, standing up to grab a construction site ladder, is an open target for Beshraavi and Sloane's next pass, they who end up missing David. As the helicopter makes its pass right underneath them on the bridge span, David drops the ladder into the helicopter's rotor. Disabled, the helicopter crashes below them into a burning blaze.David and Yasmin are in a romantic mood as they float leisurely in a canoe on a lake. Oblivious to what is going on around them as they kiss and embrace, they crash into a row boat. The male of the male/female couple in the row boat is angry at David, that is until he sees that it is Professor Pollock, the rower being his ""sleeping"" student, Fanshaw. To get the out of their crashed predicament, David uses a pole jabbed into the lake bottom to push off. He pushes too hard, leaving himself suspended on the pole away from the canoe. David tells Yasmin he can't swim as he falls into the water. Concerned, Yasmin jumps in to save him. ""Swimming"" David emerges from the water, he telling her that it was his turn to lie in what has been the major characteristic of their shared history. They embrace in the water.

                    This richly symbolic film is really impossible to understand without some knowledge of 20th Century Italian history, and particularly the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The Lateran Treaty of 1929 finally politically separated Italy from Church power by creating the Vatican as a sovereign state. But the trade off was the that the Church was still left in power over many aspects of everyday Italian life. For instance, Italy finally established a civilian divorce law through a bitterly contested 1970 referendum. Before then, divorce was under strictly in the domain of Church law, and the Church NEVER granted a divorce, even in extreme cases like when a spouse was abandoned many years hence. Overall, however, the power of the Church still resided in the blind allegiance of Italians at all levels to Church morality. Over decades, this led to impeding Italy's social and political progress, and greatly maintained the status quo in the division between the privileged upper class and the downtrodden masses. The Leftist and Communist movements that began after WWII battled against this status quo, and indirectly against the Church through Progressive agendas. ALL This doesn't even amount to an adequate thumbnail of all the issues that this film touched upon. Pasolini really needed to couch this head-on criticism of contemporary Italian society in a comedy, because I suspect that at some level he would have feared for his life had he delivered a more serious work covering the same controversial topics.
