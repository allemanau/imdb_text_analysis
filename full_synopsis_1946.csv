It opens with a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like ""Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy"". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. Angry at the neglected delivering Gower, drunk in the sorrow at the recent death of his son, beats George until the boy explains the situation. Upon testing the medicine and realizing the boy had averted a horrible mistake, Gower is profoundly remorseful and grateful to George, who vows to keep the error to himself. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S. Hinds), with a small staff including Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), run a small Building and Loan company that finances mortgages for the people of Bedford Falls. They face a difficult battle with the evil, avaricious, and wealthy Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Potter is on the board of directors of the Building and Loan, holds much of its assets, along with almost everything else in town, charges people exorbitant rent on his own apartments, and would like to put Bailey's company out of business.George wants to begin his adventures after going to college. While he has enormous respect for his father and what he is doing to help people, he definitely does not want to follow in his father's footsteps at the Building and Loan. But one thing after another thwarts his plans.George went to work at the Building and Loan for a few years after graduating from high school, with the expectation that Harry would take this over when he graduated, and George would go on a European tour and then go to college. But his father has a fatal stroke, and George has to take over the B&L for a few months, giving up the European tour. Then Potter attempts to liquidate the B&L, the only thing that can stop it is for George himself to take it over. So he gives up college, and gives his college money to Harry. The plan at that point was that, after Harry graduates, he will take over the B&L, and George will go to college. But Harry returns from college having married Ruth Dakin, and Ruth's father has offered him a job in upstate New York. Although Harry vows to turn it down for George's sake, George cannot bear to cost his brother the opportunity, so he has no choice but to stay with the B&L.George marries Mary Hatch after a difficult introduction--he mistakenly thinks Mary is in love with his lifelong rival Sam Wainwright (Frank Albertson). They are about to go on their honeymoon with $2000 they have saved up. But a banking crisis occurs. Potter has taken over the bank that guarantees the B&L's loans, and has called in the loans. The customers are in a panic and are tempted to go over to Potter's bank. The only way George can save the situation is to provide for the customers' needs out of his honeymoon money. Their friends Ernie (Frank Faylen) the cabbie and Bert (Ward Bond) the policeman arrange for them to have a cut-rate honeymoon at their house. They serenade the newlyweds from outside in the rain.The B&L continues to provide affordable housing for the people of Bedford Falls, creating a whole subdivision ""Bailey Park"". This includes the home of Mr. Martini (William Edmunds), the local tavernkeeper, and his family. Sam Wainwright and his wife come by to offer that George and Mary take a vacation with them in Florida, but they can't get away even for that.Potter is disturbed that George's B&L is taking customers away from his own apartment business, and attempts to bribe George into working for him instead, offering a huge salary and extensive travel. Tempting as that is, George is repelled by everything Potter stands for, and declines.So George stays with his wife and four children in Bedford Falls, never getting to leave. World War II comes and goes, and Harry serves (George is exempt because of his ear) and heroically saves an entire transport ship by shooting down two attacking airplanes. He is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor at a ceremony in Washington.On the morning before Christmas, the day that Bedford Falls will have a huge celebration for Harry, a bank examiner arrives to conduct a routine audit. The same day, Uncle Billy goes to the bank for a routine deposit of $8,000 in cash. Potter happens by, and Billy proudly points out the newspaper with the news about Harry. He accidentally folds the newspaper with the cash envelope in it, and Potter takes it back. Billy then realizes that he has lost the money. Potter, now in another room, sees this, and sneaks out.Billy arrives at the B&L, where George, generous as always, is giving Violet some of his own money for her to travel to New York City and start a new life. When Billy tells George about the loss, there is an uproar. George and Billy search everywhere that the money could possibly have been left. George shouts at Billy that this means bankruptcy, scandal and prison, and that he, George, isn't the one who will go to prison.George goes home in an incredibly foul mood, where his family are preparing for a Christmas party that evening. George is extremely bitter and nasty, and verbally abuses everyone, saying at one point ""Why do we have to have all these kids?"" The whole family are alarmed at his behavior. He learns that their youngest daughter ""Zuzu"" (Karolyn Grimes) is in bed with a cold. She apparently caught it walking home from school, having not buttoned her coat because she didn't want to harm a rose that she had been given. George goes up to see her. While handling the rose, some petals fall off. George puts them in his watch pocket.Zuzu's teacher, Mrs. Welch, phones to ask about Zuzu. George gives her a brutal tongue-lashing over her carelessness. When Mr. Welch gets on the line, George abuses and threatens him. Then George starts kicking and throwing things. The children are in tears. George storms out of the house. Mary phones Uncle Billy to find out what's wrong. The children ask whether they should pray for their father, and Mary says yes.While word spreads of the calamity, George goes to see Mr. Potter to beg for a loan of 8000 dollars. Mr. Potter is completely unsympathetic and sarcastic. He suggests that George has been cooking the books, playing the market with company money, or perhaps paying off a woman, pointing out that he is known to have been giving money to Violet Bick. Potter asks about collateral. All George has is a fifteen thousand dollar life insurance policy, but with only five hundred dollars equity. Mr. Potter says ""You're worth more dead than alive.""George goes to Mr. Martini's tavern and starts drinking, and then praying for divine guidance. His friends, including the kind and gentle bartender Nick (Sheldon Leonard), notice and try to help. Mr. Martini mentions George's name out loud, and Mr. Welch (Stanley Andrews), sitting nearby, hears it. He punches George, causing a bloody lip. George leaves, though his friends urge him to stay and rest. George drives his car toward a bridge. Because of the snowy weather, he accidentally drives it into a tree. The homeowner comes out and upbraids him for harming the tree. George just keeps walking, out onto the bridge, to kill himself.Just as George is about to jump into the frigid river and drown, Clarence comes down to Earth; his moment has come. He knows George well enough to know that if he, Clarence, jumps into the river, George will rescue him. He does so, and George jumps in and rescues him as predicted. They go to the toll-taker's shack to dry their clothes. Clarence explains all--that he is an angel, ""Clarence Odbody, Angel second class"", sent to save George from committing suicide. To George's astonishment, Clarence knows the whole story of his life. George is disbelieving and cynical about the whole thing, mentioning that it is not surprising that he got only a second-class angel, one without wings. He resists Clarence's entreaties, believing that he must have consumed tainted liquor. He finally says ""I wish I'd never been born."" Clarence formulates his plan, and, after a little prayerful communication with the senior angels, says ""You've got your wish. You've never been born.""Things change immediately. In the alternate universe it isn't snowing. George notices that he can hear through his left ear, and his lip isn't bleeding. Clarence points out that many things will be different now.As George and Clarence walk back toward town, they pass the tree that George had hit with his car. The car is gone, and there is no gash in the tree. The homeowner stops by, and George asks about the car and the damage to the tree. The homeowner knows nothing about this. He says ""You had me worried. One of the oldest trees in Pottersville."" George is confused, and tries to correct the man, but the man angrily tells George that the town is called Pottersville. George and Clarence walk off.They continue into town. Martini's tavern has become a sleazy dive, and Mr. Martini is nowhere to be found. It is now owned by the bartender Nick, but who is now very nasty and insulting. George and Clarence sit down at the bar. Clarence's polite speech and demeanor immediately displease Nick. George knows Nick, but Nick does not know George. When a cash register rings, Clarence points out that, whenever that happens, it means an angel has earned his wings. An elderly Mr. Gower, now a homeless derelict, comes in, and Nick tells him to leave. George speaks to Mr. Gower, but Mr. Gower doesn't recognize him. When George asks about the guy, Nick says that Mr. Gower spent 20 years in prison for poisoning some child, and that if this stranger knows Mr. Gower, he must be a convict also. Nick has George and Clarence thrown out of the tavern, and then derisively makes the cash register ring, saying that he is giving out angel wings.In front of the tavern, George is seriously disturbed by what is going on. Clarence explains once again that George doesn't exist. George checks his pockets for his wallet, other identification, or his life insurance policy. Clarence points out that they do not exist. Finally, George checks his watch pocket. Clarence says ""They're not there either."" ""What?"" ""Zuzu's petals. You've been given a great gift, George. The chance to see what the world would be like without you.""Continuing to be in denial of what is going on, George continues to walk downtown without Clarence. Bedford Falls has become Pottersville, and it is a dreary, brutish, and perverse place, full of bars and sleazy nightclubs. The movie theater, the Emporium department store, and the B&L, are long gone. Police are everywhere, dealing with disorders. George sees the police arrest Violet and take her away from a brothel. He hails Ernie's cab and asks to be taken home. Ernie has no idea who he is or where he lives. He gives Ernie the address, and Ernie tells him that that is an abandoned house, but he will take him there anyway. When George asks Ernie about his life, Ernie tells George that his wife left him three years ago, and that he now lives alone in a place called Potter's Field. He visually signals for Bert the policeman to follow them. As George searches the house calling out for his family, Clarence appears. Bert attempts to arrest them, but Clarence vanishes, allowing George to escape.George then goes to his mother's house, which has become a broken-down boarding house called ""Ma Bailey's Boarding House"". She opens the front door, but she does not recognize him and tells him to leave. George mentions Uncle Billy, and she says that he has been in an insane asylum since the B&L went out of business many years ago.Still in denial of what is happening, George then goes with Clarence to Martini's house in Bailey Park. There is no such place--it is a wasteland with a cemetery. Clarence points out the grave of Harry Bailey. Clarence says ""Your brother Harry Bailey broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.""""That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to war. He got the Congressional Medal of Honor. He saved the lives of every man on that transport."" says George.""Every man on that transport died. Harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save Harry. You see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?""George then asks to see Mary. Clarence says that she never married, and works at the library. George goes there. She doesn't recognize him. He tries to embrace her; she screams and runs into a nightclub. He runs after her, but is confronted by a crowd made of many he knows, but they of course have no recognition of this wild man they have never met before in this reality. Finally aware of what is happening, George calls out for Clarence as the police intervene. George slugs Bert and runs away. Bert shoots at him but misses, then pursues in his squad car.George runs to the bridge where he had been about to jump, and calls out ""Help me Clarence, please! Please! I want to live again!"" He piteously calls to God bring him back.With that plea, the alternate universe suddenly ends. It's snowing once again. Bert arrives in his police car, and calls out to George that he's been looking for him, since seeing his car plowed into the tree. He also points out that George's lip is bleeding. George is delighted to hear this, and to know that Bert knows him. He checks his watch pocket; the rose petals are there!George is ecstatic. He runs into town, which is once again Bedford Falls, and has all its familiar institutions, which he greets with unbounded joy. He even wishes Mr. Potter a Merry Christmas, who sarcastically wishes him a Happy New Year in jail considering the authorities are waiting for him at home. George arres home, knowing that he will likely be arrested for bank fraud. The officials are there, ready to arrest him. However, George stuns them by his delight at his arrest warrant, especially since his children are there also, and all have a joyful reunion.Mary comes home, along with many people led by Uncle Billy. Contrary to Mr. Potter's claim that they would hate him for losing their money, it turned out that when word got around that George was in financial trouble, the townspeople that he had been so generous to had contributed whatever they could provide. Dozens of people arrive, with a whole laundry basket full of money, jewelry, and other valuables. A telegram arrives from Sam Wainwright in Europe, saying that he had been contacted by Mr. Gower, and would advance up to $25,000 to cover the debt on the B&L. At this, the Bank Examiner, both moved by this show of public support and knowing that the financial deficit will be compensated, moves up to contribute and the attending police officer tears up the arrest warrant with a smile. Suddenly, Harry arrives from New York, having immediately left his award banquet upon hearing that his brother needed his support, and toasts ""To my big brother George. The richest man in town.""In the last scene, as the whole crowd sings ""Hark the Angels Sing"" and then ""Auld Lang Syn"" George finds a copy of the The Adventures of Tom Sawyer with a brief handwritten note on the inner pages. It reads, ""Dear George. Remember no man is a failure if he has friends. Thanks for the wings! Love, Clarence."" When Mary asks who Clarence is, George, well aware she would never believe the whole story, just says it is a Christmas present from a very dear friend. At that moment, a bell on the Christmas tree rings. Zuzu says ""Look, daddy. Teacher says, every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings."" George says ""That's right. That's right."" And, glancing heavenward, ""Attaboy, Clarence.""","
    
                    George Bailey has spent his entire life giving of himself to the people of Bedford Falls. He has always longed to travel but never had the opportunity in order to prevent rich skinflint Mr. Potter from taking over the entire town. All that prevents him from doing so is George's modest building and loan company, which was founded by his generous father. But on Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Billy loses the business's $8,000 while intending to deposit it in the bank. Potter finds the misplaced money and hides it from Billy. When the bank examiner discovers the shortage later that night, George realizes that he will be held responsible and sent to jail and the company will collapse, finally allowing Potter to take over the town. Thinking of his wife, their young children, and others he loves will be better off with him dead, he contemplates suicide. But the prayers of his loved ones result in a gentle angel named Clarence coming to earth to help George, with the promise of earning his wings. He shows George what things would have been like if he had never been born. In a nightmarish vision in which the Potter-controlled town is sunk in sex and sin, those George loves are either dead, ruined, or miserable. He realizes that he has touched many people in a positive way and that his life has truly been a wonderful one.

    Synopsis
    This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like ""Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy"". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. Angry at the neglected delivering Gower, drunk in the sorrow at the recent death of his son, beats George until the boy explains the situation. Upon testing the medicine and realizing the boy had averted a horrible mistake, Gower is profoundly remorseful and grateful to George, who vows to keep the error to himself. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S. Hinds), with a small staff including Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), run a small Building and Loan company that finances mortgages for the people of Bedford Falls. They face a difficult battle with the evil, avaricious, and wealthy Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Potter is on the board of directors of the Building and Loan, holds much of its assets, along with almost everything else in town, charges people exorbitant rent on his own apartments, and would like to put Bailey's company out of business.George wants to begin his adventures after going to college.

When George asks about the guy, Nick says that Mr. Gower spent 20 years in prison for poisoning some child, and that if this stranger knows Mr. Gower, he must be a convict also. Nick has George and Clarence thrown out of the tavern, and then derisively makes the cash register ring, saying that he is giving out angel wings.In front of the tavern, George is seriously disturbed by what is going on. Clarence explains once again that George doesn't exist. George checks his pockets for his wallet, other identification, or his life insurance policy. Clarence points out that they do not exist. Finally, George checks his watch pocket. Clarence says ""They're not there either."" ""What?"" ""Zuzu's petals. You've been given a great gift, George. The chance to see what the world would be like without you.""Continuing to be in denial of what is going on, George continues to walk downtown without Clarence. Bedford Falls has become Pottersville, and it is a dreary, brutish, and perverse place, full of bars and sleazy nightclubs. The movie theater, the Emporium department store, and the B&L, are long gone. Police are everywhere, dealing with disorders. George sees the police arrest Violet and take her away from a brothel. He hails Ernie's cab and asks to be taken home. Ernie has no idea who he is or where he lives. He gives Ernie the address, and Ernie tells him that that is an abandoned house, but he will take him there anyway. When George asks Ernie about his life, Ernie tells George that his wife left him three years ago, and that he now lives alone in a place called Potter's Field. He visually signals for Bert the policeman to follow them. As George searches the house calling out for his family, Clarence appears. Bert attempts to arrest them, but Clarence vanishes, allowing George to escape.George then goes to his mother's house, which has become a broken-down boarding house called ""Ma Bailey's Boarding House"". She opens the front door, but she does not recognize him and tells him to leave. George mentions Uncle Billy, and she says that he has been in an insane asylum since the B&L went out of business many years ago.Still in denial of what is happening, George then goes with Clarence to Martini's house in Bailey Park. There is no such place--it is a wasteland with a cemetery. Clarence points out the grave of Harry Bailey. Clarence says ""Your brother Harry Bailey broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.""""That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to war. He got the Congressional Medal of Honor. He saved the lives of every man on that transport."" says George.""Every man on that transport died. Harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save Harry. You see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?""George then asks to see Mary. Clarence says that she never married, and works at the library. George goes there. She doesn't recognize him. He tries to embrace her; she screams and runs into a nightclub. He runs after her, but is confronted by a crowd made of many he knows, but they of course have no recognition of this wild man they have never met before in this reality. Finally aware of what is happening, George calls out for Clarence as the police intervene. George slugs Bert and runs away. Bert shoots at him but misses, then pursues in his squad car.George runs to the bridge where he had been about to jump, and calls out ""Help me Clarence, please! Please! I want to live again!"" He piteously calls to God bring him back.With that plea, the alternate universe suddenly ends. It's snowing once again. Bert arrives in his police car, and calls out to George that he's been looking for him, since seeing his car plowed into the tree. He also points out that George's lip is bleeding. George is delighted to hear this, and to know that Bert knows him. He checks his watch pocket; the rose petals are there!George is ecstatic. He runs into town, which is once again Bedford Falls, and has all its familiar institutions, which he greets with unbounded joy. He even wishes Mr. Potter a Merry Christmas, who sarcastically wishes him a Happy New Year in jail considering the authorities are waiting for him at home. George arres home, knowing that he will likely be arrested for bank fraud. The officials are there, ready to arrest him. However, George stuns them by his delight at his arrest warrant, especially since his children are there also, and all have a joyful reunion.Mary comes home, along with many people led by Uncle Billy. Contrary to Mr. Potter's claim that they would hate him for losing their money, it turned out that when word got around that George was in financial trouble, the townspeople that he had been so generous to had contributed whatever they could provide. Dozens of people arrive, with a whole laundry basket full of money, jewelry, and other valuables. A telegram arrives from Sam Wainwright in Europe, saying that he had been contacted by Mr. Gower, and would advance up to $25,000 to cover the debt on the B&L. At this, the Bank Examiner, both moved by this show of public support and knowing that the financial deficit will be compensated, moves up to contribute and the attending police officer tears up the arrest warrant with a smile. Suddenly, Harry arrives from New York, having immediately left his award banquet upon hearing that his brother needed his support, and toasts ""To my big brother George. The richest man in town.""In the last scene, as the whole crowd sings ""Hark the Angels Sing"" and then ""Auld Lang Syn"" George finds a copy of the The Adventures of Tom Sawyer with a brief handwritten note on the inner pages. It reads, ""Dear George. Remember no man is a failure if he has friends. Thanks for the wings! Love, Clarence."" When Mary asks who Clarence is, George, well aware she would never believe the whole story, just says it is a Christmas present from a very dear friend. At that moment, a bell on the Christmas tree rings. Zuzu says ""Look, daddy. Teacher says, every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings."" George says ""That's right. That's right."" And, glancing heavenward, ""Attaboy, Clarence.""

Ballin surprisingly gets married to Gilda, a woman he only just met. The two have different reasons for getting married to each other. Ballin can see that Johnny and Gilda mutually hate each other, but he states that hate is an exciting emotion. As Johnny tries to carry out his work for Ballin, Gilda - who continues to do what she wants, married or not - is a constant distraction for him, which gets to the point where that strong emotion of hate starts to cross the line.

When Devlin flashes his official credentials, however, the officer allows Alicia to go without a ticket. Alicia, who has been hounded by reporters and police, is infuriated at Devlin and denounces him as a double-crossing ""cop.""Although Devlin disapproves of Alicia's self-destructive, promiscuous life style, he is confident of her patriotic feelings toward America, having heard secretly recorded comments she has made, and offers her a job infiltrating a Nazi industrial combine in Brazil.

While waiting for her assignment, Alicia enjoys a romantic, carefree week in Rio and proudly tells Devlin she is a changed woman. Devlin is skeptical about her reformation, but nonetheless finds himself falling in love with her.The couple's newfound bliss is short lived, however, as Devlin's boss, Paul Prescott, informs him that Alicia's assignment is to woo her former suitor, German-born Alexander Sebastian, and determine what his war machine combine is manufacturing. Although Alicia is conflicted, Devlin refuses to tell her what to do, and believing that he doesn't truly love her, she accepts the assignment. Devlin, in turn, views Alicia's acceptance as proof of her fickleness.

Alicia immediately inspects the layout of the house and learns from butler Joseph that only Alex has the key to the house's large wine cellar.Some days later, Devlin instructs Alicia to throw a party and secure the key long enough for him to investigate the wine cellar. Before the party, Alicia sneaks the wine cellar key off Alex's key ring and later passes it to Devlin. Alicia then slips away from Alex's watchful eye and accompanies Devlin to the cellar, where they discover that one of the bottles contains not wine, but a mineral substance. When Devlin accidentally drops the bottle, Alicia quickly drains a similar bottle and helps him pour the spilled contents into it. As they are leaving the cellar, Alex approaches with Joseph, and Devlin kisses Alicia to distract him. Although Alex falls for the ruse at first, he soon notices that his cellar key is missing.

    Synopsis
    At the end of World War II, Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), Al Stevenson (Fredric March) and Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) return home to Boone City. Fred was a decorated captain in the Army Air Forces in Europe, Al a sergeant in the Army who saw action in the Pacific, and Homer a sailor who served on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. Homer's ship was sunk, killing many of his fellow sailors; his arms were burned off below the elbow and he now uses metal hook prostheses. The three men share first a plane trip then a cab ride and become friends.Although he rose to the rank of captain, Fred was an unskilled soda jerk before the war, while the older Al was a bank executive. Homer was a star athlete engaged to be married to the girl next door, Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell). Aware of how uncomfortable his hooks make people, Homer begins to pull away from Wilma and his family. He feels comfortable only when he is with Al and Fred or hanging out with his Uncle Butch (Hoagy Carmichael), who owns a comfortable tavern. Fred is married to Marie (Virginia Mayo) but can't find her when he returns home, as she has begun to work nights at one of Boone City's night clubs.Al struggles to readjust to family life. His wife, Milly (Myrna Loy) and daughter, Peggy (Theresa Wright), do their best to make him comfortable, but he develops a drinking problem. On his first night home, he insists they go out drinking. At Butch's, they run into Fred and Homer, who has come there to get away from Wilma. Al and Fred get extremely drunk. When Fred passes out in front of Marie's apartment building, Peggy and Milly take him home with them. The next morning, Peggy drives Fred to Marie's building. On the way, they struggle with the fact they are attracted to one another.Al is promoted at the bank. He is now in charge of approving loans to servicemen under the GI Bill. He believes in taking risks on the servicemen even if they don't have any collaterol for loans. Although the director of the bank gently upbraids him in private, he applauds Al's slightly drunken public speech that providing the servicemen loans is tantamount to investing in the country's future. Al knows the bank will continue to question his loan approvals.Fred and Marie initially do well upon his return, when he still has money he earned in the Air Force. But when it runs out, he is forced to return to his job as a soda jerk. This angers Marie, who wants to be married to a dashing, successful, rich military man. Peggy visits Fred at the drug store, and they have lunch together. Afterwards, they kiss. That night, Peggy phones Marie and asks her and Fred out on a double date with a man she is uninterested in. Peggy despises the way Marie speaks of Fred and resolves to break up their marriage. When she tells this to Al and Milly, they tell her that all marriages struggle and that she should leave Fred and Marie alone. The next day, Al orders Fred to never see Peggy again. Fred calls Peggy to break things off, devestating her.Homer continues to isolate himself. Late one night, Wilma comes over and tells him that her parents want her to break off their engagement, though she doesn't want to. He takes her to his room to show her how difficult life will be with him: removing his prostheses, he shows her that he is unable to button his pajamas or even open a door. Tenderly, Wilma buttons his pajamas and tells him that she loves him and will never leave him. Homer finally accepts that people will accept him.Fred is fired from his job when he punches out a man who had told Homer that he and anyone else who died in the war were suckers who fought on the wrong side. Marie takes up with a successful serviceman and announces her intention of divorcing Fred. Disillusioned, Fred decides to leave town for good, leaving behind the medals and citations he won during the war. While waiting for an Army transport plane out of town, he reminisces inside a decommissioned bomber like the one he flew over Europe. When the foreman of the company dismantling the planes tells him the metal will be used to build new houses, Fred talks him into a job.Fred is best man at Homer's wedding to Wilma. He sees Fred for the first time since being ordered to leave Peggy alone. After the ceremony, Fred and Peggy embrace. He tells her that life with him will be hard as he doesn't have much money. She smiles and kisses him.

Johnny is excited about meeting Uncle Remus, a legendary black storyteller who amused John and Sally during their childhood, but is confused by his parents' anger toward each other. John, whose controversial writings have strained his marriage, returns to Atlanta alone, and Sally remains at the plantation with Johnny. Hurt by what he perceives as his father's desertion of him, Johnny sneaks out of the house with the intention of running away. As he walks along, Johnny finds the elderly Uncle Remus telling stories to a group of black children. Johnny stops to listen but runs off when Tempy and another servant, Chloe, come looking for him. Remus catches Johnny in the woods and agrees to run away to Atlanta with him, but insists on stopping at his cabin for provisions. While there, Remus tells Johnny a story of Brer Rabbit, who also tried to run away despite Remus' warning that there is no place far away enough to escape trouble: Brer Rabbit is captured by Brer Fox and Brer Bear, who intend to make a tasty meal of him, but the rabbit easily outwits them, escapes and returns to his briar patch. Strengthened by the story's moral, Johnny goes home with Toby, the young black servant assigned to look after him.

Ginny and Johnny become friends, and she gives him the puppy, Teenchie. Sally refuses to let him keep the puppy, however, and orders him to return it. Instead, Johnny takes Teenchie to Uncle Remus, who agrees to keep it for him, but the next day, the Favers boys threaten Johnny with violence unless he returns the puppy. Uncle Remus tells the distressed Johnny about the time Brer Fox and Brer Bear used a tar baby to trap Brer Rabbit, but were once again outwitted by Brer Rabbit, who begged them not to fling him into the briar patch. Johnny uses the lesson of reverse psychology to get the Favers boys to complain to their mother about the puppy, and Mrs. Favers gives them a sound whipping. The angry boys then tell Sally their story, and Sally accuses Uncle Remus of ""warping"" Johnny with his stories and orders him to stop telling them to her son.

                    Adélaïde, Belle, Félicie and Ludovic are young adult siblings who once lived in grandeur until their father's merchant ships were lost at sea. The family is now near ruin, but Adélaïde and Félicie nonetheless still squander away the family money on themselves and keeping beautiful, whereas Belle slaves around the house, doting on her father. Ludovic detests his two spoiled sisters, but is protective of Belle, especially with his friend Avenant, a handsome scoundrel who wants to marry Belle. Crossing the forest one dark and stormy evening, the father gets lost and takes refuge in a fantastical castle. Upon leaving, he steals a blossom off a rose bush, which Belle requested. The castle's resident, an angry beast, sentences him to one of two options for the theft of the rose: his own death, or that of one of his daughters. As she feels she is the cause of her father's predicament (despite her sisters asking for far more lavish gifts), Belle sacrifices herself to the beast. Upon arriving at the castle, Belle finds that the beast, whose grotesqueness she cannot deny, does not want to kill her, but wants to marry her and lavish her with riches. He does not force her, but he will ask her every night to marry him, these times the only ones when he will appear to her. She vows never to say yes. As Belle resigns herself to her mortal fate and looks deeper into the beast - whose grotesque exterior masks a kind but tortured soul - will her thoughts change? Meanwhile, Belle's family, who learn of her situation, have their own thoughts of what to do, some working toward what they believe is Belle's best welfare, and others working toward their own benefit.

                    Returning to England from a bombing run in May 1945, flyer Peter Carter's plane is damaged and his parachute ripped to shreds. He has his crew bail out safely, but figures it is curtains for himself. He gets on the radio, and talks to June, a young American woman working for the USAAF, and they are quite moved by each other's voices. Then he jumps, preferring this to burning up with his plane. He wakes up in the surf. It was his time to die, but there was a mixup in heaven. They couldn't find him in all that fog. By the time his ""Conductor"" catches up with him 20 hours later, Peter and June have met and fallen in love. This changes everything, and since it happened through no fault of his own, Peter figures that heaven owes him a second chance. Heaven agrees to a trial to decide his fate.

He's ordered his crew to bail out but knows he's not going to make it as he cannot land the plane and his parachute isn't functional. He makes contact with an Allied radio operator, June and she is amazed at his resilience in the face of death. Miraculously, he wakes up on the beach with a headache and not much else.

                    Pip, a good-natured, gullible young orphan, lives with kind blacksmith Joe Gargery and his bossy, abusive wife 'Mrs. Joe'. When the boy finds two hidden escaped galley convicts, he obeys under -probably unnecessary- threat of a horrible death to bring the criminals food he must steal at peril of more caning from the battle-ax. Just when Pip fears to get it really good while they have guests, a soldier comes for Joe who takes Pip along as assistant to work on the chains of escaped galley-convicts, who are soon caught. The better-natured one takes the blame for the stolen food. Later Pip is invited to became the playmate of Estelle, the equally arrogant adoptive daughter of gloomy, filthy rich Miss Havisham at her estate, who actually has 'permission' to break the kind kid's heart; being the only pretty girl he ever saw, she wins his heart forever, even after a mysterious benefactor pays through a lawyer for his education and a rich allowance, so he can become a snob in London, by now 'ashamed' of simple Joe. Only after years in idle wealth, Pip learns Havisham is not his benefactor as he assumed, and both her story and those of his real sponsor and Estelle...

She'll be taking it on the 7 PM train to Edinburgh. At Euston Station, Roland Carstairs (Geoffrey Steele) meets Holmes (Basil Rathbone), whom he has hired to guard his mother Lady Margaret (Mary Forbes), who has already boarded the train back home to Scotland. Actually, he's there to guard the Star of Rhodesia, which she has owned for many years, but was the object of an attempted theft when Lady Margaret wore it at a royal function. Holmes is certain the thieves will try again. Apparently, Scotland Yard agrees, as Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey) is also taking the trip. The train begins to pull out, and Watson (Nigel Bruce) and his old army friend Major Duncan-Bleek (Alan Mowbray) barely manage to board. They had bumped into each other, and forgotten the time as they reminisced. Carstairs brings Holmes to his compartment, where his mother is skeptical about the aid of a ""policeman"", but she lets Holmes examine the Star.While Holmes, Watson, Duncan-Bleek, and Lady Margaret are in the dining car, Carstairs falls onto the floor of his compartment. Lestrade hears the thud, but finds the door to the Carstairs compartment locked. Holmes arrives and has the attendant (Billy Bevan) open it. They find Carstairs dead and the box that had contained the Star empty. The body shows no wounds aside from a tiny spot of blood, but Holmes declares it's murder, since a thief arriving right after Carstairs died of natural causes is too improbable. Watson, unimpressed with Lestrade's plodding, decides to try questioning suspects himself. (Thus suspects are those who occupy compartments in the same car, as the attendant was at the door to the leading car, and the trailing car is the locked luggage van.) Watson gets nowhere at all in his attempt with cranky William Kilbane (Frederick Worlock), a professor of mathematics. However, when he questions Alfred Shallcross (Gerald Hamer), he gets an immediate confession. Watson summons Holmes and Lestrade, only to learn that Alfred was confessing to having stolen a teapot from the hotel where he stayed in London. Lestrade is not amused, but neither he nor Holmes can get any more cooperation from Prof. Kilbane than Watson did. Later, Holmes tells Lestrade that this puts him in mind of Colonel Sebastian Moran, master jewel thief and amateur mathematician.Holmes is nearly pushed off the train by an unseen assailant, but he manages to hang on to the outside and eventually climb back aboard. He and Watson enter the luggage van and convince the guard there to let them examine the coffin. It has the remains of an elderly woman in the top part, but also a false bottom that could have hidden the murderer. The two of them, plus Lestrade and Duncan-Bleek pay a call on Vivian, who admits that she was hired to take the coffin to Edinburgh. She knew about the compartment in the coffin, but was being paid. Holmes asks if her employer was Duncan-Bleek, but she says she never saw him before. Watson is shocked that Holmes would subject his old friend to that kind of suspicion. Later, Holmes reveals that he's had the real Star all along, and Lestrade takes it. Back in the luggage van, Holmes and Watson discover that the guard has been murdered. He also has a tiny spot of blood, but this time they find the tiny gelatin dart that delivered poison. Unlike the case of Carstairs, there hadn't been enough time for it to dissolve in the wound.Holmes's assailant, a man named Sands (Skelton Knaggs) renders the attendant unconscious so he can visit Duncan-Bleek unobserved. He reports how he dealt with the guard and the attendant, and turns the diamond he stole over to the Major, who knows it's the fake planted by Holmes. He has Sands club Lestrade and grab the real gem, then kills Sands with his poison-dart airgun. He leaves, and Holmes and Watson arrive to revive Lestrade. The train stops just across the Scottish border, where an Inspector MacDonald (Boyd Davis) and his men board. MacDonald, claiming jurisdiction because he's from the Edinburgh police, has them all move to the dining room to conduct his investigation.Holmes tells MacDonald that Duncan-Bleek is Moran, but the latter pulls the emergency brake cord, and a fight in darkness ensues. It ends with Holmes triumphant, and the vanquished tangled up in his coat. MacDonald takes the prisoner off the train, which starts off for Edinburgh. Holmes points out to Watson that Moran lies unconscious on the floor. As he revives, he's startled not to find himself in the company of MacDonald, who was actually his accomplice. However, Holmes realized that (mainly because he knew the real MacDonald), and the man the fake police took off the train was Lestrade. Meanwhile, Lestrade has untangled himself, pulled a gun on his supposed captors, and arrested them. Moran wants to take solace in the fact that Holmes doesn't have the Star, but of course the detective has pulled yet another switch, and reveals the real diamond.","
    
                    Holmes is hired by Roland Carstairs to prevent the theft of the Star of Rhodesia, an enormous diamond owned by Carstairs' mother, Lady Margaret. Believing the diamond will be stolen on a train trip from London to Edinburgh, Holmes deftly switches diamonds with Lady Margaret while in her compartment. Soon after, Roland is murdered and the fake diamond is stolen. Red herrings abound as Holmes, aided by Dr. Watson and Inspector Lestrade, discover the murderer's hiding place and deduce that long-time foe Moriarty's henchman Colonel Sebastian Moran is somehow involved in the crime.

Then he visits Ruth in her apartment and discovers that she has an identical twin sister called Terry. Lt. Stevenson does not know who the killer is and the prosecutor does not accept to open the case. The sisters can not find a job and Dr. Scott Elliott, who is a specialist in twins that had been contacted by Lt. Steenson and has a crush on Ruth, offers a reasonable allowance to the sisters to be submitted to a series of tests for his research of personalities of twins. Scott finds through the results that Terry is a psychotic woman and Ruth might be in danger.

Stephenson investigates the murder of a doctor, who was found stabbed in his apartment, he learns that he had dinner with a woman named Teresa Collins the evening of his death.

It turns out not to be so easy when he learns she has a twin sister, Ruth and neither will implicate the other as being the woman who was there. A psychologist who has made a study of identical twins, Dr. Scott Elliott, agrees to look into the case and concludes that one of them is insane. Complicating matters is the fact that he is falling in love with one of them.

The film's attempted biography matches many public myths surrounding Cole at the time, despite its lack of relationship with truth. For instance, truth and movie are different in regards to: his sex life (he was a gay man in a marriage of convenience with a divorcee friend), his relationship with his wife, Monty Wooley was a contemporary (not Professor), and his French military experience was a hoax.

                    Paul Boray comes from a working class background. He has been interested in the violin since he was a child, which his father disliked since he felt it a waste of money, but which his mother supported. Into his adult life, Paul wants to become a concert violinist, and although he shows talent, he does not have the right connections to make it into the concert performance world, much like his longtime friend, virtuoso pianist Sid Jeffers, and cellist Gina, both who, like Paul, train with the National Institute Orchestra. Gina and Paul have a connection with each other, Gina who confesses her love for him. While performing at a party with Sid, Paul meets Helen and Victor Wright, their hosts. Victor is a perceptive but self-admittedly weak man, while his wife Helen is strong minded but insecure which manifests itself as neurosis. She constantly tries to forget about her unhappy life by excessive alcohol consumption. Helen becomes Paul's benefactress, which ultimately results in a successful concert career for Paul. But the two also fall in love, a destructive love against the wishes of Paul's mother and Gina. That love may not only destroy Paul's concert career, but their lives as well.

He tells her the King's palace is known as the Universe, a single Sun with a thousand moons - the sun being the King and the moons being his many women, including a harem. Chow Koon (Lee J. Cobb), the Prime Minister, arrives at the dock to meet her and through his translator, asks her about her late husband and what he did. She tells him his only concern should be with her capacity as governess. His translator tells her she will be taken to the palace. She argues that she was promised a house of her own upon her arrival. He responds if she won't go to the palace, she can go wherever she pleases. Then they simply leave. Anna is offended and says he was rude, but the Captain explains that in Siam they ask personal questions to be polite. And the fact that he came to meet her in person was a sign of respect - women ""do not exist"" in this country. He suggests she tells him she didn't understand and apologize to him in the morning.She stays the night on the boat and arrives on foot at the palace the next morning, politely asking to see the Minister. She apologizes for her behavior the night before. He asks through the translator if she is really sorry or just being polite to ask for a favor. She admits it's both - she needs his help to get started in her job. Her son Louis comments that he's not wearing a coat and that he's afraid of him. Chow Koon laughs and begins talking to them in English. He admits he likes the boy and acts more friendly. He asks why she cannot live in the palace instead of having her own house. She replies that she needs time alone with her son after her duties are done. Chow believes that the King promised her a house, but says the King does not always remember his promises, and that if he reminds him it might make His Majesty angry. Anna says she will be glad to tell the King about it herself. The Minister tells her the King's busy schedule and that she might have to wait for days to see him. He will arrange the meeting, and comments it should be very interesting.She begins to unpack in the palace and her female servant is concerned that she was told her husband Moonshe cannot stay with her. When Anna tries to leave for dinner, there are female guards blocking the door. She discovers she is being housed in the harem of the palace.A month or so passes and the day of her meeting with the King finally arrives. Chow Koon has her shown the method of greeting the King - descending on the floor and then crawling on her hands and knees. Anna refuses and shows him how she and her son will bow. He tells her she can do what she wishes, but remember she is not the only one with a temper. After waiting for a time she is brought in, only to be told the King will not have time to see her. She refuses to wait and barges up to him along with Louis. ""Who, Who, Who?"" asks the irritated King (Rex Harrison) upon seeing her. She is announced as the governess. He says she does not look like a scientific person to teach a school and asks her how old she is, so she responds 150. He tries to challenge her on that comment with other questions like when she was born and how long she's been married. Finally he stumps her by asking how many grandchildren she has, which she cannot think up a quick answer to. ""I make better questions that you make answers"", he laughs, almost like an amused child. He asks if she is not afraid to tell him something is not his business. She says it would not be a compliment to His Majesty to be afraid of him. Not being afraid is good in a scientific mind, he agrees. He is pleased and brings her into another chamber to meet his wives and children - he has several wives and 67 children in all. He tells her to begin teaching his children and any of his wives who have sense to learn on the next Thursday. Then he asks Chow Koon why she was not presented to him sooner!The next day as she prepares for school, the king arrives upset. He complains that the newspaper called him a spare man, but he insists he is very necessary. She explains that spare has two meanings - one is thin. Instead of being relieved, he is upset that a woman has corrected him. ""How can King be wrong and woman be right?"" he chides. He decides to cancel the class, so she instead asks about the house he promised her. He tells her she is just a slave and it is his pleasure that she resides in the palace. She storms off, even as he angrily tells her to come back. She packs to leave, only to have one of the King's men arrive and tell her that the King has decided to give her a house. But the place she is taken to is little more than a run-down shack. She refuses it, but she decides to stay in Siam anyway, insisting he will give her a real house before she leaves if she has to stay there the rest of her life!She starts teaching the children the next day with the help of Lady Thiang (Gale Sondergaard), a woman who learned English from missionaries. A month passes, and as the king examines his daily assortment of gifts, one of them turns out to be a beautiful young woman named Tuptim, (Linda Darnell) a gift from the governor of Lao Province. He also finds a model of a house marked ""Made in England"" with the inscription ""A man's house is only less dear to him than his honor."" He also finds that his children are learning sayings like ""A promise deferred is justice delayed"", and Miss Owens is teaching them to sing, ""There's no place like home.""Later, his Prime Minister tells him they have lost Cambodia. France has made a treaty with the country and declared it independent of Siam and under their protection. The King realizes that outside forces are trying to break up his country, but he does not wish to fight; he wants to hold the country together and keep what is left safe. Chow Koon laments that he never should have asked his friend to leave the monastery he was living in and become King. He wonders what they should do. When the King hears ""Home, Sweet Home"" being played again he tell his minister thats a sign to never give up on anything. He orders Chow Koon to find Anna a house.The house the governess is given now is much nicer and she is pleased with it. But she tells Chow Koon that now that she has been given the house she was promised, she is leaving. She won't stay in a country where promises mean nothing. She tries to leave for the boat, but Chow has her dragged away to his house. But there he asks her politely to stay. He tells her the King is two men - one a king, one a man trying to modernize his country quickly and being rejected by some of his people as he does so. The conflict between the two makes it hard to know how to act. He says someone like her is needed because she can speak to the King both as a woman and someone he respects, and he will listen to her because she is not trying to gain his favor. Anna is touched by his concern and agrees to stay.At a class later on, Tuptim arrives with a monkey on her shoulder. Anna insists that she take the monkey away, threatening to report her to the king. She takes the monkey outside, but challenges her to report her anyway. Lady Thiang warns Anna that Tuptim is the King's new favorite now. The teacher later finds out that Lady Thiang is the mother of one of her best students - the King's eldest son Prince Chulalongkorn. When she goes to find Louis, she discovers he is having a disagreement with the prince, who heard him apologize to his mother and thought this was unmanly. Anna explains that she is like a father to Louis, and thus he does not resent being corrected by her just as the prince accepts criticism from his own father. The prince admits he is glad it is not like that is his country, but he respects Louis once again.One night, Anna is summoned by the King in the middle of the night. But he only called her to complain that he thinks Moses is a fool, because he said the world was created in only six days. While walking back to her house, she hears a baby crying and sees Lady Tuptim's slave chained to a post with her baby in her arms. Anna speaks to Tuptim the next day on the slaves behalf, explaining that the woman tried to buy her freedom and she does not understand why she refused to let her go - even though the law of Siam says she must. Tuptim is unhappy about her own situation so she does not see why her slave her slave should be allowed to be happy. Anna goes to the king to talk about it, but he has already heard about it from Tuptim and doesn't wish to be bothered. She explains that no one, even the King, is above the law - it must apply to all people, even if they are the King's favorite. Otherwise the word of the King would mean nothing and could be overturned by his successor. They talk about Queen Victoria and President Lincoln, but he will not comment any further on Tuptim's slave. However, the next morning, Tuptim shows Anna a gift the king gave her in exchange for freeing the slave. But when Anna lets it slip that she talked to the king, Tuptim realizes he gave her the gift at the teacher's suggestion. She feels she is no longer the King's favorite and angrily smashes the gift.Again Anna is summoned by the King, this time while eating lunch. Sir Edward Ramsey is coming to visit and His Majesty wants the Englishwoman to prepare his prettiest women for presentation in the European fashion, in order to have Ramsey report back to Queen Victoria that he is not a barbarian as other visitors to England have claimed that he is. She suggests that he set up consulates in his country so that other country can see for real what the Siamese are like, instead of hearing stories from sea captains and such. He rejects the idea, but then later summons her with the same suggestion, except he adds that they should all meet over dinner first. The dinner is held the following Saturday. The people are impressed with the King's knowledge of America and Abraham Lincoln. He tells them Siam is aware of what is happening all over the globe. Afterward, he has Anna summoned late that night. He is eating now and tells her he was too nervous and afraid to eat at the dinner, but feels fine now that everything has gone well. He gives her a gift as a reward, and shares his meal with her.At class the next day, no one is there. Curious, Anna asks Lady Thiang what is happening. Lady Thiang tells her that Lady Tuptim had escaped from the palace but has been recaptured fleeing from a monastery along with a young man. She says her trial is already taking place, and Anna goes to help her. At the trial (which is more of an inquest), Tuptim tries to explain that the young monk is indeed a young man she was once betrothed to her as a young girl, but that he did not know who she was and she had remained dressed like a man at all times. She had just wanted to be near him again. They insist instead that he knew who she was and that she made him break his priestly vows. She insists her story is true and they begin to flog her. Anna makes them stop and insists she will get the King to release her.She goes to the King but he does not care what happens to Tuptim anymore, since she offended him by running away. She begs him not to take revenge against this girl. She says if he does so, he will prove that all his improvements meant nothing. When he will not relent, she tells him that he is a barbarian. He tells her how would she like it if he made her watch what he does to Tuptim. Anna runs off, fearful of the King for the very first time. A short time later, Tuptim and the young man are burned at the stake together. She dies screaming that he had not sinned and neither had she.Soon after, Anna prepares to leave and says her good-byes to all the children. But the king's wives, whom she also taught, read a letter they wrote begging her to stay. She goes to see Lady Thiang, asking why she had been avoiding her. The Lady points to her wallpaper showing several pictures depicting her own life. First there are two trees representing her and the king, as she was his first wife. Then other pictures show other trees coming between them - his other wives. The king tree grows tall to reach the sky, but loses all its leaves and casts no comforting shadow. Her tree ends up drooping and small; she is unable to help him. Finally a smaller tree grows beside her that she tries in vain to protect from the harsh sun; this represents her son. She says she knows now that her son will become the same as the King, vain and arrogant, rather than a kinder, gentler person as Anna could have taught him to be. Lady Thiang will now remember Anna's failure every time she looks at her son.Shortly afterward, Louis Owens is out riding when his horse stumbles causing the boy to fall and be killed. Anna is devastated. The King sends his consolations to Anna via the Prime Minister, writing that September the 12th will be declared a national day of mourning for her son, and that Anna is to be appointed as Lady Kroo Yai. Chow Koon explains that the letter is an apology not only about her son, but about Tuptim as well. This is the first time he has ever tried to say he is sorry. She tells Chow to please thank the king for her. Prince Chulalongkorn comes to see her and shows her the jackknife Louis gave to him as a parting gift. He offers to return it, but she tells him he can keep it. He says he did not give Louis anything but wishes to give her a gift in his place - a white elephant. He says it is strong and will look after her. She says if he gives her the elephant, who will look after him? ""You really need someone to look after you,"" she says tearfully. They hug, and she realizes she cannot leave him.The King again summons Anna, concerned that she is not taking her medicine. She thanks him for all he has done since her son's death. He asks if she will help him with important correspondence that he has no time to read. She says tearfully that shed like to just stay on with her school. It's the children she wants to help. He agrees.She returns to teach school and stays afterward to answer any questions. One of the King's men comes by saying the King is begging for her help with his correspondence. She goes to see him and sees how frustrated he is, so she agrees to help him as well. Years pass, where consulates are set up for other countries and the Prince becomes a full-grown man with Anna there helping through it all. One day the king's man, now very old himself, summons her very despondently. The Prime Minister tells her that the King is very ill, likely dying. She goes into the library, where he is collapsed on a small bed. He has a letter to read to her, but then tells her in his own words instead. He is glad that she always told him the truth even when he didn't want to hear it. She has helped raised his children to be better men than he was, and he is grateful. He doesn't want to die without telling her of his gratitude, great respect, and confidence in her that grew larger every day. Then he dies peacefully.""He tried so hard,"" she admits, ""but he was afraid to ask for help."" She wonders what she will do now. The Prime Minister suggests that she should stay and help the Prince. She stays on. The Prince is crowned the new King. His first message is that the ancient national custom of people being on their knees before the King is abolished and that all should stand in front of the king instead as men should do. His subjects all rise up gratefully, as he promises this will be the first of many positive changes to help unite his country. Lady Thiang looks at Anna with gratitude, as does the new King.","

                    Rich, disabled, iron-willed Francis Ingram lives in a musty, turn-of-the century Renaissace Italian mansion, where, despite having only one hand, he maintains his virtuoso skills on the piano. The wheelchair-bound Ingram has a strong belief in the occult and uses the neurotic Hilary Cummins to maintain his massive library of books on spiritualism and the supernatural. Ingram displays a luridly possessive interest in another assistant, his beautiful nurse Julie Holden, who tries to break away from her employer's obsessive control. She finds herself attracted to Bruce Conrad, a charming local musician who cons wealthy tourists. He maintains an amicable relationship with Ingram but recommends Julie leave her manipulative employer. When Ingram is murdered after writing his last will and testament, greedy relatives swarm to the estate and the list of possible suspect grows.

As he finds there is rather more to it, he is increasingly glad to have his attractive new secretary Kathleen around, for several reason.

When he invites Kathleen to date and have dinner with him, they see a man wearing a white suit in their tail. Brad holds the man that tells that he is also a private investigator called Fred Foss and hired by Jardine to follow him. When a car almost hit Brad on the street, he visits and argues with Jardine, who is also a seducer of married women, and they fight. Later, when Jardine is murdered in his apartment, Brad realizes that he was framed. His only lead is the man of white suit, and with the support of Kathleen, they try to find the unknown man to discover who is behind the murder of Jardine.

Brad learns directly from the white suited figure that the person who hired him to follow Brad is Tony Jardine, Brad's old business partner from San Francisco. Tony, too, has relocated to New York City, and works for and is a social acquaintance of Hardy Cathcart, a wealthy art gallery owner and art collector. Brad and Tony's business partnership ended because Tony was blackmailing clients, and other actions on Tony's part resulted in Brad being charged with vehicular manslaughter. Brad has no idea why Tony has had him followed, but he believes that Tony wants him dead. But as Brad tries to figure out exactly what Tony wants, Brad becomes implicated in a murder. Following the murder, he begins to realize that there was something not quite right about how he found out that the man in the white suit was following him. The tables are turned when Brad tries to find the man in the white suit to uncover what's going on. Through this entire ordeal, Kathleen Stewart, Brad's secretary, is by his side, the two who have a mutual attraction to each other. Despite words from Brad for her to leave to protect herself, Kathleen stands steadfastly by her man.

Martin and Catherine concoct a scheme to get a job performing at Rios, the club Marko owns in hopes of getting more information on Marko that may lead to showing that Catherines husband is innocent. They begin finding clues of Markos relationship with Marvis, many of which are secured in a safe in the night club.

                    Both living in New York City, successful artist Phillip Gayley, most renowned for his series of Gayley Girls (swimsuit models in evocative poses), and Ellen Gayley, a one time Gayley Girl, have been divorced for one year. They each have six month custody of their only child, now seven year old Phillippa Gayley, nicknamed Flip. Flip loves both her parents and misses the other when she's not with that parent for that six months, especially when they have to say goodbye at the end of the six months. Phil didn't want to get the divorce, and Ellen only went through with it, convinced by her judgmental mother, Mrs. Hamilton, that Phil had a constantly wandering eye, most specifically with whoever the Gayley Girl of the day. Mrs. Hamilton would rather see Ellen married to someone more stable and secure, like her stuffy and officious lawyer, Rex DeVallon. However, both Phil and Ellen still love each other, and without telling the other would deep in their hearts want to reconcile. Beyond Flip, another person who does whatever he can to get them back together is their mutual friend Luigi, in whose restaurant they met, fell in love and got engaged. However as Gayley Girls still exist - the current, Nancy Graham, who sees herself as the future Mrs Gayley - as Rex is still in Ellen and Mrs. Hamilton's lives, as Mrs. Hamilton still dislikes Phil for what she believes he did to her daughter, and as Luigi's actions generally backfire, a road to a happy ending for Phil, Ellen and Flip may have a few bumps along the way. An added complication is the entrance of Flip's pen pal, US Marine Corporal Fenwick Lonkowski, who is in New York on his first leave in eighteen months.

The pair have been saving to buy a horse of their own to ride. The boys meet Attilio, Giuse's much older brother, and his shady friend at a boat on the Tiber. In return for a commission, the boys agree to deliver black market goods to a fortune-teller. Once the woman has paid, Attilio's gang suddenly arrives, pretending to be cops, to shake the woman down. With a payoff from Attilio, the boys are able to make the final payment and stable their horse in Trastevere over the river. The fortune-teller identifies Pasqua and Giuse. Held at an overcrowded boys' prison, they are separated. Giuse falls under the influence of an older lad in his cell, Arcangeli. During interrogation, Pasqua is tricked into betraying Giuse's brother to the police. With their trial still in the future, the two friends are driven further apart.

The next day Pasquale and Giuseppe are arrested by real police when the lady recognizes them in the street. They are taken to a jail as juvenile delinquents, and now their long career downwards in this dark part of society begins. They are split in two different cells. The police try to get some information about the criminal gang from them and, with the help of a trick, finally get Pasquale to reveal that Giuseppe's brother is one of the gangsters. For Giuseppe this betrayal is the end of their friendship. From now on they are driven into a negative spiral of actions against each other until it ends in tragedy.

We next find her working in a pub near a British military prison, using her sex appeal in the service of the enemy.

                    1944. Twenty-one year old Bridie Quilty grew up in the small Irish town of Ballygarry listening to her now deceased father Danny Quilty's highly exaggerated and fantastical stories of fighting during the Irish Revolution, those stories which Bridie could recite verbatim. From those stories which she believed wholeheartedly, she developed a hatred for the British, most specifically the British military, especially Oliver Cromwell. Now at the age of majority, Bridie, without telling her family or friends in Ballygarry her complete intentions, decides to move away to support her pro-Irish/anti-British alliances in whatever way she can. When her initial plan to join the IRA in Dublin falls through, she, upon a chance meeting with a man on a train, decides to head to England - Wynbridge - to work as a spy for Germany, her responsibilities largely to use her feminine wiles to gather low level intelligence from British officers. Instead of the romanticized view of the world she had in Ballygarry, she is exposed for the first time in her life to the hard cold realities of the world and of the current war. What ends up happening to her is largely affected by David Baynes, a British officer, who just won't leave her alone as he falls in love with her.

                    In the years following the Civil War, the town of Abilene, Kansas is poised on the brink of an explosive confrontation. A line has been drawn down the center of the town where the homesteaders and the cattlemen have come to a very uneasy truce. The delicate peace is inadvertantly shattered when a group of new homesteaders lay down their stakes on the cattlemen's side of town, upsetting the delicate balance that had existed thus far and sparking an all-out war between the farmers, who want the land tamed and property lines drawn, and the cowboys, who want the prairies to be open for their cattle to roam.

Many female employees of the company, thinking about how best to snag a husband during the man shortage while men are enlisted, slip personal notes into the shirts for the G.I.'s. After Trojan secretary Evie O'Connor decides that her current boyfriend - the officious DeWitt Pynchon, her boss - is not the one for her, she slips a note into a size 16½ shirt, figuring the recipient will be a big, strong man. The recipient is big, strong Private Edgar Larson, nicknamed Wolf for always being on the prowl for fast, fun women with no want of a long term commitment. Wolf dismisses the note, but Wolf's colleague, Private John McPherson, can tell that Evie is a sweet, pretty woman. John, a slight, plain man - he's no ""16½"" - writes back to Evie as himself, sending her Wolf's photograph passing it off as himself after she sends him hers. Unspoken, the two seem to be falling for each other, despite knowing that a relationship can never progress. When John and Wolf receive a furlough to New York, John thinks about actually meeting Evie. However, he has to figure out how to approach and get to know her in person as himself and not as the person in the photograph. And if Wolf ever found out what John was up to, he would try and move in on Evie himself.

According to nursing regulations at the time, her marriage means that she will no longer able to continue work. However, while she is there, McDonnell shows her the impact which a recent outbreak of Polio has had on the children around Toowoomba and cites a figure of 80 percent who have ended up with permanent disabilities and who face lives spent in callipers and on crutches.

Brack explains that every textbook ever written on the subject states that the muscles which extend as the childs limbs twist, is the one affected by Polio and that it was the Polio which caused it to become weak in the first place. He adds that the muscle on the opposite side of the limb takes control of it and it ends up pulling the limb out of alignment.However, Kennys treatment is based on just the opposite; that it is the shortened muscle which is diseased and that it has gone into what she calls a 'spasm', placing the sound muscle in a position where it is not being used - thus losing its ability to function. Her theory involves 're-educating' the under-used muscles by exercising until they are strong enough to resume normal use.This begins a forty year feud between the two, with Kenny seeing, first hand, the evidence that her treatment works (even with children Brack has given up on) and Brack clinging steadfastly to his established ideas - which involve immobilising the patients limbs rather than mobilising them - a treatment which Kenny sees as making the condition worse. Meanwhile, Kenny puts her marriage to Connors on hold, as she takes on the medical profession, and Connors is re-called for active service in Europe.Every time Kenny tries to have her treatment acknowledged, the medical establishment thwarts her but despite this, she gains notoriety by establishing clinics to prove her point. Children come form everywhere to be treated by her - with great success. But, still, the establishment will not budge. Eventually, a sympathetic Medical Director (John Litel), who is motivated by the great deal of public support being shown for Sister Kenny, sets up a Royal Commission.

                    Fictionalized account of the famed Australian Elizabeth Kenny whose revolutionary treatment for polio was hailed by many as the next best treatment to a cure itself. As presented in the film, Kenny came across her treatment of hot compresses and physiotherapy quite by accident. She almost immediately runs into the prejudice of the medical profession with the sole exception of a family medicine practitioner, Dr. McDonnell. She serves as a nurse in Europe in World War I and on her return to Australia has every intention of giving up nursing and marrying her longtime beau, Kevin Connors. She is drawn back into her work by the plight of the children she sees and sacrifices her personal life for the sake of her patients. After many years she eventually travels to the United States where she faces the same uphill battle against the medical profession. After several years, she eventually receives a more positive reception by some in the profession.

                    A semi-fictionalized account of the adult life of Elizabeth Kenny is presented. This phase of her story begins in the pre-WWI era, when she begins work as a well respected and well liked bush nurse in the Australian outback of Queensland, near where she grew up. She decides on this work rather than to take a job in a Brisbane hospital under her mentor, general practitioner Dr. McDonnell, as was expected because she feels she can do more good in the outback. In her work, she encounters several cases of what she will learn is infantile paralysis aka polio, for which there is no cure. The remote diagnosis is made by renowned Brisbane orthopedic surgeon Dr. Brack via Dr. McDonnell, who, in his telegram, tells Elizabeth to treat the symptoms as best she can. In doing so, she is able to cure all her cases to the point of the children being able to walk unaided. Elizabeth is unaware of what she has discovered until she goes into the city and meets with Drs. McDonnell and Brack and learns that polio victims are generally treated by immobilization of the affected muscles, which requires splints, braces and aids to assist in walking. While Dr. McDonnell realizes what Elizabeth has done, Dr. Brack, an expert in the field, dismisses her cases as not being infantile paralysis, and he refusing to allow Elizabeth to demonstrate on or treat any acute cases in the hospital, he fearing for the patients' safety and well-being. As Elizabeth begins to be convinced by Dr. McDonnell that she has indeed discovered a new more effective treatment for polio, she begins to butt heads with Dr. Brack, who is convinced that she is a quack, largely because she is not a physician, let alone not one specializing in orthopedics. Dr. Brack is also able to convince the same to the medical community in orthopedics in Australia. Elizabeth has to decide how far she will take this fight, which if she does make it her mission to try to treat cases of polio and to make the Kenny treatment as it is called the new method of treatment within the general medical community, will be incompatible with a family life of her own, Captain Kevin Connors with the Australian Army, a longtime beau, who wants to marry her.

    Synopsis
    A story based on the life of Elizabeth Kenny (Rosalind Russell). It begins, shortly before the start of World War I, as she takes up work as a nurse in the bush' near her parents farm - not far from Toowoomba (a regional centre in rural Queensland, Australia). Kenny shows a great deal of skill in her new job and is much loved by all those in her care.One night she is called out to a child named Doreen McIntyre (Doreen McCann), whose symptoms include contorted limbs and a stiffly curved spine. Not knowing what it could be she describes the symptoms, by telegraph, to a doctor friend - Dr Aeneas McDonnell (Alexander Know) - in Toowoomba. His reply indicates that the disease she has described is a clear-cut case of Infantile paralysis (Polio). His advice is to treat the child, according to the symptoms ... no more.Nurse Kenny is unsure what to do but, nevertheless, does what she thinks is best - which is to wrap the childs stiffened limbs in hot woolen sheets to relieve what she calls 'spasms'.

A young woman coerces two men to her apartment - they both think she's a woman of the evening - and the three, who don't reveal their names to one another make one wish - that they win the sweepstakes, each having an equal share. Only one name can be on the ticket - the woman's - but they each sign a written agreement, the name before theirs being covered. The agreement is that if they win the sweepstakes, they will enter the ticket into the horse race that follows, thus having the chance to go for the biggest stake. The three then go about their lives - the woman hopes to win back her husband, one of the men hopes to cover up his embezzlement, and the third, a small-time crook, forgets about the wish. Does their wish and the subsequent result change their lives? Or would their lives have all turned out the same had they not met?","
    
                    According to a legend, if three strangers gather before an idol of Kwan Yin (the Chinese goddess of fortune and destiny) on the night of the Chinese New Year and make a common wish, Kwan Yin will open her eyes and her heart and grant the wish. In London 1938 on the Chinese New Year, Crystal Shackleford has such an idol and decides to put the legend to the test. She picks two random strangers off the street, and puts the proposition to them. They decide that an ideal wish would be for a sweepstakes ticket they buy equal shares in to be a winner. After all, everyone needs money and a pot is very easy to divide equally, right?

                    1938 London. A young woman is able to coerce two men, total strangers, up to her flat. She doesn't disclose the reason for doing so until they are both there. She has a statue of Kwan Yin, a Chinese goddess of fortune and destiny, and of life and death, which she believes is able to grant one wish to three strangers on the stroke of midnight on Chinese New Year, which is just minutes away. She has a specific wish she wants granted, one she knows the other two would have no interest in, so she suggests the three make a wish for money, which would be a means to her end. Figuring they have nothing to lose, the two men agree, the actual method of that money being a sweepstakes ticket for a future horse race, which one of the men has in his possession, he only wanting two-thirds of the ticket's nominal cost from them for using it in this wish. They also agree that if the ticket is chosen, they will let the entire amount ride on the outcome of the race. It isn't until after the stroke of midnight that they learn only each others' names, and scant bits about their lives. She is Crystal Shackleford, who wants to use the money to prove to her husband, from who she is separated, that she is not after his money, leading to a reconciliation. The original owner of the sweepstakes ticket is Johnny West, who is in hiding as he, while drunk (a state he is in more often than not), was involved in a three-man robbery that led to the death of a policeman. One of the men is standing trial for the robbery and murder - he not giving up the other two - while the other is also in hiding with Johnny. The other stranger is barrister Jerome K.

    Synopsis
    It is said that on the Chinese New Year, the goddess Kwan Yin will grant a wish to three strangers. A young woman coerces two men to her apartment - they both think she's a woman of the evening - and the three, who don't reveal their names to one another make one wish - that they win the sweepstakes, each having an equal share. Only one name can be on the ticket - the woman's - but they each sign a written agreement, the name before theirs being covered. The agreement is that if they win the sweepstakes, they will enter the ticket into the horse race that follows, thus having the chance to go for the biggest stake. The three then go about their lives - the woman hopes to win back her husband, one of the men hopes to cover up his embezzlement, and the third, a small-time crook, forgets about the wish. Does their wish and the subsequent result change their lives? Or would their lives have all turned out the same had they not met?

                    It's the mid-nineteenth century. Young adult siblings (in chronological order) Charlotte Brontë, Branwell Brontë, Emily Brontë and Anne Brontë live a simple life with their vicar father and Aunt Elizabeth in remote Aldwark, Yorkshire adjacent to the desolate moors. All three sisters are poets and aspiring novelists, while Branwell is an artist, he who is considered the one with the most promise. As such, Charlotte and Anne do whatever they can to ensure that Branwell makes it to the royal academy of art in London to demonstrate his genius to the world, while Emily believes that Branwell is not emotionally ready to leave home. Emily is correct as Branwell's drinking overtakes all else in his life. Of the two older sisters, Charlotte is the more ambitious one who cannot see what is happening around her with much clarity, she who believes she has to see the world to be able to write about it, while Emily is the sullen one, who turns her thoughts more inwardly, is able quietly to see things with keen observation, and takes inspiration from the moors. Charlotte and Emily's lives are deeply affected by their respective relationships with Reverend Arthur Nicholls, the vicarage's latest curate. In large part because of Nicholls, both Emily and Charlotte are able to get their novels ""Wuthering Heights"" and ""Jane Eyre"" published, both under male pseudonyms, supposed ""brothers"" Ellis Bell and Currer Bell. It isn't until Charlotte, who ends up reveling in London due to the success of her novel, meets fellow already famous author William Makepeace Thackeray, whose ""Vanity Fair"" was published by the same publisher, that she can get a better understanding of Emily, far greater an understanding than she was able to obtain in their years together as sisters.

                    G.I. Nick Blake, a never charged con man in his pre-military life, has just received an honorable discharge from the army on medical reasons. Rather than return to his old life, he plans to settle down in New York, his hometown, with his girlfriend Toni Blackburn and the small cache of money he amassed prior to the war: $50,000. When that plan does not pan out, he decides to head to Los Angeles with his con man friend Al Doyle and live it up until he decides on a more permanent course for his life. He is informed by Pop Gruber, an aging mentor doing solely penny-ante street cons now in L.A., of a potential big mark. Doc Ganson, a former con associate, found the mark, lonely widow Gladys Halvorsen worth $2 million, but does not have either the bankroll or the charms to carry out the con on Gladys himself. With Al running interference for him, Nick agrees both to bankroll and carry out the con, he negotiating two-thirds of the take for himself, leaving Doc and his two associates a minimum of $30,000. Although Doc does not like the conditions, he feels he has no choice but to accept the offer as he is desperate for a score to get himself back on his feet. The con is complicated as Nick, using the alias Nick Lloyd, discovers that Gladys is accompanied in Los Angeles by her business manager, Charles Manning, who may be a little more careful than Gladys with her money. Further complications may ensue as Nick is recognized by others who know him as Nick Blake, as Toni comes looking for him to get her own cut in whatever he is doing, and most importantly as Nick and Gladys really do fall for each other. Nick has to decide how to handle the con knowing that a desperate Doc will not let him get away without his negotiated share, a violent Doc who may use harder tactics if he knows that Nick is wanting a life with Gladys and her $2 million.
