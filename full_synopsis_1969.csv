Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford), the leaders of the famous Hole in the Wall Gang, are planning another bank robbery. As they return to their hideout in Hole-in-the-Wall, they find out that the gang has selected a new leader, Harvey Logan. He challenges Butch to a knife fight, which Butch wins, using a ruse. Logan had the idea to rob the Union Pacific Flyer train instead of banks. He wanted to rob it twice, the idea being that the return would be considered safe and therefore more money might be involved. Butch takes this idea as his own.The first robbery goes very well and the Marshal of the next town can't manage to raise a posse. Butch and Sundance listen to his attempts, enjoying themselves. Sundance's lover, Etta Place (Katherine Ross), is introduced. But obviously both men vie for her attention as she also goes bike-riding with Butch, a dialogue-free part of the film, accompanied by ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.""The second robbery goes wrong. Not only does Butch use too much dynamite to blow the safe, but also a second train arrives, which is carrying a posse of six heavily armed men on horseback that has been specially outfitted to hunt down Butch and Sundance. The gang flees, but the entire posse follows Butch and Sundance. They try hiding in a brothel in a nearby town that night, but are betrayed. When they discover that the posse is continuing to follow their trail, they try riding double on a single horse in the hope that the posse will split up, but that fails. They then arrive in a nearby town and try to arrange an amnesty with the help of a friendly sheriff (Jeff Corey) of Carbon County. But the sheriff tells them they have no chance of getting one, and that they will be hunted down until they are killed by the posse.Still on the run the next day, they muse about the identities of their pursuers. They fixate on Lord Baltimore, a famous Indian tracker, and Joe Lefors, a tough, renowned lawman, identifiable by his white skimmer hat (which the lead posse member is wearing). After climbing some mountains, they suddenly find themselves trapped on the edge of a canyon. With their unseen pursuers on their tail, they decide to jump into the river far below, even though Sundance can't swim and would prefer to fight.Later that day, they arrive at Etta's house and learn from the local newspapers all about the posse and the identities of their pursuers and that they have been paid to stay together until they kill Butch and the Kid. They decide that it's time to leave the country: destination Bolivia!After a montage of showing Butch, Sundance and Etta on their travels to New York, they arrive in a small Bolivian village at the end of the world. Sundance already resents their choice. Their first attempted bank robbery fails before it gets off the ground, since they are unable to speak or understand Spanish. Etta teaches them the words they need. The following robbery is clumsily executed, as Butch still needs his crib sheet. At each succeeding robbery they appear to improve, until they are sought by the authorities all over Bolivia.However their confidence drops one evening, as Butch, Sundance and Etta are having dinner at a fancy restaurant in a nearby town, when they see a man wearing a white straw hat standing on the other side of the street talking to a few men. Fearing that Lefors is once again after them, Butch suggests going straight, so as not to attract Lefors' attention.They get their first honest job as payroll guards in a mine, directed by an American named Garris (Strother Martin). However, on their first working day, they are attacked by highwaymen. Garris is killed and Butch and Sundance are forced to kill the Bolivian robbers. Ironically, Butch had never killed a man in his entire criminal career, but while they are attempting to go straight, he is forced to kill the bandits. Since they seem unable to escape violence, regardless of their occupation, they decide to return to robbery. That evening, Etta decides to leave them as she senses that their days are numbered and she doesn't want to watch them die.A few days later, Butch and Sundance attack a payroll mule train in the jungle, taking the money and the mule. When they arrive in the nearest town, San Vicente, a stable boy recognizes the brand on the mule's backside and alerts the local police. While Butch and Sundance are eating at a local eatery, the police arrive and a climactic gun battle begins.The two of them manage to find shelter in an empty house, but they're soon low on ammunition. Butch makes a run to the mule to fetch the rest of the ammunition while Sundance covers him, shooting several Bolivian policemen. But even the ""fastest gun in the West"" cannot match the twenty or more Bolivian policemen at once. Butch manages to retrieve the ammunition and runs back to the house, but they are both wounded. While tending to their wounds in the house, about 100 soldiers of the Bolivian cavalry arrive and surround the place, eager to get at the notorious 'Bandidos Yanquis'.The wounded pair discuss where they will be going next, realizing that their time is up (Butch suggests Australia, where at least they speak English). They dash out of the house in a futile attempt to get to their horses. The image freezes and slowly turns to a sepia tone tintype while a voice is heard ordering: ""Fuego!"" (Fire), followed by the sound of hundreds of rifles being fired in three consecutive volleys....","
    
                    Butch and Sundance are the two leaders of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. Butch is all ideas, Sundance is all action and skill. The west is becoming civilized and when Butch and Sundance rob a train once too often, a special posse begins trailing them no matter where they run. Over rock, through towns, across rivers, the group is always just behind them. When they finally escape through sheer luck, Butch has another idea, ""Let's go to Bolivia"". Based on the exploits of the historical characters.

                    In the turn of the century American west, Robert LeRoy Parker and Harry Longabaugh are better known by their aliases, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, partners and arguably the most renowned outlaws in the area, they who hold up banks or trains. Within the partnership, Butch is the brains, Sundance the shooting brawn. Despite their outlaw status, they are seen as an affable duo by those that know them, even by many of their so called adversaries. Butch has compiled the Hole in the Wall Gang, named after his hideout in the Wyoming mountains, and is its de facto leader primarily because he was the one who brought them all together. But as time goes on, Butch and Sundance are finding that changing circumstances are making their work more and more difficult, which leads to others within the gang questioning Butch's leadership. Following one of the gang's jobs holding up a train, a posse of six men on horseback are after them, not the gang as a whole but rather only Butch and Sundance. The duo have to figure who the six men are to find out their end goal. In trying to get away, they are assisted by their friend, schoolteacher Etta Place who is officially Sundance's girlfriend. She ended up with Sundance instead of Butch only because the two of them saw each other first. Butch and Sundance will learn how far the posse will go to get what they were tasked to do, and in turn Butch and Sundance will also learn how far they will go to preserve their lifestyle as well as their lives.

He heads to New York City hoping to succeed as a male prostitute for women. Initially unsuccessful, he succeeds in bedding a well-to-do middle-aged New Yorker (Sylvia Miles), but Joe ends up giving her money.Joe then meets Enrico Salvatore ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a street con man with a limp who takes $20 from Joe by offering to introduce him to a known pimp, who turns out to be a Bible thumper (John McGiver). Joe flees the encounter in pursuit of Ratso. Joe spends his days wandering the city and sitting in his hotel room. Soon broke, he is locked out of his hotel room and most of his belongings are impounded.Joe tries to make money by agreeing to receive oral sex from a young man (Bob Balaban) in a movie theater. When Joe learns that he has no money, Joe threatens him and asks for his watch, but eventually lets him go. The following day, Joe spots Ratso and angrily shakes him down. Ratso offers to share the apartment in which he is squatting in a condemned building. Joe accepts reluctantly, and they begin a ""business relationship"" as hustlers. As they develop a bond, Ratso's health, which has never been good, grows steadily worse.Joe's story is told through flashbacks throughout the film. His grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him, though his grandmother frequently neglects him as well. He also has a tragic relationship with Annie, a local girl. Ratso's back story comes through stories he tells Joe. His father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoe-shiner, who worked in a subway station. He developed a bad back, and ""coughed his lungs out from breathin' in that wax all day"". Ratso learned shining from his father but won't stoop so low as to do so. He dreams of moving one day to Miami.An unusual couple approach Joe and Ratso in a diner and hand Joe a flyer, inviting him to a party. They enter a Warhol-esque party scene (with Warhol superstars in cameos). Joe smokes a joint, thinking it's a normal cigarette and, after taking a pill someone offered, begins to hallucinate. He leaves the party with a socialite (Brenda Vaccaro), who agrees to pay $20 for spending the night with him, but Joe cannot perform. They play Scribbage together, and Joe shows his limited academic prowess. She teasingly suggests that Joe may be gay, and he is suddenly able to perform.In the morning, the socialite sets up her friend as Joe's next customer, and it appears that his career is on its way. When Joe returns home, Ratso is bedridden and feverish. Ratso refuses medical help (because he has no money or health insurance) and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate, Joe picks up a man in an amusement arcade (Barnard Hughes), and when things go wrong, robs the man when he tries to pay with a religious medallion instead of cash. With the cash he steals, Joe buys two bus tickets. On the journey, Ratso's frail physical condition further deteriorates. At a rest stop, Joe buys new clothing for Ratso and himself, discarding his cowboy outfit. As they near Miami, Joe talks of getting a regular job, only to realize Ratso has died. The driver tells Joe there is nothing else to do, but continue on to Miami. The film closes with Joe, alone and afraid, seated with his arm around his dead friend.","

                    Attired in urban cowboy garb, Joe Buck is a naive Texas hayseed having just arrived in New York City to make it big as a gigolo solely to his preferred clientèle of rich, attractive women. His belief in his charms on the female persuasion has been reinforced his entire life, he believes, by all the females with who he has had encounters, past and present, family, friends and lovers. However, life in New York City is not all he wants it to be, being out-hustled by most people he meets, they who he does not have the fortitude to hustle right back to get what he was originally due. Largely out of having nowhere else to turn, he eventually befriends one of those hustlers, a sickly man with a gimp leg named Enrico Rizzo, who is nicknamed Ratso by those who don't much like him, that nickname which he doesn't much like. Joe ends up squatting with Ratso in a room he has found in a condemned and thus otherwise empty building. As they lean on each other for support, they work together for their mutual benefit and survival. But as Ratso's health deteriorates over the winter, Joe changes his focus to achieving Ratso's dream of moving to Miami.

    Synopsis
    As the film opens, Joe Buck (Jon Voight), a young Texan working as a dishwasher, dresses in new cowboy clothing, packs a suitcase, and quits his job. He heads to New York City hoping to succeed as a male prostitute for women. Initially unsuccessful, he succeeds in bedding a well-to-do middle-aged New Yorker (Sylvia Miles), but Joe ends up giving her money.Joe then meets Enrico Salvatore ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a street con man with a limp who takes $20 from Joe by offering to introduce him to a known pimp, who turns out to be a Bible thumper (John McGiver). Joe flees the encounter in pursuit of Ratso. Joe spends his days wandering the city and sitting in his hotel room. Soon broke, he is locked out of his hotel room and most of his belongings are impounded.Joe tries to make money by agreeing to receive oral sex from a young man (Bob Balaban) in a movie theater. When Joe learns that he has no money, Joe threatens him and asks for his watch, but eventually lets him go. The following day, Joe spots Ratso and angrily shakes him down. Ratso offers to share the apartment in which he is squatting in a condemned building. Joe accepts reluctantly, and they begin a ""business relationship"" as hustlers. As they develop a bond, Ratso's health, which has never been good, grows steadily worse.Joe's story is told through flashbacks throughout the film. His grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him, though his grandmother frequently neglects him as well. He also has a tragic relationship with Annie, a local girl. Ratso's back story comes through stories he tells Joe. His father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoe-shiner, who worked in a subway station. He developed a bad back, and ""coughed his lungs out from breathin' in that wax all day"". Ratso learned shining from his father but won't stoop so low as to do so. He dreams of moving one day to Miami.An unusual couple approach Joe and Ratso in a diner and hand Joe a flyer, inviting him to a party. They enter a Warhol-esque party scene (with Warhol superstars in cameos). Joe smokes a joint, thinking it's a normal cigarette and, after taking a pill someone offered, begins to hallucinate. He leaves the party with a socialite (Brenda Vaccaro), who agrees to pay $20 for spending the night with him, but Joe cannot perform. They play Scribbage together, and Joe shows his limited academic prowess. She teasingly suggests that Joe may be gay, and he is suddenly able to perform.In the morning, the socialite sets up her friend as Joe's next customer, and it appears that his career is on its way. When Joe returns home, Ratso is bedridden and feverish. Ratso refuses medical help (because he has no money or health insurance) and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate, Joe picks up a man in an amusement arcade (Barnard Hughes), and when things go wrong, robs the man when he tries to pay with a religious medallion instead of cash. With the cash he steals, Joe buys two bus tickets. On the journey, Ratso's frail physical condition further deteriorates. At a rest stop, Joe buys new clothing for Ratso and himself, discarding his cowboy outfit. As they near Miami, Joe talks of getting a regular job, only to realize Ratso has died. The driver tells Joe there is nothing else to do, but continue on to Miami. The film closes with Joe, alone and afraid, seated with his arm around his dead friend.

"5","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064757/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film opens with Miss Moneypenny and M at MI6 headquarters in London, under the shell corporation known as 'Universal Exports', discussing the whereabouts of MI6's best ""00"" agent, James Bond. Bond happens to be driving on a country coastal road in Portugal in his Aston-Martin when he's passed by a woman driving a Mercury Cougar. The woman drives to a nearby beach and tries to drown herself in the surf. When Bond drags her back, he is attacked by several thugs, whom he is able to beat in hand-to-hand combat. When he turns his attention back to the mysterious woman, he sees her driving off in her Cougar. Bond, puzzled by the turn of events, says ""This never happened to the other fellow!"", (presumably a reference to the departure of Sean Connery from the series).Later, at a casino, the same woman Bond found on the beach, Contessa Teresa ""Tracy"" di Vicenzo, is gambling and finds herself unable to pay her debt. Bond pays the tab for her and she invites him to her room to ""repay"" him. Bond is again attacked by another man, whom he beats. When he returns to his own room, Tracy is there waiting, steals Bond's pistol and threatens to kill him ""for a thrill"". Bond disarms her and demands to know about the man in her room; Tracy has no answer. Tracy leaves the hotel the next morning and when James tries to trail her, he is apprehended by several more men who take him to Tracy's father, Marc-Ange Draco, head of a powerful European crime organization which is called Union Course. The gangster offers Bond a sizable dowry if he'll marry his troubled daughter after he tells Bond about Tracy's suicial depression since her mother's death. Bond turns down the offer but agrees to continue dating Tracy if Draco will help him find SPECTRE's sinister leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, whom Bond has been unsuccessfully tracking for the past two years.When he returns to MI6 in London, M tells Bond that his obsession with finding Blofeld must end. Bitter, James gives Miss Moneypenny his resignation and cleans out his office. Moneypenny, however, subverts Bond's wishes and enters a request for two weeks leave, a change both James and M realize is for the better. Now able to pursue Blofeld on his own time, James first goes back to Portugal for a birthday party being thrown for Draco. While there, Tracy reveals that she knows about the deal her father struck with Bond; she does not want to be used this way and demands her father help Bond. Draco relents and tells Bond to check out a lead in Bern, Switzerland. Tracy and Bond officially begin their courtship.In Bern, Bond infiltrates the law firm of a man named Gebruder Gumbol and finds letters from Blofeld to the London College of Arms. Returning to London and meeting with an expert at the College (who shows the agent the Bond family coat-of-arms) he informs Bond that Blofeld is attempting to claim the title of the Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp of Switzerland. Bond assumes the identity of an Arms delegate, Sir Hilary Bray, to investigate further. When he reports to M with his new leads, he is given permission to take up the case once again.Acting as Bray, Bond travels back to Switzerland to Blofeld's latest compound at the top of Piz Gloria, a peak in the Swiss Alps. The location is accessible only by cable car or helicopter. There he finds Blofeld who has taken up the identity of an epidemiologist who specializes in allergy research. Bond finds that Blofeld's guests are about 10 beautiful women, all allergy sufferers, whose illnesses have allegedly been cured. Though he is essentially imprisoned in his room at night, Bond figures a way to open the door and goes to the room of a woman, named Ruby, who surreptitiously gave him the number and has sex with her. While they lay together a strange light and sound treatment begins over the bed and the woman appears hypnotized. Blofeld's ""treatment"" involves cassette tapes that induce hypnotism. Bond leaves her room, returning to his own where he finds another one of the women, named Nancy, waiting. He seduces her as well. Bond later sneaks up on a meeting involving the girls; they are given Christmas presents that contain a communication device and a specialized deadly virus that each girl will release in a different region of the world unless Blofeld's demands are met that the United States gives him a pardon and recognizes him as a count.The next day Bond's cover is blown by Blofeld's assistant, Irma Bunt, when he sneaks out of his room to go into Ruby's room and finds Irma there. Bond is taken to Blofeld who identifies him (after Bond made a slip earlier to Blofeld that the real Bray wouldn't have made) and imprisons him in the cold gear room of the compound's cable-car. Bond is able to escape the room and steals a skiing uniform and skis rapidly down the mountain as Blofeld and several of his men give chase. Bond arrives in the village of Muren and meets Tracy and the two escape Bunt and several of Blofeld's henchmen in her car when they drive through a car race. Bond and Tracy find a secluded barn to hold up for the night; Bond proposes to Tracy and she accepts, but will not allow him to sleep together with her. She relents when Bond pulls her into his own bedding.In the morning, Tracy and Bond ski away from the barn, with Blofeld and a few of his men close behind. When it seems like Bond and Tracy will escape, Blofeld causes an avalanche that they are unable to stay ahead of and are buried. Blofeld has his men retrieve Tracy and leave Bond for dead. Bond returns to London, seeking a way to rescue Tracy and stop Blofeld's plan. M refuses to launch an assault on Piz Gloria for diplomatic reasons. Bond instead enlists the help of Draco, who provides helicopters and a strike team from Union Course.At the Piz Gloria, Blofeld keeps Tracy in his company and even proposes to her. Just then, Bond, Draco and their men attack the Piz Gloria and stop Blofeld from sending his orders to the women. Bond rescues Tracy and she flies off with her father. Bond finds Blofeld escaping in a bobsled and chases him in a second one, catching up and boarding Blofeld's sled. They tussle briefly until Bond is able to hold Blofeld up to catch a forked tree branch, leaving him there injured and unconscious. Bond gains control of the sled and stops it.A lavish wedding is thrown for Bond and Tracy and they are married. After the reception, Bond leaves with Tracy in his Aston-Martin. They travel a few miles and Bond stops to remove some of the flower chains decorating their car. Tracy reflects that Bond has given her more than a husband, she now has a future. Suddenly, a car driven by a very-much alive Blofeld (now wearing a neck brace) races by and Irma Bunt opens fire on Bond's car with an assault rifle. Bond survives the drive-by attack by ducking behind the car and recognizes Blofeld immediately and jumps back in the car with Tracy to give chase, but Tracy is dead; hit in the head by a bullet that went through the windshield killing her instantly. As Bond holds her, a policeman stops by after hearing the shooting. Bond tells him that there's ""no hurry"" and that they ""have all the time in the world."" On that sad note, 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' comes to a close.","
    
                    George Lazenby steps into the role of James Bond and is sent on his first mission. For help with Draco, he must become very close friends with his daughter, Tracy, and heads off to hunt down Ernst Stavro Blofeld one more time. This takes him to Switzerland, where he must pose as Sir Hilary Bray to find out the secret plan of Blofeld. The facility is covered with Blofeld's guards as well as his hench-woman, Irma Bunt. What has Blofeld got in mind this time? Can Bond keep up this act for much longer? Are ANY Bond girls safe?

A bulldozer pulls the remains from the tunnel and dumps them down a steep alpine gorge. Some time later dapper mobster Charlie Croker (Caine) is released from prison. He soon meets with the widow (Goldoni) of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann (Brazzi), victim of the Miura crash. She gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the attention of the Italian Mafia. The plans outline a way to rob the payroll of Turin-based automaker Fiat, and spirit it out of Italy.Croker decides to continue the plan despite the risks, but needs a large, well-equipped gang. He breaks into jail to meet Mr Bridger (Coward), a criminal who runs a gangland empire from prison. Croker explains ""the Italian Job"" but Bridger dismisses the plan out of hand, and indeed orders Croker be given ""a good going-over"" for disturbing his privacy.Bridger changes his mind shortly after, when it is announced that China is delivering a consignment of gold to Turin, as down-payment to Fiat for the building of a car factory.

    Synopsis
    A Lamborghini Miura drives through the Italian Alps, enters a tunnel, crashes and explodes. A bulldozer pulls the remains from the tunnel and dumps them down a steep alpine gorge. Some time later dapper mobster Charlie Croker (Caine) is released from prison. He soon meets with the widow (Goldoni) of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann (Brazzi), victim of the Miura crash. She gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the attention of the Italian Mafia. The plans outline a way to rob the payroll of Turin-based automaker Fiat, and spirit it out of Italy.Croker decides to continue the plan despite the risks, but needs a large, well-equipped gang. He breaks into jail to meet Mr Bridger (Coward), a criminal who runs a gangland empire from prison. Croker explains ""the Italian Job"" but Bridger dismisses the plan out of hand, and indeed orders Croker be given ""a good going-over"" for disturbing his privacy.Bridger changes his mind shortly after, when it is announced that China is delivering a consignment of gold to Turin, as down-payment to Fiat for the building of a car factory. With this backing, Croker assembles a group including computer expert Professor Peach (Hill), electronics handler Birkinshaw (Emney) and several getaway drivers. The plan calls for Peach to infect Turin's computerised traffic control to create a paralyzing traffic jam that will prevent the police from recapturing the gold.

                    Squadron Leader Quint Munroe, an RAF pilot in World War II, has a hard time dealing with the presumed death in action of fellow Sq. Leader David 'Scotty' Scott, whose family practically raised him when he was orphaned, so they were like brothers. RAF Air Commodore Hufford has a crucial task for Quint, who is no longer serving in the squadron: a reconnaissance flight over the château de Charlon, a castle in occupied France, where the Nazis are probably developing a new generation of flying bombs; the defenses are indeed suspiciously tight. When analyzed, the photos show the castle grounds harbor an underground launching tunnel, and Quint gets a nearly impossible precision top-secret mission: select and train a team in only 10 days, when the French underground believes the first launch is planned, to 'aim' a new type of bouncing bomb into the tunnel, to blow up the whole Luftwaffe installation. Quint falls in love with Scotty's young widow Beth Scott, whose crippled brother, Flight Lieutenant Douglas Shelton, is on his team. After the Gestapo catches and tortures a French underground member, the Luftwaffe drops a film showing the castle being filled with captured RAF men, one of which is, to Quint and Doug's shock, Scotty, not dead after all, causing a dilemma for which Quint presents an even more daring solution, to be prepared in a few days...

"10","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065214/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The movie takes place in 1913, during the height of the Mexican Revolution. In the fictional town of San Rafael, Texas, the Wild Bunch - led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), and also including Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine), Lyle and Tector Gorch (Warren Oates and Ben Johnson), Angel (Jaime Sanchez), Buck (Rayford Barnes), and Clarence 'Crazy' Lee (Bo Hopkins), among others - enters the town, with half of them dressed as United States cavalry soldiers. They ride past a group of children who are torturing a pair of scorpions by putting them on a hill of red ants (this image was suggested by Emilio Fernandez; he said that he and his friends had done similar things as children), a very symbolic image which symbolizes the events of the film. The gang breaks into the bank and holds it up, but on the roof of a hotel across the street is a ragtag posse of bounty hunters, led by Patrick Harrigan (Albert Dekker), a railroad detective, and Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), a former member of the gang being ambushed, along with scruffy bounty hunters Coffer (Strother Martin), T.C. (L.Q. Jones), Huey (Paul Harper), and Jess (stuntman Bill Hart).The gang's escape is interrupted by the local temperance union, which is holding a parade in the town, led by Reverend Wainscoat (Dub Taylor), playing ""Shall We Gather At The River?"" (a hymn used as a funeral song in innumerable John Ford Westerns, used here for ironic effect). Various members of the gang, inside and out of the bank, spot the bounty hunters and Pike uses a bank teller as a decoy, throwing him out of the bank to draw the fire of the bounty hunters, allowing for the gang's escape.A vicious, confusing gunfight occurs, with gang members, bounty hunters, and civilians caught in the crossfires, resulting in numerous deaths. Only six members of the gang escape - Pike, Dutch, the Gorches, Angel, and Buck, who has been shot in the face and blinded - and the rest of the gang is killed. Crazy Lee is left behind to hold the bank patrons as hostages; when Harrigan and Thornton's gang descend from the roof of the hotel to scavenge from the various dead bodies, he is ultimately killed by Harrigan. Outside of town, Pike executes Buck, who is unable to continue riding due to his injuries.The surviving gang members arrive at a small Mexican town, where another gang member, the old Freddie Sykes (Edmond O'Brien), is waiting with horses and saddles. In this scene, they realize that the robbery was a set-up by the railroad - all of their earnings have been nothing but bags of steel washers. The excitable Gorches very nearly turn on Angel and Sykes, but they are held in check by Pike and Dutch. Later in the film, Sykes reveals to Pike that Crazy Lee - who had been deliberately left behind by Pike - was his grandson.We also learn as the film progresses that Thornton has been given his parole in exchange for his tracking down his old colleague Pike. Though Thornton continually disparages his posse as ""gutter trash"", he reluctantly continues his pursuit of the gang throughout the film. Pike reveals through flashback (most of which were cut by the studio in the original version) how he abandoned Thornton to the railroad detectives, and also how he developed his painful leg wound (he had an affair with a Mexican woman, played by Aurora Clavell, and was shot by her husband) which he suffers from throughout the film.Pike and his men return to Angel's village and remain there for a day and night. Pike learns from the village elder, Don Jose (Chano Urueta) that the village has been attacked by General Mapache (Emilio Fernandez), a Mexican general working for the government of General Huerta. Angel's father was hanged, and his girlfriend was taken by Mapache for his own. Though he tells Pike that he will not avenge his father, Angel remains obsessed with getting his vengeance on Mapache throughout the film.The gang then heads to the small town of Agua Verde, Mapache's headquarters, to trade their horses. As they go to visit the General, Angel sees Teresa, his girlfriend, presenting a pony to Mapache. Angel shoots her in the arms of Mapache, nearly leading to a tense confrontation between the Mexicans and the gang, but Pike and Dutch diffuse it. They are later hired by Mapache and his German military advisers to steal a US arms shipment for him, which they agree to for a price of ten thousand dollars - but Angel insists that they allow him to take a case of rifles to his village to protect them from Mapache. Pike and Dutch agree.The Bunch holds up the train and kills the soldiers guarding the weapons, but Thornton and his posse are also on board the train and pursues them to a bridge over the Rio Grande, themselves being pursued by a squad of inept cavalrymen. After a confusing three-way shootout, the Bunch recrosses the border into Mexico. Thornton and his men are blown into the river when the dynamite wired to the bridge explodes, and the gang makes their escape. After getting themselves back together, Thornton and his men pursue the gang into Mexico.Out on the trail toward Agua Verde, the Bunch are met by a small group of Pancho Villa's men -- Angel had convinced his comrades to give one of the sixteen cases of rifles to these men to use in their fight against Mapache and Huerta. Angel's Mexican comrades silently sneak up on the Bunch after dark and hold them hostage for a few minutes until Angel can square things. Pike and Dutch seem quite impressed with the ability of the revolutionaries to get the drop on them, however the Gorches are angry that they'd been made to look like fools. The Mexicans leave as silently as they arrived.While waiting for word of the Bunch's robbery at a telegraph station, Mapache and his entourage are attacked by forces led by Pancho Villa and routed. Mapache sends one of his subordinates, Captain Herrera (Alfonso Arau), to meet the Bunch in a ravine with a large group of soldiers, but the confrontation nearly turns violent after a nervous Mexican soldier fires at the wagon holding the weapons. The Bunch has wired the wagon with dynamite, and Pike lights the fuse until Herrera diffuses the situation by executing the soldier who has fired on the gang. The Bunch then elaborately hides their weapons haul - fifteen cases of rifles, plus a Browning M1917 machine gun - and gives it in installments to Mapache in exchange for their money. Unfortunately, when Angel and Dutch arrive in town, Mapache reveals that he has been tipped off by Teresa's father of Angel's perfidy -- for killing his daughter, the father revealed to Mapache that one of the cases of rifles was given to the rebels by Angel. Angel is captured by Mapache's men, and Dutch simply rides off.The gang regroups at a canyon outside of town, waiting for Sykes to return with their packhorses, and they argue over what to do. Then they watch as Sykes is ambushed and seriously wounded by Thornton's posse. Pike decides to abandon his old friend, who is being pursued hotly by Thornton's men, and return to Agua Verde to retrieve Angel. Mapache refuses to turn over Angel, who has been badly tortured, and invites the gang to spend the night in town whoring and drinking.The next morning, Pike decides to make a final stand. The four gang members load up shotguns, rifles, and semi-automatic sidearms and march through Agua Verde to Mapache's headquarters. After demanding Angel's release again, a drunken Mapache slits Angel's throat, and he is subsequently gunned down by Pike and Dutch. After a tense moment, the drunken Mexican soldiers under Mapache react, unsure of what to do. After a few seconds, Dutch looks at Pike and laughs, actually thinking that they might get away with killing Mapache over it being a justifiable killing. However, Pike is not amused. Apparently, he has already decided to die there. Pike takes deliberate aim at Captain Mohr, Mapache's adviser, and shoots him dead.At this point, a vicious, bloody gunfight (referred to as the ""Battle of the Bloody Porch"" by the film's crew) results as the Bunch shoots their way through Mapache's officers and seizes the machine gun. They inflict scores of casualties on the Mexican solders but finally fall due to the sheer number of their foe. Lyle and Tector are shot repeatedly as they try to man the machine gun; after being shot in the back by a Mexican prostitute (whom he kills afterwords) Pike is finally killed by a Mexican boy and other soldiers in a hail of bullets while manning the machine gun; Dutch is gunned down rushing to his side.After the battle, with Mapache's army nearly wiped out, Thornton and his surviving men ride into town and begin looting the dead bodies of the Mexican soldiers and their prey, while Thornton looks at his fallen colleagues in pity, taking Pike's unused revolver. Thornton declines to join the bounty hunters as they return to the United States, remaining at Agua Verde; they are ambushed and killed somewhere down the trail.In the final scene, Sykes, Don Jose, and a large group of Villista rebels later arrive at the town, and Thornton decides to join them.","

            The synopsis below may give away important plot points.
    
    Synopsis
    The movie takes place in 1913, during the height of the Mexican Revolution. In the fictional town of San Rafael, Texas, the Wild Bunch - led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), and also including Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine), Lyle and Tector Gorch (Warren Oates and Ben Johnson), Angel (Jaime Sanchez), Buck (Rayford Barnes), and Clarence 'Crazy' Lee (Bo Hopkins), among others - enters the town, with half of them dressed as United States cavalry soldiers. They ride past a group of children who are torturing a pair of scorpions by putting them on a hill of red ants (this image was suggested by Emilio Fernandez; he said that he and his friends had done similar things as children), a very symbolic image which symbolizes the events of the film. The gang breaks into the bank and holds it up, but on the roof of a hotel across the street is a ragtag posse of bounty hunters, led by Patrick Harrigan (Albert Dekker), a railroad detective, and Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), a former member of the gang being ambushed, along with scruffy bounty hunters Coffer (Strother Martin), T.C. (L.Q. Jones), Huey (Paul Harper), and Jess (stuntman Bill Hart).The gang's escape is interrupted by the local temperance union, which is holding a parade in the town, led by Reverend Wainscoat (Dub Taylor), playing ""Shall We Gather At The River?"" (a hymn used as a funeral song in innumerable John Ford Westerns, used here for ironic effect). Various members of the gang, inside and out of the bank, spot the bounty hunters and Pike uses a bank teller as a decoy, throwing him out of the bank to draw the fire of the bounty hunters, allowing for the gang's escape.A vicious, confusing gunfight occurs, with gang members, bounty hunters, and civilians caught in the crossfires, resulting in numerous deaths. Only six members of the gang escape - Pike, Dutch, the Gorches, Angel, and Buck, who has been shot in the face and blinded - and the rest of the gang is killed. Crazy Lee is left behind to hold the bank patrons as hostages; when Harrigan and Thornton's gang descend from the roof of the hotel to scavenge from the various dead bodies, he is ultimately killed by Harrigan. Outside of town, Pike executes Buck, who is unable to continue riding due to his injuries.The surviving gang members arrive at a small Mexican town, where another gang member, the old Freddie Sykes (Edmond O'Brien), is waiting with horses and saddles. In this scene, they realize that the robbery was a set-up by the railroad - all of their earnings have been nothing but bags of steel washers. The excitable Gorches very nearly turn on Angel and Sykes, but they are held in check by Pike and Dutch. Later in the film, Sykes reveals to Pike that Crazy Lee - who had been deliberately left behind by Pike - was his grandson.We also learn as the film progresses that Thornton has been given his parole in exchange for his tracking down his old colleague Pike. Though Thornton continually disparages his posse as ""gutter trash"", he reluctantly continues his pursuit of the gang throughout the film. Pike reveals through flashback (most of which were cut by the studio in the original version) how he abandoned Thornton to the railroad detectives, and also how he developed his painful leg wound (he had an affair with a Mexican woman, played by Aurora Clavell, and was shot by her husband) which he suffers from throughout the film.Pike and his men return to Angel's village and remain there for a day and night. Pike learns from the village elder, Don Jose (Chano Urueta) that the village has been attacked by General Mapache (Emilio Fernandez), a Mexican general working for the government of General Huerta. Angel's father was hanged, and his girlfriend was taken by Mapache for his own. Though he tells Pike that he will not avenge his father, Angel remains obsessed with getting his vengeance on Mapache throughout the film.The gang then heads to the small town of Agua Verde, Mapache's headquarters, to trade their horses. As they go to visit the General, Angel sees Teresa, his girlfriend, presenting a pony to Mapache. Angel shoots her in the arms of Mapache, nearly leading to a tense confrontation between the Mexicans and the gang, but Pike and Dutch diffuse it. They are later hired by Mapache and his German military advisers to steal a US arms shipment for him, which they agree to for a price of ten thousand dollars - but Angel insists that they allow him to take a case of rifles to his village to protect them from Mapache. Pike and Dutch agree.The Bunch holds up the train and kills the soldiers guarding the weapons, but Thornton and his posse are also on board the train and pursues them to a bridge over the Rio Grande, themselves being pursued by a squad of inept cavalrymen. After a confusing three-way shootout, the Bunch recrosses the border into Mexico. Thornton and his men are blown into the river when the dynamite wired to the bridge explodes, and the gang makes their escape. After getting themselves back together, Thornton and his men pursue the gang into Mexico.Out on the trail toward Agua Verde, the Bunch are met by a small group of Pancho Villa's men -- Angel had convinced his comrades to give one of the sixteen cases of rifles to these men to use in their fight against Mapache and Huerta. Angel's Mexican comrades silently sneak up on the Bunch after dark and hold them hostage for a few minutes until Angel can square things. Pike and Dutch seem quite impressed with the ability of the revolutionaries to get the drop on them, however the Gorches are angry that they'd been made to look like fools. The Mexicans leave as silently as they arrived.While waiting for word of the Bunch's robbery at a telegraph station, Mapache and his entourage are attacked by forces led by Pancho Villa and routed. Mapache sends one of his subordinates, Captain Herrera (Alfonso Arau), to meet the Bunch in a ravine with a large group of soldiers, but the confrontation nearly turns violent after a nervous Mexican soldier fires at the wagon holding the weapons. The Bunch has wired the wagon with dynamite, and Pike lights the fuse until Herrera diffuses the situation by executing the soldier who has fired on the gang. The Bunch then elaborately hides their weapons haul - fifteen cases of rifles, plus a Browning M1917 machine gun - and gives it in installments to Mapache in exchange for their money. Unfortunately, when Angel and Dutch arrive in town, Mapache reveals that he has been tipped off by Teresa's father of Angel's perfidy -- for killing his daughter, the father revealed to Mapache that one of the cases of rifles was given to the rebels by Angel. Angel is captured by Mapache's men, and Dutch simply rides off.The gang regroups at a canyon outside of town, waiting for Sykes to return with their packhorses, and they argue over what to do. Then they watch as Sykes is ambushed and seriously wounded by Thornton's posse. Pike decides to abandon his old friend, who is being pursued hotly by Thornton's men, and return to Agua Verde to retrieve Angel. Mapache refuses to turn over Angel, who has been badly tortured, and invites the gang to spend the night in town whoring and drinking.The next morning, Pike decides to make a final stand. The four gang members load up shotguns, rifles, and semi-automatic sidearms and march through Agua Verde to Mapache's headquarters. After demanding Angel's release again, a drunken Mapache slits Angel's throat, and he is subsequently gunned down by Pike and Dutch. After a tense moment, the drunken Mexican soldiers under Mapache react, unsure of what to do. After a few seconds, Dutch looks at Pike and laughs, actually thinking that they might get away with killing Mapache over it being a justifiable killing. However, Pike is not amused. Apparently, he has already decided to die there. Pike takes deliberate aim at Captain Mohr, Mapache's adviser, and shoots him dead.At this point, a vicious, bloody gunfight (referred to as the ""Battle of the Bloody Porch"" by the film's crew) results as the Bunch shoots their way through Mapache's officers and seizes the machine gun. They inflict scores of casualties on the Mexican solders but finally fall due to the sheer number of their foe. Lyle and Tector are shot repeatedly as they try to man the machine gun; after being shot in the back by a Mexican prostitute (whom he kills afterwords) Pike is finally killed by a Mexican boy and other soldiers in a hail of bullets while manning the machine gun; Dutch is gunned down rushing to his side.After the battle, with Mapache's army nearly wiped out, Thornton and his surviving men ride into town and begin looting the dead bodies of the Mexican soldiers and their prey, while Thornton looks at his fallen colleagues in pity, taking Pike's unused revolver. Thornton declines to join the bounty hunters as they return to the United States, remaining at Agua Verde; they are ambushed and killed somewhere down the trail.In the final scene, Sykes, Don Jose, and a large group of Villista rebels later arrive at the town, and Thornton decides to join them.

Breaks in the plot representing the missing parts are given below with a double hyphen --]The film opens with the protagonist Encolpio, a student, who is furious with his room-mate Ascilto, who has run off with their boy-slave Gitone. Encolpio tracks down Ascilto to the baths, and during a fight Ascilto admits to having sold the boy to Vernacchio who runs a theatre. Encolpio goes to the theatre and challenges Vernacchio during a performance, and gets the boy back through the intervention of a magistrate who is attending the play.Encolpio and Gitone walk through the streets of Rome to go home. Seeing the magistrate has followed them and is beckoning to them, they dive into a brothel, and escape out of a back door, and then return to Encolpio's apartment. Ascilto returns too, and the two argue and decide to split up and divide their possessions. Gitone, allowed to choose who he goes with, chooses Ascilto. Only an earthquake saves Encolpio from committing suicide.--We find Encolpio in a museum, admiring the works. He bumps into an impoverished old man, Eumolpus, a poet, who is declaiming on the greatness of the classics and bemoaning the wretched state of modern art. Eumolpus takes Encolpio under his wing, and takes him to a feast at the villa of Tremalchio, a rich merchant despised by Eumolpus for his lack of culture. At the villa the guests are bathing before the meal, and Tremalchio seeing Eumolpus praises him as a colleague poet.The guests enter the villa for the meal. During the meal the poet Eumolpus and the host Trimalchio become steadily more drunk, and in the end have an argument when Eumolpus accuses Trimalchio of plagiarism. Trimalchio orders his slaves to throw Eumolpus in the furnace, and a fierce fight follows in the kitchens.Trimalchio gets morbid and takes his guests to the tomb where he will be buried when he dies. He bids everyone to act out his funeral. During the mock funeral a tale is told: a beautiful, newly-widowed woman decides to starve herself to death by her late husband's dead body in his tomb. A soldier who is guarding the bodies of recently executed prisoners, hears her wailing and goes to her. While they are together, the family of one of the executed takes his body, and when the soldier realises this he contemplates suicide as better than the punishment he will get. The widow however offers the body of her husband to hang up in the place of the criminal, to save the soldier's life.Walking home after the feast, Encolpio finds the battered but still living Eumolpus. He stays with him, and they fall asleep by a lake.--Encolpio awakes, and to his shock everything has changed. He has been taken prisoner by Lichas, a treasure seeker who collects beautiful things and people and takes them to the sickly young Caesar who lives exiled on an island. Encolpio is bundled on to a ship, and sees that Ascilto and Gitone have been captured too.During the voyage Lichas's eye falls on Encolpio, and marries him in a ceremony on the deck.Meanwhile, the young Caesar is overthrown. A marauding party boards Lichas's ship, and kills him.--A war follows as the new Caesar takes power.--We see a man and his wife whose property is to be confiscated by the new Caesar sending their children off to safety. He frees his slaves, and waves his children goodbye, telling them he will see them soon. He then commits suicide, telling his wife not to do the same.Later Ascilto and Encolpio creep onto the now-deserted property, and see the dead bodies of the man and his wife. They go into the house and explore, and discover a weeping slave girl. Seeing them she cheers up, and after a chase through the building, and a meal, the three spend the night together. They awake to the sound of burning.

During an overnight stop they are told that one of the travellers is going because his wife has been beset with nymphomania and he hopes the god will cure her. But in the meantime he will pay them well if they will go and satisfy the wife.--The temple is a centre of pilgrimage for sick people wishing to be cured. The following night a man persuades Ascilto and Encolpio to help him steal the demi-god. They kill his keepers, and run off pulling the boy in a cart. However, the child cannot cope with the heat of the sun out of doors, and the next night dies. The man blames Ascilto and Encolpio and a fight ensues where the man is killed.--Possibly as a result of the theft, Encolpio has been captured, and is thrown into the Minotaur's labyrinth.

                    In first century Rome, two student friends, Encolpio and Ascilto, argue about ownership of the boy Gitone, divide their belongings and split up. The boy, allowed to choose who he goes with, chooses Ascilto. Only a sudden earthquake saves Encolpio from suicide. We follow Encolpio through a series of adventures, where he is eventually reunited with Ascilto, and which culminates in them helping a man kidnap a hermaphrodite demi-god from a temple. The god dies, and as punishment Encolpio becomes impotent. We then follow them in search of a cure. The film is loosely based on the book Satyricon by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, the ""Arbiter of Elegance"" in the court of Nero. The book has only survived in fragments, and the film reflects this by being very fragmentary itself, even stopping in mid-sentence.

                    In the early days of Nazi Germany, a powerful noble family must adjust to life under the new dictatorship regime. The transition from democracy to dictatorship is thus dramatized through the lives of the family which also owns a powerful German industrial firm. Through such characters as a German Baron, a child molester, a Nazi Storm Trooper, an innocent man framed for murder, and a Captain in the German SS, ""Damned"" thus shows how so called ""German Upper Class Nobility"" first resented Adolf Hitler, then accepted him, and at last embraced him.

                    The battle of the sexes and relationships among the elite of Britain's industrial Midlands in the 1920s. Gerald Crich and Rupert Berkin are best friends who fall in love with a pair of sisters Gudrun, a sculptress and Ursula Brangwen, a schoolteacher. Rupert marries Ursula, Gerald begins a love affair with Gudrun, and the foursome embarks upon a Swiss honeymoon. But the relationships take markedly different directions, as Russell explores the nature of commitment and love. Rupert and Ursula learn to give themselves to each other; the more withdrawn Gerald cannot, finally, connect with the demanding and challenging Gudrun.

                    It's post-WWI in the Midlands. Gudrun and Ursula Brangwen are sisters from a working class family, both teachers, while Gudrun is also an artist. From a higher social standing, Rupert Birkin and Gerald Crich are best friends, Rupert a school inspector, Gerald a mining heir who currently manages the town's coal mine itself. In separate situations, each pair talks about their individual feelings concerning emotional love, marriage, the associated physical act of sex, and whether each of those three components can or should exist without the other two. The four individuals are all aware of the others, but are brought together into a more intimate situation when pretentious Hermione Roddice invites the Brangwen sisters to a weekend gathering at her country mansion, the gathering to which Rupert - her boyfriend - and Gerald are also invited. Hermione has ulterior motives in inviting the sisters, Gudrun who is more aware of that motive than Ursula. Regardless, from that weekend, Rupert and Ursula, and Gerald and Gudrun begin relationships with each other. All four are different in mentality, each requiring something different from their respective relationship. As such, each of the two couplings end up taking different paths. Based on those needs and wants, the question also arises if a partner or spouse can truly fulfill all the emotional needs - ""love"" - of the other being only one of two genders.

                    A liberated young schoolteacher at an Edinburgh girls' school in the period between the two wars, instructs her girls on the ways of life. Ignoring the more mundane subjects, she teaches them of love, politics and art. Her affairs with two male teachers become known and she finds herself fighting to keep her job. She believes that she can always count on the 100% support of her favourite pupils, but one of them does not feel that Miss Jean Brodie is in her ""prime"" any more. No longer swayed by her teacher's eloquence, she begins to learn about life and love herself.

                    Marcia Blaine is a conservative private girls' school in Edinburgh. Among its staff is flamboyant Jean Brodie, who has a romantic view of everything she experiences, including the politics of such leaders as Benito Mussolini and Francisco Franco. As she sees herself as a teacher first and foremost, she wants to impart as much of her self to her eleven and twelve year old students, but especially to her ""set"", those small group of girls who she finds special. She almost feels that she can preordain her students' futures, especially those of her set, and as such she has the loyalty of those girls. In the 1932/33 school year, when thirty-something Miss Brodie considers herself in the prime of her life and as such has more of her experience to impart, she has among her set: Sandy, the insightful one; Jenny, the pretty romantic; literary Monica; and timid, stuttering orphan Mary McGregor, who accepts the guidance of anyone who will provide it to her. Miss Brodie is at odds with most of the other staff, but especially the strict head mistress, Emmeline Mackay, not only because Miss Brodie does not teach the prescribed curriculum, but because of what Miss Mackay sees as Miss Brodie's improper attitude on life which she brings into her classroom. Miss Mackay's mission is to fire Miss Brodie, despite Miss Brodie having tenure. That year, Miss Brodie begins a relationship with the school's somewhat conservative music teacher, Gordon Lowther, although she is still attracted to the school's married art teacher, Teddy Lloyd, who she had an affair with and who still loves her. Her set are aware of what goes on in most of Miss Brodie's life as they spend most of their time with her, even Miss Brodie's weekends with Mr. Lowther at his seaside home in Cramond. They are however unaware of certain secrets, such as her affair with and continued attraction to Mr. Lloyd. Over the years of their life at Marcia Blaine, this specific set of girls will have a profound effect on Miss Brodie by their actions, even if she cannot or does not out of choice see those effects.

She has little time for the approved curriculum and rather teaches ""her girls"" her own romanticized, fantasist view of history, the arts and the world in general. She is a strong supporter of Mussolini and with the onset of the Spanish Civil War, Franco. She pushes her girls to excel in what she perceives to be their strengths: Monica will act in plays; Mary McGregor will overcome her stutter and make them all proud; Jenny will be painted many times and will be a great lover; and Sandy will use her intellect and and insight and be a great spy. Sandy realizes the dangerous game Miss Brodie is playing and after one of the other girls is killed, sets out to stop her.

                    In a mid-sized metropolis (population 500,000) in a right-wing military led country, a pacifist organization, which supports the opposition party in the government, is planning on holding an anti-military, nuclear disarmament rally. The organization's charismatic leader - the deputy - is scheduled to arrive in the town from the capital the day of the rally. Beyond the problems arranging the rally due to the probable incitement of violence at such a rally, the organization learns of an unconfirmed report that there will be an attempt on the deputy's life. The rally does happen, after which a three-wheeled kamikaze runs over the deputy, who eventually passes away from his injuries. The official report is that the incident was a drunken accident. In reality, the deputy's death was murder orchestrated by the secret police, the general for who likens the pacifist organization to mildew killing off agricultural crops. A magistrate is assigned to the case. Although he does have political views, he is more interested in finding out the truth, and as such has to wade through the political rhetoric and politically motivated testimony he hears. Thrown into the mix is a photojournalist who too is looking for the truth, as it, he believes, will make a great front page story.

                    King Henry VIII of England is contemplating what to do about his near 1,000 day union to his second wife, Anne Boleyn. The marriage has been controversial in that he, a devoutly religious man, had to break ties with the Catholic church in Rome so that he could divorce his first wife, Katherine of Aragon, who he married for political reasons. As such, many of his subjects consider his marriage to Anne as being not valid and Anne a whore. The marriage to Anne has also been tempestuous as Anne wanted to marry the young Lord Percy, with whom she was in love. But Anne eventually learned to love the power that being Queen of England would bring, a position which was fostered by her family, who could only see the benefit of such a union. The King's current contemplation of what to do stems from what he sees as Anne not fulfilling her end of the marriage in not producing a viable male heir to become the next King of England, she only bearing a daughter, Elizabeth, and a stillborn son. He sees Jane Seymour, one of Anne's ladies in waiting, as being a potential queen in her place. As much as Henry will do whatever in his power to get that desired male heir (his union to Katherine also produced only a daughter), Anne, who Henry professes to love, will do anything to ensure what she considers her and Elizabeth's rightful place within the monarchy.

                    The Dirty Dozen meet the Stiff Upper Lip. A British Petroleum executive (Michael Caine) is assigned to work with the British Army in North Africa handling port duties for incoming fuels. This gives him the official rank of Captain in the British Army. The Colonel (Nigel Green) in charge of the Dirty Dozen is told he must have a British officer accompany his men on a dangerous mission 400 miles behind the German lines and is saddled with the Petroleum executive, who tries to argue his way out by saying that his contract states he is to only work port duties. That argument is lost on the Brigade Commander (Harry Andrews) who simply points out that the executive is wearing a British uniform. The real leader of the Dirty Dozen (Nigel Davenport), a released prisoner himself, doesn't need or want the British officer, who's supposed to be in charge, but he's promised an extra 2,000 British Pounds if he gets him back alive. Disguised as Italians, their trek across Rommel's Africa includes meeting and battling many kinds of enemies and the plot twists at the end will keep your interest.

In Copenhagen, Denmark, a high-ranking Soviet intelligence officer defects to the West with his wife and daughter after a chase through the streets from the Soviet embassy to the US embassy. Upon arrival in Washington, DC, CIA agent Nordstrom (John Forsythe) debriefs him and learns that Russian missiles are to be posted in Cuba. Nordstrom enlists the aid of his friend and French agent André Devereaux (Frederick Stafford), encouraging him to accompany his daughter Michèle (Claude Jade) on her honeymoon with journalist François Picard (Michel Subor) as a premise to get him to New York. André accepts, but his wife Nicole (Dany Robin) is worried for him.In New York City, André entrusts a familiar contact, a Hatian immigrant and former French secret agent named Philippe Dubois (Roscoe Lee Browne), who currently runs a local flower shop in Harlem, to get hold of some seriously damaging papers concerning Soviet plans in Cuba from the visiting Cuban official Rico Parra (John Vernon playing a Fidel Castro-esq character). Parra is in New York to appear at the United Nations and stays at the Cuban consulate in Harlem to show solidarity with ""the masses"". Dubois, taking the identity of a black journalist from Ebony, sneaks into the embassy (which is seething with visitors and surrounded by an enthusiastic mob), manages to take photos of some of the documents and then runs away, chased by Cuban revolutionaries. While cunningly dodging away, Dubois shams bumping into and overthrowing André Devereaux, who was watching events from the other side of the street, and slips the camera into his hand. A Cuban guard helps André to get up, stares at him, and lets him go. Dubois manages to escape from his Cuban persuers and returns to his job at working in his flower shop.After examinting the photos, Devereaux confirms that the Soviets are secretly transporting and placing nuclear missiles in Cuba. Devereaux, unheeding of his wife's fear and jealousy, jets off to Cuba to find out more details. He catches up with his Cuban mistress Juanita de Cordoba (Karin Dor), widow to a former first-hour wealthy ""hero of the Revolution"", and herself now leader of the local underground resistance network: she acts undercover and collects information as Parra's lover. André, on arriving, finds Parra leaving Juanita's mansion. During a scene of intimacy in the mansion, Devereaux asks her to somehow take photos of the missiles as they are unloaded from Russian boats at the harbor. But Juanita's people are arrested and tortured, while Parra's man, during a big mass rally held during a lengthy speech of the ""leader màximo"" recognizes André's face from the incident in front of the hotel.Parra, who has heard from the maimed and tortured female underground member that Juanita is their leader, confronts Juanita and, hugging her in his arms, shoots her to save her from being tortured to death.In one of the film's most memorable shots, Juanita is seen from overhead, her dress spreading out on the floor like a bloodstain (although it is purple not red) on the big black-and-white pavement tiles, as she collapses.André is arrested is searched thoroughly at the Havana airport on departure, but the Cuban authorities are unable to find the carefully hidden microfilms, which provide crucial information for the CIA about Soviet activities in Cuba. André finds them hidden behind the cover of a book that Juanita gives him prior to leaving just before she is killed by Parra.At this point, the plot of the movie completely changes course. When André arrives back in Washington, he finds his home empty: his wife deserted him due to his Cuban love interest and returned to Paris. He is also recalled to Paris, but before he leaves, he is informed by Nordstrom about the existence of a Soviet spy organization called 'Topaz' within the French intelligence service. He is given the name of one certain member, NATO official Henri Jarré (Philippe Noiret), who leaked documents to the KGB.On arrival back in Paris, Andre attempts to get to the bottom of the leak, while his daughter Michèle wants to reconcile her parents. He invites some of his old friends and colleagues, including Jarré, to a lunch at a fine restaurant, ""Chez Pierre"". While Jarré eats, André tells the others about Topaz in order to provoke some reaction. Jarré answers that all this is a piece of misinformation, since he knows that the Russian official in fact died a year ago. But he begins to panic, and visits the man who is the leader of the spy ring, Jacques Granville (Michel Piccoli). But Granville, in his night gown, is ""waiting for somebody"". As Jarré is leaving Granville's house, a woman arrives. It is Nicole, André's wife, and as they kiss we see a photo on a stand: Devereaux, Nicole and Granville were old friends from their days together in the French Resistance...Devereaux sends his son-in-law François to interview and extract information out of Jarré. François calls Devereaux from Jarré's home, but the call is cut short. Devereaux and Michèle rush together to Jarré's flat, and find him dead having been thrown from his second floor window and landing on the roof of a parked car. François has disappeared.André and Michèle return to Nicole's, and a short time later François arrives: he was clubbed, but came to and managed to escape from his captors' car. He has overheard a phone number and shows a sketch of Jarré. Nicole, who was staring at the window then turns around and tells her family, with tearful eyes, that the phone number is Granville's, so he must be the leader of the ""Topaz"" organization.Devereaux goes to meet Agent Nordstrom and the Presidential entourage at Orly Airport, and to tell him about Granville. Nordstrom and company then tell the French they will brief them on the missiles in Cuba, but insist Granville not attend.The next morning, Devereaux and his wife, now obviously reconciled in mutual forgiveness, board a Pan Am flight back to Washington.

                    1962. While vacationing in Copenhagen, KGB official Boris Kusenov, his wife and their daughter are able to defect to the west with prearranged assistance from the US authorities, the operation led by CIA agent Mike Nordstrom, although the defection is not without incident. Kusenov, whose case file at the KGB was primarily NATO, is running away from the Soviets more than he is running toward western ideals, and as such is still reluctant to divulge any Soviet secrets. One of the things he does divulge to Nordstrom and the Americans is that the Soviets are building up military force in Cuba of an unknown nature. Nordstrom knows that the US cannot effectively work on this file because of the strained relationship between the US and Cuba that has thus far culminated with the Bay of Pigs incident. As such, Nordstrom asks his old friend, French intelligence agent André Devereaux whose cover is as a commercial attaché, to pursue this matter on the US's behalf, albeit without it being officially on the books as a French operation. Devereaux agrees if only because of his own intel as to Kusenov's defection, and further intel he is able to get from one of his Franco-American sources as to Cuba. It, however, places a strain on his marriage as it will eventually take him back to Cuba to work with Juanita de Cordoba, the widow of a hero of the Castro-led revolution, and now a lead figure in the anti-Castro underground. Devereaux's wife, Nicole, surmises correctly that Juanita is her husband's mistress, an accusation he denies. Beyond being able to get the necessary information in Cuba which places Devereaux, Juanita and her team's lives in danger, Devereaux may have further problems if Kusenov is forthright in his information on a covert operation code named Topaz.

Hoped to be a boon for their efforts battling the Cold War with Russia, the Americans soon find out that they have more to deal with than first thought, with Kusenov being less than cooperative, especially in regards to anything to do with a known leak in the French government, codenamed Topaz, which has seen top secret files leaked to those in Moscow. On discovering an agreement between the Russians and Cubans, agent Nordstrom enlists the aid of his friend, and French agent, Andre Devereaux who accompany at that time his daughter Michele at her honeymoon with journalist Francois Picard. André accepts, but his wife Nicole is worried for him. After managing to get hold of some seriously damning papers from the visiting Cuban official Rico Parra, sneakily of course, a concerned Devereaux jets off to Cuba and catches up with his mistress Juanita de Cordoba, who is now secretly involved with a local underground movement whilst also being involved in another way with Parra. He finds out and kills Juanita. Ever the jet setter, Devereaux is now off home to Paris to get to the bottom of this whole leak problem. Michele wants to reconcile her parents.

Further, he tells that the French NATO representative Henri Jarre is the second in the chain of command of the spy ring Topaz, leaking classified information to the soviets, and the head of spies in known only by the codename of Columbine.

It will be a miracle if any of them can escape from the wrath of old Chief's destructive spirit and get out of the Canyon alive.I remember seeing Ted Cassidy, aka ""Lurch"" from the ""The Addams Family"", playing the role of one of the Native American Indians in the film.

                    Toni Simmons believes that the only reason her married lover won't leave his wife is because of the children. In truth, her lover, dentist Julian Winston, doesn't have any children. In fact, Julian doesn't even have a wife - he just tells women he does to avoid getting involved. When Julian does decide to take the plunge with Toni she insists on meeting the first wife and Julian enlists the aid of his long-time nurse/receptionist Stephanie Dickinson to play the part.

                    Twenty-one year old Toni Simmons and middle aged married dentist Dr. Julian Winston are in love with each other. Toni values honesty above all else, but their relationship is based on a lie: Julian is not married. He initially told her this lie as not to make a long term commitment to her, but he now wants to marry her as she wants to marry him. Because she values honesty above all else, he feels he can't now tell her he's not married. And because she doesn't want to be a home-wrecker, Toni wants to meet the current Mrs. Dr. Winston to ensure their marriage is indeed over. So Julian asks his efficient, no-nonsense, loyal and devoted nurse/receptionist Stephanie Dickinson to pose as his wife. In Julian's mind, Stephanie is the logical choice as she already does many of his chores he considers wifely. Stephanie, a middle aged spinster who hides any aspect of her femininity, reluctantly agrees to the ruse. Toni has more questions about her own relationship with Julian after meeting Stephanie than are answered. But in posing as Mrs. Dr. Winston, Stephanie begins to bloom much like the cactus plant on her desk. Conversely, Toni's next door neighbor, writer Igor Sullivan, has his own thoughts about what Toni should do with her life.

On the first anniversary of his relationship with his twenty-one year-old mistress Toni Simmons, he does not visit her since he dates an Austraian steward. Toni believes Julian is married with three children and stayed with his family; therefore she decides to commit suicide with gas. However her next door neighbor, the young aspiring writer Igor Sullivan, saves her life. When Julian learns what Toni did, he decides to marry her. However Toni does not want to be a homewrecker and asks to talk to Mrs. Winston to be sure that she wants the divorce. Julian does not want her to know that he is a liar, so he asks Stephanie to pose of Mrs. Winston, in the beginning of lots of confusions and misunderstandings.

                    The life of Virgil Starkwell, still a young man, is presented, that presentation partly through interviews with family and acquaintances. He has been in and out of prison since he was in his mid-twenties, primarily for armed robberies. His down and out life was largely predetermined having grown up in the slums of New York City, and never having fit in anywhere in society, being shunned if not bullied. His life of crime began as a means of survival since he was inept at everything else, which is not to say that he is also inept as a robber, hence the reason he has been caught so easily time after time. His life has the potential to change when he meets and falls in love with Louise, a laundress. Louise is also somewhat of an outsider in society, she having grown up in a dysfunctional household with a strict military father and alcoholic mother. As Virgil and Louise try to eke out a life together, the fact of Louise in his life will either make Virgil turn to a life of the straight and narrow, or conversely do anything required to support her.

    Synopsis
    A frontier town in the Old West springs up almost literally overnight when the rather klutzy and hotheaded Prudy Perkins discovers gold in a grave during a funeral. Her father Olly becomes mayor of the new settlement. He and the other members of the town council bemoan the twin facts that the place has become a drunken round-the-clock free-for-all, and that in order to ship out all the gold they are mining, they must pay a hefty fee to the Danbys, a family of ranchers/bandits who control the only route out of town. Most people are too busy digging to take time out to be sheriff, and those who are willing to put down their shovel quickly die.This all changes with the arrival in town of Jason McCullough, a calm and hyper-competent man from ""back East"" who is passing through town ""on his way to Australia.""

In a motel room where Natalie stops to rest during the day, she sits motionless on the bed, and experiences the exuberance of complete freedom and the queasy feelings of new beginnings. Natalie continues on with her journey and picks up a young hitch-hiker named Killer, an attractive brain-damaged football player. It is through Killer that a more disturbing question is posed to Natalie than that of domestic responsibility. How deeply are we wedded to chance meetings and are we responsible for the crimes that we witness?

Feeling trapped in her circumstances, she decides to run away to California to get as far away from her life as possible, although she, in a series of telephone calls back to her husband Vinny, is up front about what she believes she is feeling. This escape could be temporary, maybe permanent, she doesn't really know. On her drive, she picks a young, handsome hitchhiker who she learns is Jimmy ""Killer"" Kilgannon, the nickname gained as a former star college football player. Her sole purpose in picking him up is to have a one-night stand, so that she can emotionally escape further from her life with Vinny. When she tries to drop him off at the home of one of his former girlfriends named Ellen Brook, Natalie further learns that Killer's simple ways are because he is mentally disabled from a head injury sustained in a football game. The college paid him off to leave, Ellen has no interest in him in his mental state, and he has no family. Natalie herself becomes conflicted about helping him when she feels she can barely help herself. Among the many encounters Natalie has that affects her feelings about her life and about Killer, one with a Nebraska highway patrolman named Gordon provides her with the clearest picture, although it may come at a price.

                    The Illustrated Man is classic Bradbury, a collection of eighteen startling visions of humankind's destiny, unfolding across a canvas of decorated skin, visions as keen as the tattooist's needle and as colorful as the inks that indelibly stain the body. The images, ideas, sounds and scents that abound in this phantasmagoric sideshow are provocative and powerful: the mournful cries of celestial travelers cast out cruelly into a vast space of stars and blackness, the sight of gray dust settling over a forgotten outpost on a road that leads nowhere, the pungent odor of Jupiter on a returning father's clothing. Here living cities take their vengeance, technology awakens the most primal natural instincts, Martian invasions are foiled by the good life and the glad hand, and dreams are carried aloft in junkyard rockets.

                    Just as the original book is an anthology of science fiction stories, the Illustrated Man movie has a framing device to connect the fragmented story vignettes that are told. A young hobo falls in with an experienced traveler who at times frightens and entices him. The senior hobo(Rod Stieger) is covered from head to toe by tattoo illustrations that both enrich and curse him. He warns the young man not to stare too closely at them for too long, as they seem to come alive and portray tales. Each one in turn plays out a science fiction tale, a morality play, some bitter, some sweet, some perplexing. The movie reuses the same three principal actors in every story vignette, making it a bizarre, confusing task to try to re-identify each as their role changes from tale to tale. There is no connecting thread here, save for the continuing framing story of the young man becoming entranced by the illustrations. The older hobo claims he is searching for the woman who tattooed him to this extent, but it is unclear if she is real, a phantom, or an invention of his somewhat disturbed mind. By the time we get the entire tale of how the tattoos came to be, Rod has become romantically involved with the female tattoo artist. There is some suggestion that she has made a mark upon his soul by living with him for so long. But suddenly, she is gone, vanished, and he is forever searching for his lost love, his muse, his devil woman who has cursed him to live like this and thrown him to the hard, cruel world. Shocked and driven to the point of madness himself, the young man attempts to crush the old hobo's skull with a rock, and then flees himself, having now become the target of the old hobo's pursuit. There is no resolution to this, only an endless chase that continues...

John has to walk a fine line in his work, especially in this day and age of increasing public disenfranchisement due to anti-establishment feelings, with frequent civil rights protests, anti-war protests or other civil unrest taking place. In what are already confrontational situations, John and Gus' involvement adds yet another layer of possible confrontation. Although by the very nature of their work they are supposed to be neutral in the situation, they also have to decide when not to be neutral, in when it is more appropriate to be involved for the greater good of those in the situation. It is in one such of these moral questions that John comes to loggerheads with his superiors. At this time, John also puts aside his largely ""sexually free"" casual relationship with a nurse named Ruth to begin a more serious relationship with Eileen Horton, a recent arrival to Chicago from rural West Virginia. Their relationship is despite what could have been their very antagonistic initial meeting over an issue concerning her thirteen year old son, Harold, who largely has a mind of his own. Two concurrent items - John filming the 1968 Democratic National Convention and Harold going missing - bring the professional issues in John's life to a head in a global sense.

                    After spending several months in an orbiting lab, three astronauts prepare to return to earth only to find their rockets wont fire. After initially thinking they might have to abandon them in orbit, NASA decides to launch a daring rescue. Their plans are complicated by a hurricane headed towards the launch site and a shrinking air supply in the astronauts capsule.

                    After a crew of three astronauts spend five of a planned seven months working in an orbiting space lab, the three astronauts - Jim Pruitt, Clayton Stone and Buzz Lloyd - are ordered to return to Earth by the head of the program, Charles Keith. They soon find however that their retro-rockets will not fire and they are unable to return. With only 42 hours of oxygen remaining, Keith and many others at NASA try to find a solution to get them back alive. With few options available, Ted Dougherty proposes a rescue mission using an experimental spacecraft that has yet to be rated for manned flight. To make matters worse, a hurricane is approaching the launch site. Faced with insufficient oxygen for all three of them, the astronauts face the ultimate decision. For those who survive, help comes from an unexpected source.

                    Jim Pruett, Clayton Stone and Buzz Lloyd are the three astronauts aboard the Apollo spacecraft Ironman One, which is on a seven month mission to the space lab Saturn 4B (S4B). Due to what looks to be space fatigue, Charles Keith, chief of the space mission at NASA, protracts this mission at the five month stage. After separating Ironman One from the S4B, the astronauts find that their booster engines are not firing, literally meaning that they are stranded in space, with enough oxygen in Ironman One for the three of them for a little less than two days. Those in mission control have to decide whether to risk sending a rescue team which logistically would be a near impossibility to get everything organized to reach Ironman One within that time. Keith and Ted Dougherty, the chief astronaut, are on opposite sides of the argument, with the President ultimately falling on Dougherty's side to launch a rescue mission despite the odds. Dougherty will lead that rescue attempt. Something that reduces the odds even more is that the first hurricane of the Atlantic season has shifted course and is heading toward the Florida coast, Cape Canaveral the only location where there is even a rocket remotely ready to go. While Pruett, Stone and Lloyd's respective wives need to remain stoic both in public and in communicating to their husbands, the three aboard Ironman One have to decide which orders to follow. Most specifically, the three want to try and repair the boosters, not knowing exactly what is wrong with them, while those at mission control have ordered them to remain as inactive as possible to reserve their oxygen supply.

                    Womanizing Brit Charlie Cartwright is about to conduct Worldwind Tour #225, a nine country, eighteen day bus trip from London to Rome. He uses these tours in large part to catch up with his vast stable of casual girlfriends located in each of the visited cities. Within the group of disparate Americans on this tour, most who have never been to Europe, and the reason for them taking this trip are: parents who want to get their hormone driven teen-aged daughter away from her boyfriend despite the fact that the father doesn't want to leave the familiarity of home; a not-so woman's man who wants to prove to his friends that he had a beautiful woman in every country; an ethnic non-Italian speaking Italian who wants to catch up with the relatives he's never met; a WWII veteran who wants to re-experience the best times he's ever had; and a man who solely wants ""free"" souvenirs. But the one Charlie is most interested in is pretty Samantha Perkins, a self-confessed straight-laced woman who wants to experience life in a faraway land while she contemplates the marriage proposal of her boyfriend, George. As the group gets into one adventure and misadventure after another - including one person catching the wrong bus, the Italian having family connections he wished he hadn't while missing the one he wished he had, and the daughter sneaking off with a young American on a protest tour - Charlie does his best to woo Sam, who, despite her inexperience, seems to know Charlie's ploy. But Sam has to figure out where Charlie and or George will fit into her future if at all, and Charlie has to decide if he will ever grow up.

Lucy asks both Charlie Brown and Linus what they see. Linus' views are incredibly detailed, making Charlie Brown feel inferior that he is only able to see a 'ducky' and a 'horsie' in the clouds.Sometime afterward, Charlie Brown attempts to construct a kite and fly it. His first attempt gets destroyed by a heavy wind before he even gets off the porch. His second attempt manages to get aloft, but not before dragging him everywhere, before the kite crashes to the ground. Angered at his kite, he thrusts it at Lucy, saying 'anyone who can fly this kite is a genius.' Lucy tosses it to Snoopy...who manages to get the kite flying with no problem, much to Charlie's irritation.Eventually, the baseball season starts, and Charlie is eager for the first game of the season. After first having to contend with his pitcher's mound being covered with dandelions, the groups ends up losing the first game of the season. Charlie dejectedly goes home. In the bathtub, he remarks over his inability to do anything right. As if to add insult to injury, a toy boat he attempts to sail in the tub, sinks to the bottom.The next day, Linus visits Charlie Brown, and they play tic-tac-toe in the sand on Charlie Brown's front porch. While Charlie laments about his losing streak, Linus tries to put a positive spin on it. ""We learn more from losing, than we do from winning,"" he replies. ""I guess that makes me the smartest person in the whole world,"" says Charlie, being sarcastic. This causes Linus to admit that if Charlie Brown stays positive, he'll win one of these days. However, just as he says this, Linus ends up winning the tic-tac-toe game.Still unsure what to do, Charlie goes to Lucy's psychiatry booth, seeking 'professional help.' Lucy ends up showing Charlie's many faults in a slideshow. The experience makes him nauseous, and he begs for the 'therapy' to stop. Lucy then attempts to have Charlie Brown kick a football, but once again, she pulls it away, and then plans to use a video camera's instant replay of the event, to analyze him even further. This just makes Charlie even more dejected, with Lucy adding with a smile, 'wait until you get my bill.'Going to school the next day with Linus, the two are informed of a spelling bee at the school. When Linus suggests to Charlie that he should enter, Lucy, Patty, and Violet begin making fun of him, saying he'll make a fool of himself.Eventually, Charlie enters, and becomes the winner in his class. With the all-school spelling bee the next day, he and Linus go home and study the dictionary. However, the next day, Charlie's head is a jumble of words.Even so, he manages to win for the school, and the kids cheer him on, as he heads home. As Charlie attempts to relax, the others tell him that his winning for the school, means he qualifies for the 'National Eliminations Spelling Bee.' Charlie then goes back to studying, but confides in Linus that he feels he'll make a fool of himself.Some time later, Charlie is sent off by bus to the Spelling Bee. Linus is so overcome with emotion, that he gives Charlie Brown his blanket for luck, before the bus departs for New York City.This plan backfires on Linus, who begins to experience withdrawal symptoms without his blanket. Talking to Snoopy, he convinces him to come with him to find Charlie Brown and get his blanket back.After showing up at Charlie's hotel room, Charlie explains that he is not sure where Linus' blanket is, but assumes he may have left it at the library.Both Linus and Snoopy wander out into the city to look for the blanket. Snoopy is eventually distracted by the ice rink at Rockefeller Center, and skates around the ice, even pretending to be embroiled in a hockey game.Linus makes it to the public library, but peering inside, sees nothing. After he finds Snoopy, he angrily returns to Charlie Brown's hotel room, only to find Charlie struggling to stay awake after studying hard for the Spelling Bee a few hours away.As Linus struggles to keep himself going, he sees Charlie shining his shoes...with his blanket! Linus quickly snatches up the blanket, and appears to be just fine.The three then head to the competition, with Linus and Snoopy watching in the front row, and the other kids watching on television at home.As the competition continues on, it comes down to Charlie Brown and one other kid. The two are locked in a heated competition, until Charlie Brown is given the word 'beagle.' Unfortunately, Charlie trips up, and spells it b-e-a-g-e-l.Charlie sadly leaves the competition with his head hung low, and is silent for the rest of the day, even during the group's trip back home.The day after they get back, Linus stops by to see Charlie, who is laying in bed with the shades pulled down. Linus claims the kids at school missed him, but Charlie says he isn't going back to school. Linus even mentions that they had a ballgame after school, but this still doesn't relieve Charlie Brown from his morose mood, which gets a little more morose when he hears the team won.As Linus leaves, he notes that his friend seems down because he feels he let the others down, and made a fool of himself.""But did you notice something, Charlie Brown?"" asks Linus.""What's that?"" says Charlie Brown.""The world didn't come to an end,"" replies Linus, who closes the door.These words seem to work on Charlie, who gets up, gets dressed, and walks outside. The world does seem to be going on just as normal. In a clearing, Charlie notices Lucy, sitting around with a football. As she seems to put it in a placekick position, he attempts to sneak up behind her and kick it, but she pulls it away from him at the last second, sending him sprawling on the ground.As he lays there, she comes up to him and welcomes him home.","
    
                    Poor Charlie Brown. He can't fly a kite, and he always loses in baseball. Having his faults projected onto a screen by Lucy doesn't help him much either. Against the sage advice and taunting of the girls in his class, he volunteers for the class spelling bee...and wins! Next, it's the school spelling bee. Once again, a winner! Good grief! Now the pressure is on as he is off to New York City for the televised national spelling bee.

Talking to Snoopy, he convinces him to come with him to find Charlie Brown and get his blanket back.After showing up at Charlie's hotel room, Charlie explains that he is not sure where Linus' blanket is, but assumes he may have left it at the library.Both Linus and Snoopy wander out into the city to look for the blanket. Snoopy is eventually distracted by the ice rink at Rockefeller Center, and skates around the ice, even pretending to be embroiled in a hockey game.Linus makes it to the public library, but peering inside, sees nothing. After he finds Snoopy, he angrily returns to Charlie Brown's hotel room, only to find Charlie struggling to stay awake after studying hard for the Spelling Bee a few hours away.As Linus struggles to keep himself going, he sees Charlie shining his shoes...with his blanket! Linus quickly snatches up the blanket, and appears to be just fine.The three then head to the competition, with Linus and Snoopy watching in the front row, and the other kids watching on television at home.As the competition continues on, it comes down to Charlie Brown and one other kid. The two are locked in a heated competition, until Charlie Brown is given the word 'beagle.' Unfortunately, Charlie trips up, and spells it b-e-a-g-e-l.Charlie sadly leaves the competition with his head hung low, and is silent for the rest of the day, even during the group's trip back home.The day after they get back, Linus stops by to see Charlie, who is laying in bed with the shades pulled down. Linus claims the kids at school missed him, but Charlie says he isn't going back to school. Linus even mentions that they had a ballgame after school, but this still doesn't relieve Charlie Brown from his morose mood, which gets a little more morose when he hears the team won.As Linus leaves, he notes that his friend seems down because he feels he let the others down, and made a fool of himself.""But did you notice something, Charlie Brown?"" asks Linus.""What's that?"" says Charlie Brown.""The world didn't come to an end,"" replies Linus, who closes the door.These words seem to work on Charlie, who gets up, gets dressed, and walks outside. The world does seem to be going on just as normal. In a clearing, Charlie notices Lucy, sitting around with a football. As she seems to put it in a placekick position, he attempts to sneak up behind her and kick it, but she pulls it away from him at the last second, sending him sprawling on the ground.As he lays there, she comes up to him and welcomes him home.

One day as Eddie is driving to work, he is involved in a major car accident, which could have easily taken his life, but which lands him in hospital with non-life threatening injuries. What only his faithful wife, Florence Anderson, suspects is that Eddie himself caused the accident in an effort to commit suicide. She is only partly correct as Eddie subconsciously changed his mind at the last split second to avoid being killed in the accident. Eddie and Florence have a rather clinical relationship, Florence realizing that he is going through issues, about which he doesn't talk. One of the manifestations of those issues is that he embarked on an affair that Florence is well aware of with a younger woman named Gwen, who worked at the ad agency and who Florence refers to as the office tramp. Florence is not far off the mark as Gwen was hired primarily in that role for whatever purpose required. Gwen ultimately moved on without Eddie, after she realized that he was not going to leave Florence. Gwen now lives in New York. Florence just wants to help Eddie deal with whatever issues he is facing so that they can move on with their lives together in a positive manner. During his physical and emotional recuperation, Eddie is called to New York to deal with his ailing abusive father, Sam Arness. Eddie's relationship with Sam and the lure to see Gwen while in New York affect what happens in Eddie's life in a holistic sense.

    Synopsis
    In 1905, a train rolls into a quiet and happy Mississippi town where Lucius (Mitch Vogell), a boy of 11, is about to begin his journey to manhood as his grandfather, Boss (Will Geer) has the town's first car delivered, a yellow Winton Flier. The family's handyman, Boon Hogganbeck (Steve McQueen), immediately takes the automobile under his eager care. His friend Ned (Rupert Crosse) steals it to try to impress a woman resulting in a fun chase and ending in an innocent accident.
Lucius' other grandfather dies requiring the family's attendance out of town. Boss leaves the young boy in the care of Boon - after cautious warnings of Boon's predilections of immoral tendencies. Boon immediately teaches Lucious how to smoke, drive and lie to his other relatives so he can go on the road trip.
Boon talks of the benefits and beauty of a trip to Memphis and as they start Ned talks his way aboard.
Their first hazard passed, a muddy ditch where they pay for the assistance of mules to free them, they make it to the big highway a two-lane dirt road. They make it to their first stop a Memphis brothel where Boons girlfriend Corrie (Sharon Farell) works piquing Lucius pubescent curiosities. After Lucius gets into a manly brawl with another youngster regarding the reality of Corrie's adult profession, she is determined to change her path and quits to join Boon and the boys on the road.
That same night, Ned drunkenly trades the automobile for a questionable racehorse leaving them all without transportation a racehorse that doesn't race.
In order to figure out how to get the horse to run they regroup at Mr. Possums (Juano Hernandez) farm, a black man who's mortal enemy Sherriff Lovemaiden (Clifton James) threatens racial calamity. Some of the ladies of the evening and other friends hear about the race and show up from Memphis to root for the cause. Lovemaiden comes back with his deputies and after a barnyard brawl he arrests the lot.Corrie arranges for their release with a private liaison with Lovemaiden causing Boon to give her a black eye. Lucius, abhorred by the realities of adulthood wants to quit and go home but after considering what his grandfather would do decides he will finish the task.
Lucius will be the jockey and if they win they can get the car back. After the first race ends with controversy he wins the second race. Grandfather Boss shows up after witnessing the win and the return of the car.
Lucius, Boon, Ned, Corrie and Boss go back to Mississippi.
In lieu of corporal punishment from his father, Boss interrupts with and opportunity for Lucius to learn the valuable life lesson of accepting responsibility for ones actions regardless of cause - a large lesson indeed.

                    A movie about the First World War based on a stage musical of the same name, portraying the ""Game of War"" and focusing mainly on the members of the Smith family who go off to war. Much of the action in the movie revolves around the words of the marching songs of the soldiers, and many scenes portray some of the more famous (and infamous) incidents of the war, including the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, the Christmas meeting between British and German soldiers in no-man's-land, and the wiping out by their own side of a force of Irish soldiers newly arrived at the front, after successfully capturing a ridge that had been contested for some time.

Breckenridge took over managing it following her father's passing, but it is doing poor business and threatens to close because of it. When the show is in a town south of the Rio Grande, T.J. receives a surprise visit from Tuck Kirby, who used to be with the show and was her former fiancé, until he walked out on her and the show out of fear of commitment. Now a horse trader, Tuck, who is still attracted to T.J., wants to buy the show's star horse for Wild Bill's show, but also to help get T.J. out of a financial hole. But T.J. has a new attraction which she believes will get the show out of trouble: ""El Diablo"", a miniature horse the size of an average dog. In his recent encounters with a paleontologist named Horace Bromley, Tuck knows that El Diablo is an eohippus, a prehistoric creature long believed to be extinct. Professor Bromley had found a fossilized footprint of an eohippus in the area. The local gypsies, led by Tia Zorina, believe that stealing the creature from a place called the Forbidden Valley, is a curse and must be returned. Knowledge of El Diablo's existence within this small group leads to the different parties trying to get their hands on the creature. But Tuck, his young orphaned local guide Lope, T.J. and her associates, and Professor Bromley discovering the location of the Forbidden Valley changes the focus to what they consider bigger prizes to be found there. However, in wanting to get the biggest prize out of the valley alive for the world to see may open up a proverbial can of worms they may have ultimately wished remained closed.

I've seen this one many times and enjoy it every time. Robert Redford did all his own skiing for this and must be especially fond and proud of this particular film.The character Redford plays, David Chappellet, is a very bleak and grimly determined individual (Remember Bruno in The Blue Max?) When David goes home to visit his father we see where he got his emotional approach to living. Their conversations are so minimalist as to be nearly autistic. From their viewpoint probably just seen as practical minded and verbally economical. But I don't care what anybody says. There was something I liked about this character and found myself rooting for him. I was happy when he won at the end. What else would there have been to this story if he hadn't won?

His roommate sums up his goals when he observes of David, ""He's not for the team, and he never will be""; but precisely who the David is that David is so fiendishly striving for we're never to learn. He develops a short-lived relationship with Carole Stahl, a glamorous European woman even more capricious than himself. Chappellet's identity trouble are exacerbated by the fact that he is an ""Event"" as well as a personality; and more astute minds than his own have difficulty where the one leaves off and the other takes over. Director Michael Richie's (""The Candidate"") feature film debut.

                    From the small rural community of Idaho Springs, Colorado, Dave Chappellet has just joined the US men's downhill ski team, which has little respect from the traditional powerhouses from Europe as the US only has one seeded skier, Johnny Creech. Dave believes the team's head coach, Claire, is not looking after his best interest, such as not fighting to get him higher start numbers in races. Regardless of this and other external obstacles which Dave believes are the only things between him and the podium, he is able to achieve skiing success which leads to eventually being among that first seed with Johnny. Although Dave does ultimately win races, he DNF just as many, as he has an all or nothing approach. Conversely, Claire has a love/hate relationship with Dave, who he knows is talented and winning races will ultimately bring in much needed funding to the team as a whole, but his self-absorbed and arrogant attitude has alienated himself from the rest of the team and created team disharmony. Dave's attitude is borne out of his distant relationship with his farmer father, who does not understand why Dave is not pursuing a paying job, and an inferiority complex growing up without money like his teammates. That arrogance is also demonstrated in his personal life, in how he treats Lena, his girl back home, and how he pursues Carole Stahl, an employee of ski manufacturer Machet, who is wooing the American ski team to use his skis. Two years in Dave's journey is shown, chasing the ultimate prize of the gold medal in the men's downhill at the next Olympics.

    Synopsis
    Comments by Actor / Writer Roy C. PetersonThis is a skier's movie. I only wish there were more ski movies. I've seen this one many times and enjoy it every time. Robert Redford did all his own skiing for this and must be especially fond and proud of this particular film.The character Redford plays, David Chappellet, is a very bleak and grimly determined individual (Remember Bruno in The Blue Max?) When David goes home to visit his father we see where he got his emotional approach to living. Their conversations are so minimalist as to be nearly autistic. From their viewpoint probably just seen as practical minded and verbally economical. But I don't care what anybody says. There was something I liked about this character and found myself rooting for him. I was happy when he won at the end. What else would there have been to this story if he hadn't won? To love your work and to never betray it, whatever else happens, is one of the greatest gifts that life can give.

                    Late teens Sandy, Peter and Dan meet while their respective families vacation for the summer on Fire Island, New York. They instantly bond - initially over the rescue of an injured seagull - with the three entering into a friendship where they do everything together in solidarity with little respect for others, especially the adult figures in their life. They almost become indistinguishable as individuals when together, such as being in a gang. Things change when they meet another vacationing teen named Rhoda later in the summer. Rhoda is shy, seemingly insecure (which the three later learn for good reason), overly analytical and straight-laced, but she needs the acceptance of her peers. Then, the individual personalities of the three friends begins to emerge, Peter being the sensitive one, Dan the overly confident one who may not have reason to be, and Sandy the manipulative one, especially in using her sexuality to control the two males. But Rhoda, in asserting her own beliefs, may not have a chance when dealing with the three as a group.
