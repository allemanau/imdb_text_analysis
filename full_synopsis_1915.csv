                    Two brothers, Phil and Ted Stoneman, visit their friends in Piedmont, South Carolina: the family Cameron. This friendship is affected by the Civil War, as the Stonemans and the Camerons must join up opposite armies. The consequences of the War in their lives are shown in connection to major historical events, like the development of the Civil War itself, Lincoln's assassination, and the birth of the Ku Klux Klan.

                    In 1860, the Stoneman and Cameron families are part of the aristocracy, Austin Stoneman a powerful U.S. Congressman, the Cameron father a respected physician. The Stonemans live in the Pennsylvania countryside when Austin is not in Washington, while the Camerons live in Piedmont, South Carolina. Phil Stoneman and Ben Cameron, the eldest son of each respective family, are old school chums. When Phil and his younger brother Tod Stoneman visit Ben in Piedmont, Phil falls in love with Ben's eldest sister, Margaret Cameron, while Ben falls in love with the Stoneman's only sister, Elsie Stoneman, after only seeing her photograph. The Stoneman brothers' trip is cut short with the start of the Civil War. Despite being on opposing sides, the Stonemans and Camerons' friendship is not diminished, even in direct battles, which results in casualties in both families. Following the war and the assassination of President Lincoln, Austin, in a position of greater power and wanting to advance the cause of the blacks, appoints biracial Silas Lynch to rally the black vote in the south. This move is followed by the Stonemans' move to Piedmont, a more favorable climate for Austin's failing health. The move strengthens the romances between Phil and Margaret, and between Elsie and Ben. But Lynch, also based in Piedmont, has other things on his mind. An incident between a renegade black man named Gus and the Camerons' youngest daughter, Flora Cameron, begins an uprising of the Ku Klux Klan to protect the dwindling white power. The Camerons' support of the Clan threatens Elsie and Ben's relationship until...

                    D.W. Griffith's epic tale of the American civil war, told primarily from the perspective of the South. The story is nominally that of two families, one from the north, the other the south, and the challenges they face during the war. Heavily slanted in favor of the Confederates, who are noble and right, against the Yankees who are degenerate and without scruples. When black Union troops take over the town of Piedmont, South Carolina the Ku Klux Klan becomes the white population's saviors.

When his infatuation leads him to kill a fellow guardsman in order to prevent her arrest, he becomes a wanted fugitive.

                    Carmen is a half-wild, fascinating creature, a gypsy by birth, and living with a band of smugglers in the mountains near the coast of Spain. The smugglers are foiled in their attempt to get their illegal goods into the little town by Don Jose, an officer in the regiment stationed there. Carmen is sent by Pastia, the leader of the smugglers and the local tavern keeper, to fascinate Don Jose and make him forget his duties and give the smugglers an opportunity to bring their goods into the city. Carmen secures work in a tobacco factory near the city wall, to account for her presence near Don Jose, and it is also announced that she will dance at the tavern in the evenings. The night Carmen dances in the tavern, she is the center of attraction. She is wooed unsuccessfully by Morales, a brother officer of Don Jose's, and also by Escamillo, a young toreador on his way to Seville to enter the bullring there. Escamillo has loved Carmen for a long time, but she, while attracted to him, has clung to her liberty. Escamillo asks Carmen to accompany him to Seville, and she is tempted to listen to him, but Pastia reminds her that her beauty is at present for Don Jose and she must carry through their plans. Don Jose, after Carmen's wild, sensuous dance, loses his heart to her, and that night when she passes by the breach in the wall where he is on guard, he follows her off while the smugglers enter the city. The following morning Carmen gets into an altercation at the tobacco factory and cuts one of the girls after a fight in which the whole factory is involved. The soldiers are called, and Don Jose and some of his men arrest Carmen and start to lead her away. As they pass the tavern, Carmen persuades Jose to let her have a word with Pastia before she goes to prison, and Jose, leaving the soldiers outside, accompanies her in the tavern. Morales, who is drinking, makes some insulting remarks to Jose, and the two men fight. Jose, aided by Carmen, manages to kill Morales, and Carmen escapes through the window and starts for the mountains, followed shortly after by Jose, whom the smugglers have taken under their protection. Carmen sends for Escamillo, and decides to accompany him to Seville. Escamillo and Carmen arrive in Seville the day of the great bullfight. They are the center of all eyes. The young Toreador enters the bull ring, and instantly receives the favor of the crowd by his bravery. Jose, however, has followed the two to the arena. One of the smugglers warns Carmen that Jose is waiting for her, but she, fearless as ever, goes to confront him and tell him plainly that she does not care for him and that she has cast her lot with Escamillo. Maddened by her refusal of his love after she has led him to do so much for her and overcome with jealousy, Jose kills her. She dies at the gates of the arena, as the crowd proclaims Escamillos' victory.

                    Grinde is a junior partner of a pottery firm. An old chemist, Benjamin Lord, discovers a formula for glazing pottery that is designed to revolutionize the industry. The chemist's grandson, David, takes a sample of the new process to Grinde, who says he will give it consideration. He delegates his foreman, Mole, to steal the formula. Mole kills the chemist, and he and Grinde frame an explosion to conceal the crime. After David refuses to sell the formula, Grinde and Mole lock him and his sweetheart in a vault with poisonous gas. Grinde then tries to kill Mole, who knows too much, and take over the firm from his elderly partner at a directors' meeting.

                    Young Romance, released in 1915, is a recent rediscovery that forever silences the claim that refined comedy cannot be conveyed via the screen. This disguise plot, worthy of an Elizabethan drama, was written by William deMille (brother of Cecil, father of Agnes), and directed by George Melford (""The Sheik,"" the Spanish ""Dracula"").

                    Nellie Nolan works at the notions counter of a big department store, and Tom Clancy is in the hardware department of the same establishment. But both of their souls are filled with ambitions and aspirations not to be governed by even the routine of such existence. Nellie has saved a whole hundred dollars and, in a fit of June madness, decides to spend it all for one week of glorious pretense at a Maine summer resort, assuming the role of a lady of fashion and tasting for once the joys of wealth. Tom is impressed with the same newspaper story which has caught Nellie's eye, and he goes to the same resort, posing as a rich young man from Newport. The two young people meet each other, each believing the other belongs to an entirely different sphere of life, and the succeeding events make it possible for Tom to become a hero in the eyes of the girl by rescuing her from a desolate island. They fall in love, but an understanding is impossible because they both are unwilling to confess that they are not what they seem. They both return to the store, and that very day Tom is transferred to the counter directly opposite where Nellie deals in notions. Thus they meet for the first time in their rightful surroundings and Cupid wins.

                    Barbara Frietchie's eighteenth birthday is interrupted when she sees Union soldiers, who have taken control of her home town, Frederick, Maryland, foraging for food. Her screams bring Captain Trumbull, who arrests his men and, against her wishes, assists her. When Barbara's grandmother, who likes the Yankees, asks her to show Trumbull the flag given to her long ago by Thomas Jefferson, Barbara replies that she tore it because she hates Yankees. After Trumbull helps Barbara's brother Arthur elude capture on his return home, Barbara's attitude softens. When Barbara's father orders the courting captain away, the couple go to a neighboring town to marry, but the Confederates take the town, and Trumbull leaves. Arthur mistakenly shoots him and carries him into their home. Although Barbara prevents the Confederates from entering, she finds Trumbull dead in the morning. Enraged, her grandmother waves the flag, which Barbara mended, at the Union troops. Although Stonewall Jackson orders his men to march on, Jack Negly, Barbara's rejected suitor, fires and fatally wounds Barbara. Her grandmother covers both bodies with the flag.

                    The opening scene is of the interior of the Malamute saloon. Dangerous Dan McGrew and the lady that's known as Lou are seen seated at a table in one corner. A dog-sleigh stops outside, and its owner, a tired-looking, bedraggled miner, stumbles through the door. After treating the house, he sits down at the piano and begins to play. Into the soulful, stirring music he pours his pent up feelings of hatred, sorrow, love and regret. Years before, Jim Maxwell's best friend, Dan McGrew, had deceived his wife into believing him unfaithful. Their elopement completely unnerved him for a time. But finally he resolved to forget about it, until he next met Dan McGrew. Years afterwards, while prospecting, he met his daughter, now grown to womanhood and married. Her husband had been arrested for a murder committed by McGrew, and Maxwell assisted in effecting his escape. Just previous to the miner's entrance, Nell's husband had been captured in the saloon by the sheriff. As Maxwell finishes playing, he turns about, faces Dangerous Dan McGrew, and tells him, in uncomplimentary language, what he thinks of a man of his type. The lights go out, two guns blaze in the dark, and both men fall. Maxwell recovers and is reunited to Lou, his wife. McGrew dies. May 22 1915

                    Parigi, metà Ottocento. Margherita Gautier è una mondana alla moda. Bellissima, si distingue dalle colleghe per l'aspetto ed i modi. Ha per amanti uomini ricchi ed influenti e cambia spesso accompagnatore. Una sera, ad una festa, conosce Armando: è un colpo di fulmine, dalla travolgente passione. I due vanno a vivere insieme, fuori città, ma, dopo qualche mese, il padre di Armando, preoccupato per l'avvenire del figlio, interviene, supplicando la donna di lasciar libero il figlio. Margherita, che ama veramente e per la prima volta in vita sua, si lascia persuadere, e scrive ad Armando di aver deciso di rompere la relazione. Il giovane, sentendosi tradito, per vendicarsi la insulta durante una festa. Così Margherita cerca di stordirsi, ma il vortice dei piaceri non serve a far dimenticare; le emozioni e il dolore per il distacco dall'uomo che ama, finiscono per logorare la sua salute, e la donna muore di tisi pochi mesi più tardi, dopo essersi riconciliata con Armando sul letto di morte.

                    The story relates how a valuable diamond is stolen by an Englishman from the eye of an Indian idol. The Englishman, on his return to London, is pursued by three Indian priests in disguise whose object is to secure ""The Moonstone"" at all costs, as failing its recovery, the priests will lose caste. The Englishman, Hearncastle, is found drowned, presumably having been killed by the Indians. The diamond passes into possession of Franklin Blake, his friend. Blake is followed by a band of Indian magicians. He presents the diamond to his fiancée from whom it is stolen. A detective is called in. Another girl in love with Blake commits suicide and suspicion attaches to her, as she leaves a mysterious note for Blake. Subsequently, Blake finds the diamond in the possession of a money-lender. His fiancée, learning of the dead woman's attachment for Blake, quarrels with him. A doctor discovers that Blake walked in his sleep and took the diamond himself while in that state. The diamond was stolen from Blake while he was asleep and never recovered. The thief confessed and died, and Blake and his fiancée were reunited.

                    Brooke Travers, a young society man of a roving disposition and much leisure, gets into a cab with his valet and his trunks, to go to his yacht for a cruise. Arriving at the pier, the cabman demands an exorbitant charge for his fare, and, upon Travers resenting the charge, he is again soaked by the cabman, this time with his capable fists. Travers strikes back, and the cabman falls, his head hitting a curbstone. The ambulance surgeon arrives, pronounces the man dying, and advises Travers to flee. Taking the advice and the cab, Travers and his valet hasten for another wharf, and take ship for Central America. As they are landing at the little port of Porto Banos, the consul of that place, who is also an instigator of revolutions, offers to let Travers take his credentials and pose as Dictator in his place, pretending to be afraid of the yellow fever, but really because he has learned of a new revolution, and is afraid of his life. Travers, fearing the law is already on his track, eagerly accepts the offer, and goes ashore as the new Dictator. Then things happen with marvelous celerity, and Travers becomes the center of a small cyclone of trouble, the chief factors of which are the opposing faction of the revolution, the wife of the consul, a vengeful former sweetheart of the latter, and a pretty young missionary, with whom Travers has fallen desperately in love. How he finally comes unscathed from his many perils, and wins his lady love, form an interesting denouement.

After a policeman finds the children, Mrs. Nevinson sells her possessions to repay Drayton, who returns to raise Viola and the waif.
