Mortimer is a bit embarrassed by his change of heart and tries to remain incognito at the city clerk's office. Elaine and her father, the Rev. Dr. Harper (Grant Mitchell), live across the graveyard from the house in Brooklyn where Mortimer grew up. After the ceremony but before going on honeymoon to Niagara Falls, Mortimer and Elaine take a taxi to the old Brewster house, now occupied only by Mortimer's two maiden aunts, Aunt Abby (Josephine Hull) and Aunt Martha (Jean Adair), and by Mortimer's younger brother Teddy (John Alexander), to tell them the news.Before the happy couple arrives, Aunt Abby is entertaining the Rev. Harper to tea whilst Teddy plays the piano. Police Sergeant Brophy (Edward McNamara) and Officer O'Hara (Jack Carson), to whom Brophy is handing over his beat, call at the house to collect repaired toys for a charity. It becomes apparent that Teddy is delusional, believing he is President Theodore 'Teddy' Roosevelt, a condition all regard as a harmless eccentricity -- apart from his habit of blowing his bugle, which disturbs the neighbors. Arrangements have been made by Mortimer for Teddy to enter Happydale Sanatorium once the aunts have passed on.Aunt Martha comes home, the Rev. Harper leaves, and there are mysterious references to Teddy having ""to dig a new lock for the Panama Canal"" and ""looking in the window seat."" Before this is explained, Mortimer and Elaine arrive with their news -- Elaine goes to her father's house -- and there is also a reference to Mortimer's other brother, Jonathan (Raymond Massey). Left alone for a few minutes, Mortimer pokes around and finds a fresh corpse in the window seat. He immediately suspects Teddy is responsible, and confronts his aunts with this. ""But there's a body in the window seat!"" ""Yes, dear, we know."" It turns out the body is Mr. Adam Hoskins, whom the aunts have killed using poisoned elderberry wine (made with elderberries from the graveyard and tinctured with a cocktail of poisons from their father's laboratory). Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha have been poisoning lonely old men to help them find peace. Mr. Hoskins is their twelfth, the first being a Mr. Midgeley, who inspired them by dying of a heart attack. Teddy buries the victims in the cellar in the ""locks of Panama.""Mortimer is, understandably, rather concerned, and is too distracted to talk to Elaine when she tries to attract his attention. He loves his aunts and does not want the police involved, so he determines that Teddy, known to be a lunatic, should take the blame if the murders ever come to light; he thus has to immediately commit Teddy to Happydale. Commitment requires that papers be signed by Judge Cullman (Vaughan Glaser), Dr. Gilchrist (Chester Clute), and Teddy. As Mortimer tries to contact Happydale, a Mr. Gibbs (Edward McWade) arrives to look for a room to rent: he is almost poisoned by the aunts, but Mortimer snatches the wine away just in time. Much to the aunts' disappointment, Mortimer chases Mr. Gibbs away, telling them ""This is developing into a very bad habit!""Mortimer manages to talk to Mr. Witherspoon (Edward Everett Horton), manager of Happydale, on the telephone, and then rushes out to see Judge Cullman, admonishing the aunts to let no-one into the house before he returns. However, when Mortimer's brother Jonathan and his companion, plastic surgeon Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre) arrive, the aunts can't prevent them from entering. Jonathan looks like Boris Karloff as a result of Dr. Einstein's work, and so is not immediately recognized by the aunts, but he convinces them of his identity by remembering details of family history. Jonathan needs another new face, as the police are after him for the murder of one Mr. Spinalzo, whose corpse is in Jonathan's car.Mortimer manages to get Judge Cullman to sign the papers. At the house, Teddy shows Dr. Einstein the ""Panama Canal,"" where Einstein spots the useful unfilled grave, while Jonathan intimidates his aunts into letting him and Dr. Einstein stay. Jonathan decides to move the car round to the side of the house so he can bring Mr. Spinalzo's corpse in surreptitiously; simultaneously the aunts instruct Teddy to move the corpse of Mr. Hoskins from the window seat down to the cellar. Jonathan, Dr. Einstein and the aunts then 'go to bed,' all intending to be active later, Jonathan and Dr. Einstein to move Mr. Spinalzo, the aunts to hold funeral services for Mr. Hoskins. As soon as the house is dark, Teddy moves Mr. Hoskins down to the cellar, and then Jonathan passes Mr. Spinalzo through the window to Dr. Einstein, who manages to hide the corpse in the window seat before Elaine knocks and enters. She reacts when she learns who Jonathan is; he, suspicious she has seen him with the corpse and the car, tries to shut her in the cellar. The aunts, now dressed in mourning, are roused, and Mortimer returns. He promptly quarrels with Jonathan and once again neglects Elaine, who storms out as he calls Mr. Witherspoon.Mortimer looks again in the window seat to find a new corpse: ""Ye gods, there's another one!"" Aunt Abby, confronted, reacts indignantly to Mortimer's suggestion that this is one of her victims, and fetches Aunt Martha to look. When Mortimer and Jonathan both try to stop her, Mortimer realizes that Jonathan is responsible for this latest body. Mortimer offers Jonathan a chance to leave and take the evidence with him, and then Officer O'Hara arrives, wanting to tell Mortimer about a play he's writing. Mortimer gives Jonathan an ultimatum to leave. Jonathan decides not to, and Dr. Einstein discovers Mr. Hoskins' body in the cellar, which they think is Mortimer's work. Mortimer, however, wishes to cut no deal with Jonathan, and rushes out to get the signature of Dr. Gilchrist for Teddy's commitment papers.Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha come in, and to Jonathan's surprise, admit responsibility for Mr. Hoskins and their other victims. It turns out the aunts and Jonathan have each committed twelve murders, which Dr. Einstein finds hilarious -- he and Jonathan have traveled the world to achieve what the aunts have done staying at home in Brooklyn. As the aunts go down to hold services for Mr. Hoskins, Jonathan decides he needs 'one more' victim -- who will be his hated brother Mortimer. He moves Mr. Spinalzo to Panama and buries him with Mr. Hoskins, much to the aunts' indignation. Mortimer brings Dr. Gilchrist to the graveyard and brings Teddy out to meet him. Teddy greets Gilchrist as ""Dr. Livingstone"" -- ""he presumes."" Mortimer then sees Elaine and tells her their marriage must be called off as ""insanity runs in my family -- it practically gallops!"" Dr. Gilchrist, having just been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia by Teddy, signs the papers for his commitment. Jonathan plots Mortimer's murder with Dr. Einstein by 'the Melbourne method' -- two hours of torture.Mortimer persuades Teddy to sign the committal papers. Dr. Einstein tries to convince Mortimer to flee, but Mortimer is not listening; in a discussion about the idiocy of victims in plays he allows himself to be overpowered, gagged and tied up. Jonathan prepares to set to work on the Melbourne method. Dr. Einstein, distraught, needs a drink, and seizes the decanter of poisoned wine, pouring himself and Jonathan each a glass; as they are about to drink, Teddy startles them by blowing his bugle and they drop their glasses. Jonathan, realizing the neighborhood will be roused, decides on murder the quick way, but Officer O'Hara arrives and sees Mortimer tied up. Dr. Einstein persuades him that Mortimer is enacting a scene from a play. O'Hara refuses to untie Mortimer, and instead (with a captive audience) recounts the plot of the play he is writing. Jonathan tries to kill O'Hara, but is knocked out by Dr. Einstein using a shoe. Sergeant Brophy and another policeman, Officer Saunders (John Ridgely), arrive and telephone back to the station ""calling off the big manhunt."" The manhunt is for O'Hara, who has not called in, but Jonathan believes they're talking about him and gives himself up. Then he reacts violently to the suggestion that he looks ""like Boris Karloff.""In the resulting fight Mortimer frees himself. Lieutenant Rooney (James Gleason) arrives and recognizes Jonathan as an escapee from the Indiana Prison for the Criminally Insane. Teddy's President Roosevelt act confuses the Lieutenant, but Mortimer assures him that Teddy is due to go to Happydale, and that Teddy's tales of ""thirteen bodies in the cellar"" are part of his delusion. However, Teddy has to be persuaded to re-sign the commitment papers as Teddy Brewster rather than Teddy Roosevelt. Mr. Witherspoon arrives to collect Teddy (to go ""on his hunting trip to Africa""). Elaine sneaks into the house through the cellar.Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha, distraught about being separated from Teddy, want to commit themselves to Happydale too. Mr. Witherspoon is reluctant, as he thinks they are sane, but when they also start talking about the ""thirteen bodies in the cellar,"" he agrees. Needing a doctor's signature, they rope in Dr. Einstein. Einstein then escapes even though his wanted description is telephoned through in his hearing and that of the Lieutenant. Mortimer signs the commitment papers as next of kin, which worries the aunts. They reveal that he is in fact not a Brewster; his father was a chef on a tramp steamer and his mother was a cook whom the aunt's brother married. Mortimer is delighted (""I'm the son of a sea-cook!"") that he isn't a biological member of the homicidally insane Brewster family, and so can stay married to Elaine without fear that he will go mad and breed mad children. Elaine emerges from the cellar, having discovered the graves, and has to be kissed by an ecstatic Mortimer into forgetting this. The movie ends as he picks her up and runs away, much to the amazement of the taxicab driver (Garry Owen), who has been waiting for them throughout.","
    
                    Mortimer Brewster is a newspaperman and author known for his diatribes against marriage. We watch him being married at city hall in the opening scene. Now all that is required is a quick trip home to tell Mortimer's two maiden aunts. While trying to break the news, he finds out his aunts' hobby; killing lonely old men and burying them in the cellar. It gets worse.

                    The year is 1941. The location is a small house next to a cemetery in Brooklyn. In this house live two kind, thoughtful, sweet old ladies, Martha and Abby Brewster who have developed a very bad habit. It appears that they murder lonely old men who have some sort of religious affiliation and they consider doing it a charity. They then leave it to their bugle blowing nephew Teddy (who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt) to take them to the Panama Canal (the cellar) and bury them. In this instance, the ""poor fellow"" suffers from yellow fever found in the window seat. It is another of their nephews Mortimer Brewster, a dramatic critic, who returns home only to find the man in the seat by mistake. Another nephew, Jonathon, returns to the home after years of fleeing the authorities due to his ""unofficial practice"" of killing people and using their faces to change his. However the results cause him to look like Boris Karloff (this angers him upon the mention of his similarity to the actor) due to the poor craftsmanship of his German accented, alcoholic sidekick Dr. Einstein. As the story continues, we see each character trying to find resolve in their suddenly been flipped upside-down lives. Mortimer tries to keep his aunts safe and prevent them from continuing their nasty habit while trying to stay sane with the woman he loves (Elaine Harper), the aunts try to continue their ""charities"", and Jonathon tries to make a wealthy practice that is stationed inside the home.

Neff, clearly in pain, sits down at his desk and tells the whole story into a Dictaphone for his colleague Barton Keyes (Robinson), a claims adjuster.It is the story of how he meets the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) during a routine house call to renew an automobile insurance policy for her husband. A flirtation develops, at least until Neff hears Phyllis wonder how she could take out a policy on her husband's life without him knowing it. Neff knows she means murder and wants no part of it.Phyllis pursues Neff to his own home, and persuades him that the two of them, together, should kill her husband. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and comes up with a plan in which Phyllis's husband will die an unlikely death, in this case being thrown from a train. Pacific All-Risk will therefore be required, by the ""double indemnity"" clause in the insurance policy, to pay the widow twice the normal amount.Keyes, a tenacious investigator, does not suspect foul play at first, but eventually concludes that the Dietrichson woman and an unknown accomplice must be behind the husband's death. He has no reason to be suspicious of Neff, someone he has worked with for quite some time and admires.Neff is not only worried about Keyes. The victim's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather), comes to him convinced that her stepmother, Phyllis is behind her father's death because her mother also died under suspicious circumstances when she was her nurse. Neff begins to care about what might happen to Lola, both of whose parents have been murdered. It is for this reason Phyllis wants her killed because she had suspected her of murdering her parents in the first place.Then he learns Phyllis is seeing Lola's boyfriend, Nino, behind his back. Trying to save himself and no longer caring about the money, Neff believes the only way out is to make the police think Phyllis and Lola's boyfriend did the murder, which is what Keyes now believes anyway. However, when Neff and Phyllis meet, she tells him she has been seeing Lola's boyfriend only to provoke him into killing the suspicious Lola in a jealous rage. Neff, now wholly disgusted, is about to kill Phyllis when she shoots him first. Neff is badly wounded but still standing and walks towards her, telling her to shoot again. Phyllis does not shoot and he takes the gun from her. She says she never loved him or anyone else and had been using him all along, ""until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot."" Neff coldly says he does not believe this new ploy. Phyllis hugs him tightly but then pulls away and looks up at him, startled that he has not responded. Neff says ""Goodbye, baby,"" then shoots and kills her. Before leaving, he convinces Nino to not go inside because Phyllis was responsibile for trying to break up him and Lola. Neff convinces him that she still loves him and she's waiting for him to call her. Nino reluctantly agrees to call Lola and takes his quarter.Neff drives to his office where he dictates his full confession to Keyes, who arrives and hears enough of the confession to understand everything. Neff tells Keyes he is going to Mexico rather than face a death sentence but collapses to the floor before he can reach the elevator.[edit] Alternate endingWilder shot an alternate ending to the film (to appease censors), featuring Neff paying for his crime by going to the gas chamber.

Phyllis proposes to kill her husband to receive the proceeds of an accident insurance policy and Walter devises a scheme to receive twice the amount based on a double indemnity clause. When Mr. Dietrichson is found dead on a train track, the police accept the determination of accidental death. However, the insurance analyst and Walter's best friend Barton Keyes does not buy the story and suspects that Phyllis has murdered her husband with the help of another man.

It all started the previous May, when he stopped at a client's home for a routine renewal inquiry and instead met the client's wife, Phyllis Dietrichson. She asked about buying accident insurance for her husband without his knowledge, and Neff understood that she intended to kill him. Neff and Phyllis were soon lovers, with Neff taking charge of the killing. Initially their plan went off without a hitch, but then Neff realized that he had been played and decided to do something about it.

                    Alone in his company's Los Angeles offices late one evening and under some distress, insurance salesman Walter Neff dictates an inter-office memo to his colleague, claims manager Barton Keyes, about killing one of his clients, a Mr. Dietrichson. Barton suspected that Dietrichson was murdered by his wife, Phyllis Dietrichson, who was claiming the double indemnity on her husband's accident insurance policy. Walter met Phyllis innocently enough - he was dropping off auto insurance renewal papers for her husband - but quickly fell under her seductive charms. They were obvious to each other in their mutual attraction. After deducing that she was planning on killing her husband since she stated he was abusive and claiming the insurance moneys on a policy her husband would have no idea existed, Walter decided to go into cahoots with her so that he could help her craft and execute the ""perfect"" insurance policy, and plan and execute the ""perfect"" murder beyond Keyes' scrutiny, leading to them living in bliss together and with money. Beyond any slip-up in the plan, Keyes and Dietrichson's disgruntled daughter, Phyllis' step-daughter Lola Dietrichson, factored into their ability to pull off the plan successfully. Walter concludes his memo for its reason, which he considers more a confession.

    Synopsis
    Walter Neff (MacMurray) is a successful insurance salesman for Pacific All-Risk returning to his office building in downtown Los Angeles late one night. Neff, clearly in pain, sits down at his desk and tells the whole story into a Dictaphone for his colleague Barton Keyes (Robinson), a claims adjuster.It is the story of how he meets the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) during a routine house call to renew an automobile insurance policy for her husband. A flirtation develops, at least until Neff hears Phyllis wonder how she could take out a policy on her husband's life without him knowing it. Neff knows she means murder and wants no part of it.Phyllis pursues Neff to his own home, and persuades him that the two of them, together, should kill her husband. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and comes up with a plan in which Phyllis's husband will die an unlikely death, in this case being thrown from a train. Pacific All-Risk will therefore be required, by the ""double indemnity"" clause in the insurance policy, to pay the widow twice the normal amount.Keyes, a tenacious investigator, does not suspect foul play at first, but eventually concludes that the Dietrichson woman and an unknown accomplice must be behind the husband's death. He has no reason to be suspicious of Neff, someone he has worked with for quite some time and admires.Neff is not only worried about Keyes. The victim's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather), comes to him convinced that her stepmother, Phyllis is behind her father's death because her mother also died under suspicious circumstances when she was her nurse. Neff begins to care about what might happen to Lola, both of whose parents have been murdered. It is for this reason Phyllis wants her killed because she had suspected her of murdering her parents in the first place.Then he learns Phyllis is seeing Lola's boyfriend, Nino, behind his back. Trying to save himself and no longer caring about the money, Neff believes the only way out is to make the police think Phyllis and Lola's boyfriend did the murder, which is what Keyes now believes anyway. However, when Neff and Phyllis meet, she tells him she has been seeing Lola's boyfriend only to provoke him into killing the suspicious Lola in a jealous rage. Neff, now wholly disgusted, is about to kill Phyllis when she shoots him first. Neff is badly wounded but still standing and walks towards her, telling her to shoot again. Phyllis does not shoot and he takes the gun from her. She says she never loved him or anyone else and had been using him all along, ""until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot."" Neff coldly says he does not believe this new ploy. Phyllis hugs him tightly but then pulls away and looks up at him, startled that he has not responded. Neff says ""Goodbye, baby,"" then shoots and kills her. Before leaving, he convinces Nino to not go inside because Phyllis was responsibile for trying to break up him and Lola. Neff convinces him that she still loves him and she's waiting for him to call her. Nino reluctantly agrees to call Lola and takes his quarter.Neff drives to his office where he dictates his full confession to Keyes, who arrives and hears enough of the confession to understand everything. Neff tells Keyes he is going to Mexico rather than face a death sentence but collapses to the floor before he can reach the elevator.[edit] Alternate endingWilder shot an alternate ending to the film (to appease censors), featuring Neff paying for his crime by going to the gas chamber. This footage is lost, but stills of the scene still exist.source:Wikipedia

                    In the Atlantic during WWII, a ship and a German U-boat are involved in a battle and both are sunk. The survivors from the ship gather in one of the boats. They are from a variety of backgrounds: an international journalist, a rich businessman, the radio operator, a nurse, a steward, a sailor and an engineer with communist tendencies. Trouble starts when they pull a man out of the water who turns out to be from the U-boat.

After the baby is buried at sea, the mother drowns herself. Though the inhabitants of the lifeboat come from vastly different backgrounds, they quickly set aside the social and economic differences that divide them in a united effort to survive. A German seaman Willy is picked up out of the sea and Constane interprets for him. Willi suggests in German the direction toward Bermuda. During a crisis, he shouts at them in English. He was the U-boat commander. Willi has a compass and is strong enough to row them to a German supply ship The others allow him to take command of the boat, their only hope of survival is to be rescued by a German supply ship, which will presumably take them straight to a concentration camp.

                    An American freighter sailing from New York to London is torpedoed and sunk by a Nazi U-boat, which in turn is bombed and destroyed in return fire. Renowned and well-appointed photojournalist Connie Porter, whose stories focus on her in the middle of whatever the subject she is covering, is alone in one of the freighter's lifeboats, she helped aboard by Joe, one of the ship's stewards, when the ship started going down. She is most concerned about the photographs she managed to take of the bombing and the accompanying story she will write first, her appearance and her material possessions second, and the rest of the world third. Before the lifeboat leaves the area of the debris field, other survivors of the bombing are able to take refuge on the lifeboat: C.J. Rittenhouse, nicknamed ""Ritt"", a self-made wealthy industrialist; Alice MacKenzie, an army nurse; Mrs. Higley, a shell-shocked woman from Bristol who went to the States to recover only to give birth there, with that baby, Johnny, dying in the process of the rescue; brusque womanizer Kovac, an engine room man; Stanley, nicknamed ""Sparks"", a radio man; Gus Smith, another crew member, who is sensitive to the fact that his real last name is Schmidt; and Joe, the aforementioned steward. However, it is the ninth and last passenger to board that causes the rest just a little consternation: a man named Willi, from the Nazi U-boat, who says that he was only a crew member taking orders, and who apparently speaks only German (a language Connie speaks fluently) and no English. In their wait to be rescued, they have to work together to survive, which ends up being a difficult process at times as they have differing views on certain fundamental things, such as who should be in charge and thus what they should do, and just how much they should trust Willi, who may be the most knowledgeable among them in survival on the seas. But it's those fundamental differences in them as people which may be their biggest threat in surviving.

Walking on the beach with their dog Bobby, they climb a cliff and wind up in the garden of a large uninhabited house. When Bobby spies a squirrel and chases it into the house through an open window, Roderick and Pam follow, intending to save the squirrel from their dog. But the squirrel more than holds its own and escapes up the chimney after nipping Rick's hand.Once the crisis is past Pam notices how lovely the inside of the house is and decides to explore. It reminds them both of their childhood home, and they become enamored of it immediately. Pam becomes excited at the prospect of actually buying the house, and has an answer for each argument that Rick comes up with including the fact that Rick, who writes reviews of music for a newspaper, would be able to compose his own music. They decide to see about the possibility of buying the house, after Pam exclaims that ""Important decisions must be made quickly.""Discovering from a woman in the nearby village that the house, called Windward, is for sale, they go to call on the owner, Commander Beach. The Commander is not at home, but his granddaughter, Stella Meredith, welcomes them in to wait for him. But Stella's demeanor changes from warm and friendly to almost hostile when she discovers their purpose in visiting. While she tries to send them away her grandfather arrives home. Stella pleads with him to not sell the house, but he dismisses her and sits down to discuss the transaction.The Commander assures Rick and Pam that the house is sound, and that a lot of money was spent on it twenty years before when he gave it to his daughter Mary as a wedding gift. Rick and Pamela make an offer of 1200 pounds, which is considerably below the house's actual value. To their surprise, the Commander accepts their offer, saying that 1200 pounds in the bank for Stella would ease his mind. The commander asks whether they would be bothered by disturbances of which tenants had complained in the past. Pam and Roderick dismiss the hints at a dark past and the sale is made.Brother and sister go back to their new house to take a closer look, including a room that was locked and they were unable to explore before. The room is a painter's studio, and Pam exclaims it to be the one ugly room in the house. Rick thinks it would make a perfect room for his own studio. As they talk, the pair become less and less enthusiastic, and even begin to think they have made a mistake in buying the house. The howling of their dog below breaks their reverie, and they wonder why he refuses to climb the stairs to the floor above.Admiring a large window, they spot Stella outside on the lawn. Although Roderick seems to have no sympathy for her, Pam does, and tells Rick that Stella feels shut out of her own home now.Pam is set to stay on at the inn, but before heading back from Biddlecomb to London to make arrangements, including getting their furniture out of storage, and collecting Lizzie, their childhood housekeeper, Roderick visits the local tobacconist and buys some postcards of Windward, which leads him to explain that he is the new owner. The shop owner bemoans the fact that the previous tenants started ugly rumors, no doubt to get out of their lease and the debts they owed in the village. He also recounts how the Commander's daughter had died after a fall from the cliff by the house.Returning to his car, he meets Stella, who apologies for her rudeness the previous day. She mentions that her mother told her not to feel that way. Rick is puzzled, since he now knows that Stella's mother is dead, but Stella explains that she was referring to a portrait of her mother painted by her father. They discuss how unfair it is for her grandfather to hate the house just because his daughter died there. Rick decides to kidnap Stella for the afternoon, cancelling her plans for a library visit to get a new Dickens novel and some wool-matching in favor of a sail on a rented sailboat.Roderick's boasting of never getting seasick comes back to haunt him when he does just that. Stella gives him her handkerchief to wipe his brow and he recognizes the scent of mimosa. Stella tells him it was her mother's scent, and she has made a bottle of it sent to her by her absent father last for many years.Taking off for London, Roderick asks Stella to be sure and drop in on Pamela while he is away. She declines a ride home, and exclaims that she is happy that he and Pam will be living in the house.Weeks later Roderick arrives back after dark with Lizzie. Pam is annoyed since she wanted them to see everything while it was still daylight. Rick begins to call for Bobby, and Pam explains that the dog has wandered off. Pamela has done wonders with the house and Lizzie and Roderick are impressed. Rick asks Pam how Stella likes the changes, but Pam says she hasn't seen Stella at all, despite having invited her. Her grandfather rebuffed the invitations, and Roderick is confused since he was sure Stella would become friends with Pamela while he was away.Getting ready to turn in, Lizzie's cat Whiskey refuses to go up the staircase. Later Pam goes into her brother's room, seeming to want to discuss something. But his enthusiasm over the house changes her mind and she wishes him a good night's sleep and goes to her own room.Hours later Rick is awakened by the sound of a woman sobbing. Thinking it is Pam he goes out onto the landing, where she joins him. Pam explains that the cries have come before and she has searched for their source without success. She knows the sounds will die away at dawn, which they do. They both go back to bed, and Rick comes up with some unlikely explanations for the sounds as he returns to bed.The next day Rick visits Commander Beach to get information about the disturbances. Asking about the history of the house, he learns that the Commander's ancestors did not experience anything out of the ordinary. While talking Stella comes in, but her grandfather refuses to allow her to converse with Rick, and she leaves for church. Rick's thinking out loud touches on the fact that the noises started since Mary Meredith's death, which upsets the Commander greatly. Rick apologizes for implying his daughter haunts the house. As he is leaving the Commander insists that Stella will not set foot in the house, which leads Rick to realize the Commander actually does think the house is haunted.Stella meets Rick outside and arranges a visit to the house, unknown to her grandfather. After church she informs the Commander that she intends to befriend the Fitzgeralds no matter what. The Commander then telephones Miss Holloway, a woman who was Mary's closest friend and who now runs a retreat. He arranges to go to Miss Holloway's to discuss his fears about the house and Stella.Stella spends the evening at Windward and is taken with the way the house looks, and especially with her old nursery where she lived her first three years. She remembers a warm, loving feeling when someone would bring her a nightlight, and fear when someone else would remove it. Rick then shows her the studio where her father painted her mothers portrait, or more often, portraits of a Spanish model named Carmel. Stella asks Rick to play something on the piano and he plays a tune she's never heard before. When he stops to correct a note on his sheet music Stella realizes he wrote the music, and then he tells her its title is ""To Stella, By Starlight.""As he continues to play, the tune becomes sadder and sadder, and the candles dim by themselves. Then Stella's mood darkens and she rushes out of the room, and the front door, heading straight for the cliff edge where Mary died. Rick follows, catching her just in time; she says she had no feeling of danger at all. Pam comes out to bring them in to dinner and before they get back inside they hear Lizzie screaming. Lizzie tells Rick that she saw a crawling mist at the studio door, which was forming into the figure of a woman. Stella overhears her and while Pam and Rick attend to Lizzie, Stella returns to the studio, where Rick finds her unconscious. They send for Dr. Scott and put Stella to bed in the nursery. She explains that the studio tuned cold while she was in it and she became afraid, then fainted.Dr. Scott spends the rest of the night and they all sit up watching until dawn. Scott recounts all the stories revolving around the haunting and the history of Mary, Meredith and Carmel and the open scandal in the village. There was also a hint that Mary had been murdered by Carmel. Later they sense the aroma of mimosa, and see a small light in the nursery. Rushing in to check on Stella they find her at the window, at peace. Stella says she knows her mother is the presence in the house, and for the first time felt true love.Rick and Pam allow the doctor to take Stella home and tell her that she cannot return to the house. After Stella leaves Pam thinks that maybe the ghost is gone since it has now found Stella again. They check out this theory by going into the studio, but find the room as clammy and rotten as ever. Soon after, they hear the moaning again. Rick tells Pam that she was right about not having ""a ghost"" anymore because now he thinks they have two of them.Rick goes to visit Stella, and tells her she mustn't visit Windward ever again. He proposes that she go away with him, never to return. She begs him to take her to the house. He wants to tear it down and forget about the past. She promises she will find a way to return to the house and he promises to prevent it.Rick goes to Scott's where he finds Pam. Rick says Stella is being torn apart by the conflict. Pam suggests a séance at Windward, and Rick jumps at the idea, only he wants to rig the answers to set Stella's mind at rest by pretending the spirit of her mother wants her to stay away from Windward.That night the séance is held using an upturned wine glass and anagram letters. Stella tries to contact her mother and when she asks if she should stay away from Windward the glass goes to ""No,"" much to the consternation of Rick and Scott who had been trying to push it towards the ""Yes"" card. Then a message is spelled out and Stella goes into a trance during which she begins to speak in Spanish. The room then is flooded with the scent of mimosa, followed by the dreaded cold. As the door bell rings and is ignored, a spectral shape begins to appear and a window is smashed by the Commander who has come to rescue his granddaughter.Scott drives Stella and her grandfather home, and is dismissed as the family doctor. After Scott leaves, Miss Holloway enters, and the sleeping Stella is carried to a waiting car for the drive back to Miss Holloway's retreat.The morning after the séance Lizzy is cleaning up the broken window glass and takes issue with the makings of the séance. Rick promises not to do something similar again and says they intend now to go looking for facts behind the haunting, but laments that all the principal players are dead. Lizzie corrects him, saying that the trained nurse, Miss Holloway is still alive (a fact she discovered while gossiping at her temporary housing with a local family, where she moved after seeing the ghost.)Unaware that Stella is there, Rick and Pam go to see Miss Holloway at her place, the Mary Meredith Retreat. Miss Holloway recounts the history of her time at Windward, stressing how evil Carmel was and how when Mary tried to get rid of her, she refused to give up Mary's husband and returned. Miss Holloway tells them that Mary died trying to prevent Carmel from throwing the baby Stella off the cliff. The next day Carmel came back to Windward with pneumonia and Miss Holloway nursed her until her death.After Rick and Pam leave, Miss Holloway goes to see Stella, who is a virtual prisoner at the retreat. She questions Stella about her experience at Windward and her dash toward the cliff.Before returning home the Fitzgeralds stop by to see Dr. Scott, and he pulls out an old journal from his predecessor. The journal hints that Miss Holloway had allowed Carmel to die through negligence. Scott is called to the Commander's house, to attend the old man who had an episode.Pam and Rick take the journal home to look for more clues, and the room suddenly becomes full of the mimosa scent. The book's pages turn by themselves, unseen. Scott comes to Windward and tells them that Stella is at Miss Holloway's. They decide to return to the retreat immediately since the thought of Stella being under Miss Holloway's influence is abhorrent. They telephone Miss Holloway and tell her they are coming back. Miss Holloway takes the opportunity to send Stella back home, but tells her she must go immediately to Windward.When Pam and Rick and Scott arrive at the retreat they discover that Stella has been sent back to Windward, and Miss Holloway descends into full blown madness.Stella arrives at a darkened Windward and goes inside. Following the sound of her name being called she goes up into the studio, where she finds her grandfather collapsed in a chair. Hed been notified by someone at Miss Holloway's and walked over to warn Stella. Soon the mist reappears and forms itself into a woman. Commander Beach dies at the sight and Stella is driven once again to the cliff, where she is rescued again just in time by Rick.Dr. Scott finds the Commander dead, and Stella says it was her mother that did it. The room is again flooded with mimosa and the journals pages fly open, this time seen by all. An entry in the journal tells of Carmel having a child and how Mary had rejected motherhood. The news means that Stella is actually Carmel's child, and Stella is happy at the news. Distant laughter is heard and it appears that Carmel has what she was waiting for and leaves Windward. Just then the ghost of Mary materializes on the staircase. Rick confronts it and defies the spirit with the truth. He flings a candelabrum at the specter, which dissipates.Flush with their victory over Mary they notice that Whiskey is going up the staircase. Rick says he thinks Bobby will come back, but Scott indicates that he and Pam have other plans for him. Stella remarks that Rick is still trembling and Rick, nodding towards the staircase, responds that ""she might have been my mother-in-law.""","

                    Commander Beech is more than happy to sell Wynward House, a cliff-side manor outside of Biddlecombe on the south coast of England, to Londoners, brother and sister Roderick and Pamela Fitzgerald, who want to use it as their primary residence. Commander Beech, who sells it to them for a mere fraction of its market value, is up front that the last tenants he had in the house moved out because of the proverbial bumps they continually heard in the night. The sale is much to the dismay of the Commander's twenty year old maternal granddaughter, Stella Meredith, her long deceased parents to who the house originally belonged. Despite her mother, Mary Meredith, having died from falling off the cliffs when Stella was three when she herself last lived there, Stella has a strong emotional bond to the house as it is one of the last connections she has to her parents. After the sale, the Commander is less than cordial to the Fitzgeralds, with who he forbids Stella to associate, regardless of Stella and Rick's increasing friendship which blossoms into a romance. Rick and Pam also begin to hear those bumps in the night - most specifically a woman's wailing - and have an especially cold emotional feeling whenever in the house's ocean-view studio. With the help of the local doctor Dr. Scott, they begin to wonder if the rumors of Mary and/or a Spanish gypsy named Carmel (Mr. Meredith's supposed mistress) haunting the house - most specifically the studio - are indeed true, which the Commander believes places Stella in harm's way if she is ever to enter the house. So that Rick, Stella and Pamela can live in peace, they decide to do whatever they can to discover the truth. What they don't know is that the Commander and an old friend of Mary's, Miss Holloway, know more than they divulge.

Rick decides to kidnap Stella for the afternoon, cancelling her plans for a library visit to get a new Dickens novel and some wool-matching in favor of a sail on a rented sailboat.Roderick's boasting of never getting seasick comes back to haunt him when he does just that. Stella gives him her handkerchief to wipe his brow and he recognizes the scent of mimosa. Stella tells him it was her mother's scent, and she has made a bottle of it sent to her by her absent father last for many years.Taking off for London, Roderick asks Stella to be sure and drop in on Pamela while he is away. She declines a ride home, and exclaims that she is happy that he and Pam will be living in the house.Weeks later Roderick arrives back after dark with Lizzie. Pam is annoyed since she wanted them to see everything while it was still daylight. Rick begins to call for Bobby, and Pam explains that the dog has wandered off. Pamela has done wonders with the house and Lizzie and Roderick are impressed. Rick asks Pam how Stella likes the changes, but Pam says she hasn't seen Stella at all, despite having invited her. Her grandfather rebuffed the invitations, and Roderick is confused since he was sure Stella would become friends with Pamela while he was away.Getting ready to turn in, Lizzie's cat Whiskey refuses to go up the staircase. Later Pam goes into her brother's room, seeming to want to discuss something. But his enthusiasm over the house changes her mind and she wishes him a good night's sleep and goes to her own room.Hours later Rick is awakened by the sound of a woman sobbing. Thinking it is Pam he goes out onto the landing, where she joins him. Pam explains that the cries have come before and she has searched for their source without success. She knows the sounds will die away at dawn, which they do. They both go back to bed, and Rick comes up with some unlikely explanations for the sounds as he returns to bed.The next day Rick visits Commander Beach to get information about the disturbances. Asking about the history of the house, he learns that the Commander's ancestors did not experience anything out of the ordinary. While talking Stella comes in, but her grandfather refuses to allow her to converse with Rick, and she leaves for church. Rick's thinking out loud touches on the fact that the noises started since Mary Meredith's death, which upsets the Commander greatly. Rick apologizes for implying his daughter haunts the house. As he is leaving the Commander insists that Stella will not set foot in the house, which leads Rick to realize the Commander actually does think the house is haunted.Stella meets Rick outside and arranges a visit to the house, unknown to her grandfather. After church she informs the Commander that she intends to befriend the Fitzgeralds no matter what. The Commander then telephones Miss Holloway, a woman who was Mary's closest friend and who now runs a retreat. He arranges to go to Miss Holloway's to discuss his fears about the house and Stella.Stella spends the evening at Windward and is taken with the way the house looks, and especially with her old nursery where she lived her first three years. She remembers a warm, loving feeling when someone would bring her a nightlight, and fear when someone else would remove it. Rick then shows her the studio where her father painted her mothers portrait, or more often, portraits of a Spanish model named Carmel. Stella asks Rick to play something on the piano and he plays a tune she's never heard before. When he stops to correct a note on his sheet music Stella realizes he wrote the music, and then he tells her its title is ""To Stella, By Starlight.""As he continues to play, the tune becomes sadder and sadder, and the candles dim by themselves. Then Stella's mood darkens and she rushes out of the room, and the front door, heading straight for the cliff edge where Mary died. Rick follows, catching her just in time; she says she had no feeling of danger at all. Pam comes out to bring them in to dinner and before they get back inside they hear Lizzie screaming. Lizzie tells Rick that she saw a crawling mist at the studio door, which was forming into the figure of a woman. Stella overhears her and while Pam and Rick attend to Lizzie, Stella returns to the studio, where Rick finds her unconscious. They send for Dr. Scott and put Stella to bed in the nursery. She explains that the studio tuned cold while she was in it and she became afraid, then fainted.Dr. Scott spends the rest of the night and they all sit up watching until dawn. Scott recounts all the stories revolving around the haunting and the history of Mary, Meredith and Carmel and the open scandal in the village. There was also a hint that Mary had been murdered by Carmel. Later they sense the aroma of mimosa, and see a small light in the nursery. Rushing in to check on Stella they find her at the window, at peace. Stella says she knows her mother is the presence in the house, and for the first time felt true love.Rick and Pam allow the doctor to take Stella home and tell her that she cannot return to the house. After Stella leaves Pam thinks that maybe the ghost is gone since it has now found Stella again. They check out this theory by going into the studio, but find the room as clammy and rotten as ever. Soon after, they hear the moaning again. Rick tells Pam that she was right about not having ""a ghost"" anymore because now he thinks they have two of them.Rick goes to visit Stella, and tells her she mustn't visit Windward ever again. He proposes that she go away with him, never to return. She begs him to take her to the house. He wants to tear it down and forget about the past. She promises she will find a way to return to the house and he promises to prevent it.Rick goes to Scott's where he finds Pam. Rick says Stella is being torn apart by the conflict. Pam suggests a séance at Windward, and Rick jumps at the idea, only he wants to rig the answers to set Stella's mind at rest by pretending the spirit of her mother wants her to stay away from Windward.That night the séance is held using an upturned wine glass and anagram letters. Stella tries to contact her mother and when she asks if she should stay away from Windward the glass goes to ""No,"" much to the consternation of Rick and Scott who had been trying to push it towards the ""Yes"" card. Then a message is spelled out and Stella goes into a trance during which she begins to speak in Spanish. The room then is flooded with the scent of mimosa, followed by the dreaded cold. As the door bell rings and is ignored, a spectral shape begins to appear and a window is smashed by the Commander who has come to rescue his granddaughter.Scott drives Stella and her grandfather home, and is dismissed as the family doctor. After Scott leaves, Miss Holloway enters, and the sleeping Stella is carried to a waiting car for the drive back to Miss Holloway's retreat.The morning after the séance Lizzy is cleaning up the broken window glass and takes issue with the makings of the séance. Rick promises not to do something similar again and says they intend now to go looking for facts behind the haunting, but laments that all the principal players are dead. Lizzie corrects him, saying that the trained nurse, Miss Holloway is still alive (a fact she discovered while gossiping at her temporary housing with a local family, where she moved after seeing the ghost.)Unaware that Stella is there, Rick and Pam go to see Miss Holloway at her place, the Mary Meredith Retreat. Miss Holloway recounts the history of her time at Windward, stressing how evil Carmel was and how when Mary tried to get rid of her, she refused to give up Mary's husband and returned. Miss Holloway tells them that Mary died trying to prevent Carmel from throwing the baby Stella off the cliff. The next day Carmel came back to Windward with pneumonia and Miss Holloway nursed her until her death.After Rick and Pam leave, Miss Holloway goes to see Stella, who is a virtual prisoner at the retreat. She questions Stella about her experience at Windward and her dash toward the cliff.Before returning home the Fitzgeralds stop by to see Dr. Scott, and he pulls out an old journal from his predecessor. The journal hints that Miss Holloway had allowed Carmel to die through negligence. Scott is called to the Commander's house, to attend the old man who had an episode.Pam and Rick take the journal home to look for more clues, and the room suddenly becomes full of the mimosa scent. The book's pages turn by themselves, unseen. Scott comes to Windward and tells them that Stella is at Miss Holloway's. They decide to return to the retreat immediately since the thought of Stella being under Miss Holloway's influence is abhorrent. They telephone Miss Holloway and tell her they are coming back. Miss Holloway takes the opportunity to send Stella back home, but tells her she must go immediately to Windward.When Pam and Rick and Scott arrive at the retreat they discover that Stella has been sent back to Windward, and Miss Holloway descends into full blown madness.Stella arrives at a darkened Windward and goes inside. Following the sound of her name being called she goes up into the studio, where she finds her grandfather collapsed in a chair. Hed been notified by someone at Miss Holloway's and walked over to warn Stella. Soon the mist reappears and forms itself into a woman. Commander Beach dies at the sight and Stella is driven once again to the cliff, where she is rescued again just in time by Rick.Dr. Scott finds the Commander dead, and Stella says it was her mother that did it. The room is again flooded with mimosa and the journals pages fly open, this time seen by all. An entry in the journal tells of Carmel having a child and how Mary had rejected motherhood. The news means that Stella is actually Carmel's child, and Stella is happy at the news. Distant laughter is heard and it appears that Carmel has what she was waiting for and leaves Windward. Just then the ghost of Mary materializes on the staircase. Rick confronts it and defies the spirit with the truth. He flings a candelabrum at the specter, which dissipates.Flush with their victory over Mary they notice that Whiskey is going up the staircase. Rick says he thinks Bobby will come back, but Scott indicates that he and Pam have other plans for him. Stella remarks that Rick is still trembling and Rick, nodding towards the staircase, responds that ""she might have been my mother-in-law.""

I'm in the process of correcting those and giving more detail to it, much of which I've already done. This is my favorite Bogart movie of all, and with all due respect to the original writer, I'm not completely re-writing it, but simply organizing it sequentially. I will have it completed in the next few days as time allows me.***Harry Morgan (Humphrey Bogart) and his sidekick Eddie (Walter Brennan) run a charter fishing boat in Martinique (controlled by the French government at Vichy, which in turn was Nazi-controlled after 1940). Their current client is an American fisherman named Johnson who grudgingly pulls out money to pay for gasoline for the boat, and who then ineptly loses two large marlins by not following Harry's orders. The second loss also includes all the tackle he was using. He tells Harry he is leaving Martinique in the morning and will pay him after he goes to the bank in the morning, because he doesn't have enough money on him.Back at the hotel, Gerard (Frenchy), who is the hotel owner and a member of the Free French resistance, comes to Harry's room and asks him to take on a smuggling job for the Free French Resistance movement. Suddenly a sultry young woman (Lauren Bacall) appears in his doorway asking for a match. Harry tosses her a box of matches and she leaves. Harry asks Frenchy who she is, and he says she came that afternoon on the plane from the south. Harry tells Frenchy he doesn't want any part of the movement or their activities.Later in the dining room he notices Marie with his American client, who acts too fresh for her taste. She brushes him off and goes to stand by the piano, where Cricket (Hoagy Carmichael) is playing and singing ""Am I Blue?"" She joins him in the verse and they harmonize well. Harry sees Marie pick up Johnson's wallet and leave the room. Frenchy stops at Harry's table and tells him he hasn't been able to head off the men who want to hire Harry's boat for the smuggling operation, and Harry tells him he'd better head them off. Harry follows Marie upstairs and stops her as she's entering her own room and makes her come with him into his room. He makes her hand over the wallet and finds it's full of traveller's checks and cash, enough to pay his bill, along with a plane reservation for earlier the next morning than Johnson had said he'd meet Harry to pay him. Harry is glad Slim (as he calls her), took the wallet and didn't return it after all. She says she needed money to leave Martinique.Frenchy comes to the door with his group of comrades who offer to pay Harry to pick up two people secretly from another Caribbean island and bring them back to Martinique. Eddie comes in during this business and asks the French resistance leader if he was ever stung by a dead bee. The man tries to shut Eddie up, but Slim takes up the question seriously, delighting Eddie and getting Harry's approval. Eddie leaves with a coin for a drink. Harry refuses to get involved, despite their pleadings. He leaves the room, taking Slim downstairs with him to confront Johnson and return his wallet and ask for the payment Johnson owes Harry. As Johnson is about to sign over the traveller's checks, the pro-Nazi French police open fire in the lounge at the resistance group that had come down from Harry's room, and Johnson gets killed by a stray bullet.Capt. M. Renard (Dan Seymour), the head of the local Gestapo, closes the hotel lounge and picks out four people for questioning--Frenchy, Harry, and Slim being three of the four. At the station, they confiscate Harry's money and passport and question everyone. Harry gets riled at the methods of questioning and fights back, then grabs Slim and tells her, ""Let's get out of here,"" which they do.Harry and Slim end up going to another bar, but they realize neither has any money, so Slim asks Harry if she should do her thing, and he says, ""Go right ahead."" She immediately turns on the flirtatious charm with a French officer there, and he gets up and starts dancing with her. Harry leaves, grinning. He knows she's ""good"" at what she does, but it begins to bother him.Later, she comes to his room with a bottle she has presumably charmed out of the man she was with, but Harry's reaction makes her feel cheap and she leaves, angry. He follows her across the hall to her room and they have it out. They have their first kiss, then another and, as she's leaving his room, she tells him to whistle if he needs anything. ""You know how to whistle, don't you Steve? You just put your lips together and . . . blow."" She shuts the door and he lets out a low wolf whistle.His American client dead without paying him, the rest of his money confiscated by the police, having refused Slim's last few dollars, Harry reluctantly takes the smuggling job. He's supposed to pick up the two Frenchmen from another island and deliver them back to Martinique in the middle of the night. He makes them pay him in advance, and he arranges a plane ticket for Slim for that afternoon to fly back to her home.Harry doesn't want to take Eddie with him into danger so he insults and slaps Eddie to keep him on shore while he goes out to pick up the Frenchmen. Eddie tricks him and smuggles himself aboard. Eddie comes out of hiding and confronts Harry, telling him he knew it was all a lie. Together they pick up their cargo which turns out to be a man and his wife, Paul and Hellene de Bursac (Walter Molnar and Dolores Moran). On the way back to Martinique they encounter a patrol boat and the Frenchman takes one in the shoulder. Harry shoots out the patrol boat's spotlight, and they head back to their destination in the foggy night waters.Harry and Eddie get the Frenchman and his wife back to Martinique. They find that Slim intentionally missed the plane home and has been hired to sing with Cricket and his combo. She helps Harry remove the bullet from de Bursac's shoulder while his wife makes demands and has hysterics and finally faints. Slim keeps her cool but is pointedly jealous of Madam de Bursac's flirting with Harry, and Harry's obvious response to her.Captain Renard tries to get Eddie drunk to find out where the Frenchman and his wife are. Harry intervenes and breaks up the questioning. It turns out that de Bursac is actually supposed to get a resistance leader off Devil's Island to help the cause, and he wishes he had Harry's courage. Soon afterward, Captain Renard again gets hold of Eddie, and tries to blackmail Harry into giving over the location of the Frenchman by threatening to withhold liquor from Eddie to make him go into delirium tremens and crack up. Harry gets a gun from his desk drawer and shoots one of Renard's henchmen and handcuffs the other and Renard. He beats them both until they agree to make the arrangements so that the de Bursacs, Harry, Eddie, and Slim can all leave the island for good.With everything fixed up, they gather in the hotel lounge where Slim wins over Eddie when she asks him, ""Was you ever stung by a dead bee?"" Eddie says she's all right and she goes over to say goodbye to Cricket who's playing piano. He asks her if she's happy, and Slim says ""What do you think?"" doing a dance back over to her ""Steve.""","

However, since the second world war is happening around them business is not what it could be and after a customer who owes them a large sum fails to pay they are forced against their better judgment to violate their preferred neutrality and to take a job for the resistance transporting a fugitive on the run from the Nazis to Martinique.

During the operation they are spotted by a patrol boat, but Morgan extinguishes their lantern by a gunshot, and slips away with his boat. Next morning Sûreté Nationale, the French equivalent to Gestapo, suspects Morgan for being the one who brought two resistance fighters to Martinique and tries to press him to reveal their hiding place.

Their current client is an American fisherman named Johnson who grudgingly pulls out money to pay for gasoline for the boat, and who then ineptly loses two large marlins by not following Harry's orders. The second loss also includes all the tackle he was using. He tells Harry he is leaving Martinique in the morning and will pay him after he goes to the bank in the morning, because he doesn't have enough money on him.Back at the hotel, Gerard (Frenchy), who is the hotel owner and a member of the Free French resistance, comes to Harry's room and asks him to take on a smuggling job for the Free French Resistance movement. Suddenly a sultry young woman (Lauren Bacall) appears in his doorway asking for a match. Harry tosses her a box of matches and she leaves. Harry asks Frenchy who she is, and he says she came that afternoon on the plane from the south. Harry tells Frenchy he doesn't want any part of the movement or their activities.Later in the dining room he notices Marie with his American client, who acts too fresh for her taste. She brushes him off and goes to stand by the piano, where Cricket (Hoagy Carmichael) is playing and singing ""Am I Blue?"" She joins him in the verse and they harmonize well. Harry sees Marie pick up Johnson's wallet and leave the room. Frenchy stops at Harry's table and tells him he hasn't been able to head off the men who want to hire Harry's boat for the smuggling operation, and Harry tells him he'd better head them off. Harry follows Marie upstairs and stops her as she's entering her own room and makes her come with him into his room. He makes her hand over the wallet and finds it's full of traveller's checks and cash, enough to pay his bill, along with a plane reservation for earlier the next morning than Johnson had said he'd meet Harry to pay him. Harry is glad Slim (as he calls her), took the wallet and didn't return it after all. She says she needed money to leave Martinique.Frenchy comes to the door with his group of comrades who offer to pay Harry to pick up two people secretly from another Caribbean island and bring them back to Martinique. Eddie comes in during this business and asks the French resistance leader if he was ever stung by a dead bee. The man tries to shut Eddie up, but Slim takes up the question seriously, delighting Eddie and getting Harry's approval. Eddie leaves with a coin for a drink. Harry refuses to get involved, despite their pleadings. He leaves the room, taking Slim downstairs with him to confront Johnson and return his wallet and ask for the payment Johnson owes Harry. As Johnson is about to sign over the traveller's checks, the pro-Nazi French police open fire in the lounge at the resistance group that had come down from Harry's room, and Johnson gets killed by a stray bullet.Capt. M. Renard (Dan Seymour), the head of the local Gestapo, closes the hotel lounge and picks out four people for questioning--Frenchy, Harry, and Slim being three of the four. At the station, they confiscate Harry's money and passport and question everyone. Harry gets riled at the methods of questioning and fights back, then grabs Slim and tells her, ""Let's get out of here,"" which they do.Harry and Slim end up going to another bar, but they realize neither has any money, so Slim asks Harry if she should do her thing, and he says, ""Go right ahead."" She immediately turns on the flirtatious charm with a French officer there, and he gets up and starts dancing with her. Harry leaves, grinning. He knows she's ""good"" at what she does, but it begins to bother him.Later, she comes to his room with a bottle she has presumably charmed out of the man she was with, but Harry's reaction makes her feel cheap and she leaves, angry. He follows her across the hall to her room and they have it out. They have their first kiss, then another and, as she's leaving his room, she tells him to whistle if he needs anything. ""You know how to whistle, don't you Steve? You just put your lips together and . . . blow."" She shuts the door and he lets out a low wolf whistle.His American client dead without paying him, the rest of his money confiscated by the police, having refused Slim's last few dollars, Harry reluctantly takes the smuggling job. He's supposed to pick up the two Frenchmen from another island and deliver them back to Martinique in the middle of the night. He makes them pay him in advance, and he arranges a plane ticket for Slim for that afternoon to fly back to her home.Harry doesn't want to take Eddie with him into danger so he insults and slaps Eddie to keep him on shore while he goes out to pick up the Frenchmen. Eddie tricks him and smuggles himself aboard. Eddie comes out of hiding and confronts Harry, telling him he knew it was all a lie. Together they pick up their cargo which turns out to be a man and his wife, Paul and Hellene de Bursac (Walter Molnar and Dolores Moran). On the way back to Martinique they encounter a patrol boat and the Frenchman takes one in the shoulder. Harry shoots out the patrol boat's spotlight, and they head back to their destination in the foggy night waters.Harry and Eddie get the Frenchman and his wife back to Martinique. They find that Slim intentionally missed the plane home and has been hired to sing with Cricket and his combo. She helps Harry remove the bullet from de Bursac's shoulder while his wife makes demands and has hysterics and finally faints. Slim keeps her cool but is pointedly jealous of Madam de Bursac's flirting with Harry, and Harry's obvious response to her.Captain Renard tries to get Eddie drunk to find out where the Frenchman and his wife are. Harry intervenes and breaks up the questioning. It turns out that de Bursac is actually supposed to get a resistance leader off Devil's Island to help the cause, and he wishes he had Harry's courage. Soon afterward, Captain Renard again gets hold of Eddie, and tries to blackmail Harry into giving over the location of the Frenchman by threatening to withhold liquor from Eddie to make him go into delirium tremens and crack up. Harry gets a gun from his desk drawer and shoots one of Renard's henchmen and handcuffs the other and Renard. He beats them both until they agree to make the arrangements so that the de Bursacs, Harry, Eddie, and Slim can all leave the island for good.With everything fixed up, they gather in the hotel lounge where Slim wins over Eddie when she asks him, ""Was you ever stung by a dead bee?"" Eddie says she's all right and she goes over to say goodbye to Cricket who's playing piano. He asks her if she's happy, and Slim says ""What do you think?"" doing a dance back over to her ""Steve.""

                    Dr. Niemann regales his hunchbacked cellmate, Daniel, with tales of how he had nearly put the brain of a human into a dog. This gives Daniel hope. If brain switches are possible, that would mean his own brain could be removed to a better home than the misshapen body he's now trapped in. A thunderstorm destroys their prison, and they escape to find refuge in the company of a traveling carnival. The carnival owner has possession of the skeleton of Count Dracula, who can be revived by removing the wooden stake from the area of his heart. Niemann has the hunchback kill the owner, and then resurrects Dracula to kill those who had sent him to prison. But Dracula has other plans. Later, Niemann and the hunchback encounter a gypsy caravan where Daniel falls in love with a beautiful gypsy girl. She travels with them to Frankenstein's ruined castle, where they find Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man frozen in ice. Niemann thaws them out, finding the Monster fairly inert and the Wolf Man changed back to the tormented Larry Talbot.

                    1943. US Army Captain Timothy Hilton going into service from a civilian life leaves his wife Anne Hilton, his seventeen year old daughter Jane Hilton and his preteen daughter Brig Hilton at home needing to adjust to a new life without him. With a reduced income, Anne is forced to let go of their faithful maid Fidelia, who nonetheless finds a way back into the house based on always being in the Hiltons' hearts, and take in a boarder. Wanting an officer to replace the officer that left, Anne lets the room to retired General William G. Smollett, an uncompromising man who doesn't like children and doesn't like dogs, mostly the Hiltons' bulldog Soda who seems to have taken a liking to him regardless. That uncompromising behavior is exemplified by his outward dislike of his paternal grandson, Corporal Bill Smollett - who he assumes hates him in return - as slightly awkward Bill, despite being an army brat and currently in the military, has never shown the aptitude of being an officer like him or Bill's now deceased father. Brig does her small part for the war effort, such as collecting junk as salvage. However, Jane, who is just reaching womanhood, cannot think of anything but men, fixating most specifically on longtime family friend, her father's best man Tony Willett, who she and Brig have always referred to as ""Uncle"". Jane is at that stage in her life of transferring that affection she had for adults when she was younger mistakenly now into romantic love. Like Tim, Tony, an artist by trade, has entered the service as a Lieutenant in the Navy. In her fixation on Tony, Jane cannot see that Bill in turn is in love with her. As the war progresses, as people they know leave town to go into service - some into active battle - and as potential and actual personal tragedy hits people they know and themselves, Anne, General Smollett, Jane and Brig will have to make further adjustments to survive emotionally, with Jane and Brig perhaps growing up in the process for good or bad.

While walking home, Velvet meets young drifter Mi Taylor and strikes up a conversation with him. As the horse-crazy girl is talking to Mi, she sees a beautiful, rambunctious gelding being chased by its owner, farmer Ede, and is awestruck. When Ede then questions Mi about his business in Sewels in Sussex, Velvet, who is impressed by Mi's knowledge of horses, insists that he has been invited to dine with her family.That evening at dinner, Mrs. Brown asks Mi, whom she has never before met, about an address book with her name written in it, and he reveals that it belonged to his now-deceased father. Although Mrs. Brown is deliberately secretive about her relationship with Mi's father, she does invite Mi to spend the night in the stable. Velvet then tries in vain to convince her father Herbert, a butcher who prides himself on his thrift and self-control, to hire Mi as a delivery boy. When he and his wife discuss the matter later, however, the wise, persuasive Mrs. Brown easily changes his mind.Later, Velvet confesses to her mother that she has ""fallen in love"" with The Pie and asks her about Mi's father. Mrs. Brown, a former swimmer, reveals that when she was twenty, Mi's father was her devoted trainer and inspired her to swim the English Channel, a feat never before accomplished by a woman. Mrs. Brown adds that she declined to tell the obviously embittered Mi about his father because she felt that it was not the proper time to do so. Unaware that he has just stolen all of her mother's savings from the kitchen, Velvet rushes to tell Mi the news about his new job and home. Mi covers up his theft and accepts the job, then, chagrined, sneaks back to the kitchen to return the money.Later, Velvet coaxes Mi into taking her on a delivery to farmer Ede's, and on the way, Mi states that he was once thrown by a horse and now hates them. As they are watching The Pie in the field, the horse jumps Ede's wall and dashes off toward town. After estimating the length of the horse's jump, the astounded Mi mutters that The Pie could jump ""Beecher's Brook."" The Pie's subsequent rampage through the village leads Ede to decide to raffle off the horse. Mr. Brown at first refuses to allow Velvet to participate in the raffle, but when Mi proudly announces that he has bought tickets for all of the children, Mr. Brown relents. Although Velvet confidently proclaims that her number, 62, is going to be selected, another number is drawn, and Velvet collapses with disappointment. Later, however, Velvet learns that when the winning number was not claimed, a second number, 62, was drawn, and she is awarded The Pie.Velvet then asks Mi about ""Beecher's Brook"" and he reluctantly reveals that it is a difficult jump at the Grand National Steeplechase course. Velvet spends her first day with The Pie racing through the countryside, but her joy is cut short when her father insists that the horse earn his keep by pulling the delivery cart. As soon as he is hitched, however, The Pie bolts and destroys the cart, causing Mr. Brown to denounce Mi as a meddler.Later, Velvet reveals to Mi that she wrote away to the Aintree race course for entrance papers to the Grand National Steeplechase. Although Mi tries to discourage her, Velvet asks her mother for permission to enter the race, which includes a 100-pound entrance fee. After Mi admits that The Pie is good enough to win, Mrs. Brown gives Velvet the 100 pounds she earned for her Channel swim, which she has been saving in anticipation of a ""breath-taking piece of folly"" like The Pie. Mrs. Brown and Velvet then entrust Mi to deliver the money to Aintree, and although he is tempted to abscond with it while in London, Mi carries out his assignment, impressing even Mr. Brown. When Mi tells Velvet that he was unable to find a jockey or a trainer in London, she persuades him to train the horse by promising him one-half of any Grand National winnings. Over the next several months, Velvet and Mi, a former jockey, rigorously train The Pie.During the winter, The Pie becomes seriously ill, and the entire Brown family worries as Mi struggles to save him. The Pie survives, and come spring, Velvet and Mi leave for Aintree. There they meet with Ivan Taski, a Latvian jockey whom Mi hired through the mail. Taski's lackluster attitude toward the race convinces both Velvet and Mi that they cannot win with him, and on the eve of the contest, they find themselves with no jockey. Velvet then tries to convince Mi to ride The Pie, but he tearfully refuses, explaining that during a race in Manchester, he pushed his horse too hard and caused a collision that resulted in the death of another jockey.

    Synopsis
    In the English coastal village of Sewels in Sussex, 12-year-old Velvet Brown and her older sisters, Edwina and Malvolia, happily finish their last day of school before summer vacation. While walking home, Velvet meets young drifter Mi Taylor and strikes up a conversation with him. As the horse-crazy girl is talking to Mi, she sees a beautiful, rambunctious gelding being chased by its owner, farmer Ede, and is awestruck. When Ede then questions Mi about his business in Sewels in Sussex, Velvet, who is impressed by Mi's knowledge of horses, insists that he has been invited to dine with her family.That evening at dinner, Mrs. Brown asks Mi, whom she has never before met, about an address book with her name written in it, and he reveals that it belonged to his now-deceased father. Although Mrs. Brown is deliberately secretive about her relationship with Mi's father, she does invite Mi to spend the night in the stable. Velvet then tries in vain to convince her father Herbert, a butcher who prides himself on his thrift and self-control, to hire Mi as a delivery boy. When he and his wife discuss the matter later, however, the wise, persuasive Mrs. Brown easily changes his mind.Later, Velvet confesses to her mother that she has ""fallen in love"" with The Pie and asks her about Mi's father. Mrs. Brown, a former swimmer, reveals that when she was twenty, Mi's father was her devoted trainer and inspired her to swim the English Channel, a feat never before accomplished by a woman. Mrs. Brown adds that she declined to tell the obviously embittered Mi about his father because she felt that it was not the proper time to do so. Unaware that he has just stolen all of her mother's savings from the kitchen, Velvet rushes to tell Mi the news about his new job and home. Mi covers up his theft and accepts the job, then, chagrined, sneaks back to the kitchen to return the money.Later, Velvet coaxes Mi into taking her on a delivery to farmer Ede's, and on the way, Mi states that he was once thrown by a horse and now hates them. As they are watching The Pie in the field, the horse jumps Ede's wall and dashes off toward town. After estimating the length of the horse's jump, the astounded Mi mutters that The Pie could jump ""Beecher's Brook.""

                    This adaptation of the Raymond Chandler novel 'Farewell, My Lovely', renamed for the American market to prevent filmgoers mistaking it for a musical (for which Powell was already famous) has private eye Philip Marlowe hired by Moose Malloy, a petty crook just out of prison after a seven year stretch, to look for his former girlfriend, Velma, who has not been seen for the last six years. The case is tougher than Marlowe expected as his initially promising enquiries lead to a complex web of deceit involving bribery, perjury and theft, and where no one's motivation is obvious, least of all Marlowe's.

                    With his eyes bandaged due to injury, Los Angeles based private investigator Philip Marlowe is under police interrogation as a murder suspect. Marlowe tells them the story as he knows... In quick succession, he is hired by two different clients for two potentially lucrative cases. The first client is hulking Moose Malloy, an ex-con who hires him to find his ex-fiancée Velma Valento, of who he lost track while he was in prison for eight years. The second client is Lindsay Marriott, who hires him for a one night job, to accompany him to Laurel Canyon to act as the go-between to repurchase some jewels that were stolen from a friend. Marlowe later learns that friend is Helen Grayle, the young second wife of wealthy sixty-five year old Leuwen Grayle, and the jewels are a jade necklace worth approximately $100,000 that Mr. Grayle, a jade collector, gave to her as a gift. In meeting the Grayles, Marlowe also meets Mr. Grayle's daughter, Ann Grayle, who detests her stepmother. Ann goes as far as secretly advising Marlowe not to associate with Helen, and will pay him to do so. Marlowe also discovers that Marriott is associated with a self-described ""quack"", a psychic consultant named Jules Amthor, who is known to the police. The two cases start to intersect in ways Marlowe never expect. When one of the players is found murdered, Marlowe has to piece together who is the one manipulating the situation to his/her benefit to discover who committed that murder. The last piece in him being able to do so is how the jade necklace fits into the picture...

                    Rusty Parker, a red-headed leggy dancer at Danny McGuire's Night Club in Brooklyn, wants to be a successful Broadway star. She enters a contest to be a 'Cover Girl' as a stepping-stone in her career. She reminds the publisher, John Coudair, of his lost love, showgirl Maribelle Hicks. He was engaged to Maribelle, although his wealthy society mother made fun of her. Maribelle left John at the altar when she saw the piano at her wedding. It reminded her of the piano-player she truly loved. Rusty is Maribelle's granddaughter and there are musical sequences with Maribelle dancing to songs from the beginning of the 20th century. Rusty lands on the cover of her grandmother's former fiancé's magazine (as a bride). She is pursued by Coudair's pal, the wealthy theatrical producer, Noel Wheaton. He produces a lavish musical to star Rusty, surrounded by real cover girls of the mid 1940's. Rusty runs down a huge spiral into the arms of dozens of men who seem clumsy next to her ethereal dancing. But her success threatens Danny McGuire. He expressed his distress that his girlfriend will find success without him in Kelly's famous dance with himself, 'Alter Ego'. He and his sidekick, Genius, leave New York and entertain soldiers fighting in World War II. Rusty agrees to marry Noel, dazzled by success, security, and his power and money. But she drinks and loses weight because her heart belongs to Danny. She receives a symbolic pearl with great power and tells Coudair and Wheaton that she must spend her life with the man she loves.

                    Youthful Father Chuck O'Malley led a colorful life of sports, song, and romance before joining the Roman Catholic clergy, but his level gaze and twinkling eyes make it clear that he knows he made the right choice. After joining a parish, O'Malley's worldly knowledge helps him connect with a gang of kids looking for direction and handle the business details of the church-building fund, winning over his aging, conventional superior, Father Fitzgibbon.

                    Father Fitzgibbon has been the parish priest at St. Dominic's in New York City for forty five years. The parish faces financial and social problems which the diocese believes cannot be solved by Father Fitzgibbon's traditional and conservative approach to running the parish. The bishop appoints progressive Father O'Malley, originally from St. Louis, to, on the surface, assist Father Fitzgibbon at St. Dominic's. In reality, Father O'Malley has been appointed to lead the parish out of these problems, something that Father Fitzgibbon is unaware, and something that Father O'Malley does not want to divulge in letting Father Fitzgibbon continue his work in dignity. Father O'Malley's task is made all the more difficult as Father Fitzgibbon does not approve of Father O'Malley's ways, both as priest and as a person. In general, Father Fitzgibbon takes a rather strict approach typical to the traditional ways of the church, whereas Father O'Malley takes a more compassionate humanistic approach, he who wants to bring people back to the church through more contemporary means rather than the old ""fire and brimstone"" preachings. However, even Father O'Malley's humanism may not be able to deal with the fact that Ted Haines Sr., representing the Knickerbocker Savings and Loan, is thinking of foreclosing on the church's mortgage for non-payment, money which the church does not have and which it needs to get out of this problem.

                    As French bomber crews prepare an air raid from a base in England, we learn the story of Matrac, a French journalist who opposed the Munich Pact. Framed for murder and sent to Devil's Island, he and four others escape. They are on a ship bound for Marseilles when France surrenders and fascist sympathizer Major Duval tries to seize the ship for Vichy.

                    While visiting a Free French bomber squadron in England, a journalist learns from Captain Freycinet the story of some of the men. Just at the outset of World War II, 5 men were found floating in a raft by a passing freighter. The five of them had escaped from Devil's Island and Freycinet knows their individual stories well as he was on board the freighter, en route to Marseilles. Four of the men had committed crimes, some serious, some not so serious. One of them however, Jean Matrac, was falsely accused of murder, a political set-up for having criticized the French government. They managed to escape from their island prison with the help of an old man, a former prisoner who, like the escapees he's helped, a patriot at heart. The freighter receives word while still at sea that France has signed an armistice with the Nazis and the ship's captain changes course for England. Matrac desperately wants to get back the loving wife he's left behind but in war, nothing turns out as you would hope.

"24","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037099/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey then pledges his devotion:""I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world and by the dread horror of Set, that I shall never forsake my trust as a Priest of Arkham. Nor shall I rest until the Princess Ananka and Kharis are safe once more in the Hills of Arkham.""Andoheb explains that each night during the cycle of the full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from 9 tana leaves and that wherever Kharis is, the Mummy will sense this and find the leaves. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on the case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing 9 tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that.The battered, ragged form of Kharis now appears, his right arm is useless and held in a sling, his right eye burned and sealed shut. He senses the leaves brewing and begins instinctively heading toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and his presence arouses her from a fitful sleep. She wanders outside in a trance-like state. She does not see Kharis, who is now some distance ahead, but somehow follows the same course. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman and enters his study. Norman looks up and is shocked to see the Mummy shambling toward him with one arm extending, reaching for the Professor's throat. Soundlessly and brutally, Kharis strangles Norman and then drinks the fluid of the tana leaves.Amina now approaches and Kharis senses her presence and heads back outside. From a concealed location, Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to immediately faint. She falls to the ground with a strange birthmark now apparent on her wrist.The next morning, Tom Hervey learns that Professor Norman was murdered and that Amina was found at the scene and detained. He immediately heads for the Professor's home. At the home, Sherriff Elwood (Harry Shannon) and the Coroner (Emmett Vogan) investigate the scene of the crime. They discover a strange mold around the Professor's throat; a sign they both know to mean that the Mummy stalks Mapleton again. The Sherrif questions Amina, who has developed a white streak in her hair overnight. Amina is dazed and confused, but Elwood continues to grill her until Hervey arrives. Tom unsuccessfully tries to provide an alibi for Amina and the Sherrif maintains his suspicions in her involvement. Elwood finally dismisses the pair but gives Amina the obligatory warning not to leave the area. Tom takes her home to comfort her but is himself disturbed by the changes in her appearance.Panic begins to grip the town as newspaper reports of the killing highlight the involvement of the Egyptian woman and the speculation that the Mummy has returned. Townspeople are warned to stay indoors at night and all able-bodied men are asked to help patrol the streets after dark.Weeks later Yousef Bey, who has arrived in Mapleton, calls on Amon-Ra to aid him in his quest and begins to brew the sacred fluid of the tana leaves to summon Kharis. Kharis, indeed, senses the leaves and heads toward them. Tom and Amina are out for a drive that same night. Amina is finally beginning to return to normal, laughing and no longer hearing voices or suffering from fevers and chills. Unseen, Kharis passes near them, causing Amina's mood to suddenly change and for her to feel an unnatural cold. Despite Tom professing his love for her, Amina cannot shake the strange feeling and asks to be taken home.Kharis continues on his quest for the tana leaves, passing through the Evans farm. The family dog is startled by his presence and begins to bark incessantly. Mr. Evans (Eddy Waller), armed with a shot gun, comes out of the house to investigate and is surprised by Kharis. Evans fires his weapon at the Mummy to no avail. Kharis swiftly murders the man and busts through the wall of the barn, undeterred from his quest. The Sherrif soon arrives on the scene and, recognizing the evidence of Kharis, plans to organize a search party. Kharis, meanwhile, finds Yousef Bey and consumes the life-giving tana leaves. Yousef thanks his god for his success thus far and re-pledges his devotion to their mission.The next day, at the Scripps Museum, Yousef Bey lags behind a tour group viewing the Mummy of Ananka. He asks Amon-Ra for forgiveness for allowing these heretics to view the sacred remains of the Princess. After closing time, Yousef emerges from a hiding place as Kharis breaks into the museum. The two are excited with anticipation as their mission appears near an end. Yousef encourages Kharis by telling him the Tombs of Arkham are waiting to claim their own. Kharis attempts to touch the mummified body, but it disintegrates under the wrapping as his hand approaches. At that same moment, Amina, miles away in her home, awakens screaming. Yousef Bey realizes that Ananka's soul has been re-incarnated into another form. Kharis is enraged and begins destroying the exhibit, attracting the museum security guard (Oscar O'Shea). The guard enters, not seeing Kharis, and draws his gun on the High Priest. The Mummy exits the shadows and moves toward the horrified man. He fires several shot at point blank range, but the Mummy is not even slowed. Kharis crushes his throat as Yousef Bey looks on with glee. Yousef Bey realizes that the two must still fulfill their mission and find the new vessel holding Ananka's soul and return it to Egypt.Tom Hervey visits Sherrif Elwood, seeking permission to take Amina away to New York to restore her health. Elwood says he is not trying to implicate Amina in the murders, but denies Hervey's request. At the Scripps Museum, the body of the guard is found and the tell-tale marks of mold identify the killer as Kharis. Police Inspector Walgreen (Barton MacLane) and Dr. Ayad (Lester Sharpe) from the museum are bewildered as to how Ananka's body has disappeared without disturbing the wrappings. Dr. Ayad translates the markings on the tomb for the Inspector:""Herein rests the body of Ananka, third daughter of Amenophis. In the Hills of Arkham shall Ananka lie in the tomb appointed for her and in none other, because freed from its resting place, her soul may find reincarnation in another form, again to seek out its salvation on earth.""The Inspector is skeptical but asks the Doctor to accompany him to Mapleton to investigate further. Upon arriving, they seek out the assistance of Sherrif Elwood and the group convenes at the home of the late Professor Norman. Dr. Ayad translates most of the markings on the cask of tana leaves and Inspector Walgreen decides to use the leaves to attract and capture Kharis. Since bullets are useless against the Mummy, the plan is to build a pit to confine the creature until a way to deal with him can be found.Amina is still unable to shake the haunted feelings that torture her. Tom, disregarding the Sherrif's warnings, asks Amina to elope with him to New York. Amina tries to discourage him but Tom is insistent. She agrees and the two make plans to leave early the next morning. Tom leaves Amina in the care of her guardian, Mrs. Blake (Dorothy Vaughan) and Tom's faithful dog, Peanuts.Yousef Bey calls upon Amon Ra to lead him to the new home of Ananka's soul. Just then, a window blows open and Yousef sees the moon, which resembles the scene on the ceremonial amulet he wears as a Priest of Arkham. Knowing that this is a sign from the gods, he sends Kharis in that direction to find Ananka.Using the widowed Mrs. Norman's (Claire Whitney) recollections as a guide, Inspector Walgreen now begins to bait his trap by burning nine tana leaves. Kharis immediately senses this, and heads toward the Norman home--a course that takes him directly past Amina's home. Amina is awakened by his approach and hypnotically wanders into the yard. Kharis sees her and recognizes her as the carrier of Ananka's soul. Amina faints as Kharis picks her up and takes her away.The abduction is witnessed by Mrs. Blake, who phones Tom to alert him. Tom immediately sets out in pursuit. Mrs. Blake, then heads to the Norman house and tells her story to Inspector Walgreen, Sherrif Elwood and a large group of volunteers. A frantic chase now ensues. Kharis and Amina are headed for the old mill where Yousef Bey waits. Tom, led by Peanuts, is hot on their trail, while further back is the mob. Kharis arrives at the mill and presents Amina to Yousef Bey. Bey recognizes the birthmark on her wrist as the symbol of the Priests of Arkham. Amina awakens and the Priest informs her that she is, indeed, the reincarnation of Ananka. Amina denies this but Yousef Bey warns her:""For those who defy the will of the ancient gods, a cruel and violent death shall be their fate, never shall they find rest unto eternity.""Yousef Bey now begins to admire Amina's beauty and feels the pangs of temptation to keep her alive as his bride. His devotion begins to falter as they are thousands of miles from the Tombs of Arkham and Ananka is thousands of years from her sin. He calls upon Isis to protect him in his hour of temptation, but his prayers go unanswered. He decides to use the tana leaves to keep Amina young and beautiful forever. The two will drink the fluid and become immortal and never return to Egypt. This enrages Kharis and before Yousef Bey can give her the fluid, the Mummy knocks the cup away. He exacts his vengeance on the Priest with a killing blow, delivered with enough force to fling Yousef's lifeless body through the window and onto the ground below.Tom Hervey now arrives and witnesses the death of the Priest. He rushes up the stairs to the mill but is met by Kharis. A struggle ensues and Tom is quickly overwhelmed. Kharis returns to retrieve Amina, whose hair is now completely white. The mob now approaches and they revive Tom, as Kharis attempts to escape with Amina. Once again led by Peanuts, the mob pursues the Mummy and his Princess into the neary swamps. In Kharis's arms, Amina/Ananka is now aging rapidly. They are chased deeper and deeper into the swamps and now begin to sink into the bog. Tom's last anguished sight of Amina is that of a 3,000 year old Egyptian Princess. Kharis and Ananka disappear under the water, united in death.","

They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey then pledges his devotion:""I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world and by the dread horror of Set, that I shall never forsake my trust as a Priest of Arkham. Nor shall I rest until the Princess Ananka and Kharis are safe once more in the Hills of Arkham.""Andoheb explains that each night during the cycle of the full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from 9 tana leaves and that wherever Kharis is, the Mummy will sense this and find the leaves. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on the case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing 9 tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that.The battered, ragged form of Kharis now appears, his right arm is useless and held in a sling, his right eye burned and sealed shut. He senses the leaves brewing and begins instinctively heading toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and his presence arouses her from a fitful sleep. She wanders outside in a trance-like state. She does not see Kharis, who is now some distance ahead, but somehow follows the same course. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman and enters his study. Norman looks up and is shocked to see the Mummy shambling toward him with one arm extending, reaching for the Professor's throat. Soundlessly and brutally, Kharis strangles Norman and then drinks the fluid of the tana leaves.Amina now approaches and Kharis senses her presence and heads back outside. From a concealed location, Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to immediately faint. She falls to the ground with a strange birthmark now apparent on her wrist.The next morning, Tom Hervey learns that Professor Norman was murdered and that Amina was found at the scene and detained. He immediately heads for the Professor's home. At the home, Sherriff Elwood (Harry Shannon) and the Coroner (Emmett Vogan) investigate the scene of the crime. They discover a strange mold around the Professor's throat; a sign they both know to mean that the Mummy stalks Mapleton again. The Sherrif questions Amina, who has developed a white streak in her hair overnight. Amina is dazed and confused, but Elwood continues to grill her until Hervey arrives. Tom unsuccessfully tries to provide an alibi for Amina and the Sherrif maintains his suspicions in her involvement. Elwood finally dismisses the pair but gives Amina the obligatory warning not to leave the area. Tom takes her home to comfort her but is himself disturbed by the changes in her appearance.Panic begins to grip the town as newspaper reports of the killing highlight the involvement of the Egyptian woman and the speculation that the Mummy has returned. Townspeople are warned to stay indoors at night and all able-bodied men are asked to help patrol the streets after dark.Weeks later Yousef Bey, who has arrived in Mapleton, calls on Amon-Ra to aid him in his quest and begins to brew the sacred fluid of the tana leaves to summon Kharis. Kharis, indeed, senses the leaves and heads toward them. Tom and Amina are out for a drive that same night. Amina is finally beginning to return to normal, laughing and no longer hearing voices or suffering from fevers and chills. Unseen, Kharis passes near them, causing Amina's mood to suddenly change and for her to feel an unnatural cold. Despite Tom professing his love for her, Amina cannot shake the strange feeling and asks to be taken home.Kharis continues on his quest for the tana leaves, passing through the Evans farm. The family dog is startled by his presence and begins to bark incessantly. Mr. Evans (Eddy Waller), armed with a shot gun, comes out of the house to investigate and is surprised by Kharis. Evans fires his weapon at the Mummy to no avail. Kharis swiftly murders the man and busts through the wall of the barn, undeterred from his quest. The Sherrif soon arrives on the scene and, recognizing the evidence of Kharis, plans to organize a search party. Kharis, meanwhile, finds Yousef Bey and consumes the life-giving tana leaves. Yousef thanks his god for his success thus far and re-pledges his devotion to their mission.The next day, at the Scripps Museum, Yousef Bey lags behind a tour group viewing the Mummy of Ananka. He asks Amon-Ra for forgiveness for allowing these heretics to view the sacred remains of the Princess. After closing time, Yousef emerges from a hiding place as Kharis breaks into the museum. The two are excited with anticipation as their mission appears near an end. Yousef encourages Kharis by telling him the Tombs of Arkham are waiting to claim their own. Kharis attempts to touch the mummified body, but it disintegrates under the wrapping as his hand approaches. At that same moment, Amina, miles away in her home, awakens screaming. Yousef Bey realizes that Ananka's soul has been re-incarnated into another form. Kharis is enraged and begins destroying the exhibit, attracting the museum security guard (Oscar O'Shea). The guard enters, not seeing Kharis, and draws his gun on the High Priest. The Mummy exits the shadows and moves toward the horrified man. He fires several shot at point blank range, but the Mummy is not even slowed. Kharis crushes his throat as Yousef Bey looks on with glee. Yousef Bey realizes that the two must still fulfill their mission and find the new vessel holding Ananka's soul and return it to Egypt.Tom Hervey visits Sherrif Elwood, seeking permission to take Amina away to New York to restore her health. Elwood says he is not trying to implicate Amina in the murders, but denies Hervey's request. At the Scripps Museum, the body of the guard is found and the tell-tale marks of mold identify the killer as Kharis. Police Inspector Walgreen (Barton MacLane) and Dr. Ayad (Lester Sharpe) from the museum are bewildered as to how Ananka's body has disappeared without disturbing the wrappings. Dr. Ayad translates the markings on the tomb for the Inspector:""Herein rests the body of Ananka, third daughter of Amenophis. In the Hills of Arkham shall Ananka lie in the tomb appointed for her and in none other, because freed from its resting place, her soul may find reincarnation in another form, again to seek out its salvation on earth.""The Inspector is skeptical but asks the Doctor to accompany him to Mapleton to investigate further. Upon arriving, they seek out the assistance of Sherrif Elwood and the group convenes at the home of the late Professor Norman. Dr. Ayad translates most of the markings on the cask of tana leaves and Inspector Walgreen decides to use the leaves to attract and capture Kharis. Since bullets are useless against the Mummy, the plan is to build a pit to confine the creature until a way to deal with him can be found.Amina is still unable to shake the haunted feelings that torture her. Tom, disregarding the Sherrif's warnings, asks Amina to elope with him to New York. Amina tries to discourage him but Tom is insistent. She agrees and the two make plans to leave early the next morning. Tom leaves Amina in the care of her guardian, Mrs. Blake (Dorothy Vaughan) and Tom's faithful dog, Peanuts.Yousef Bey calls upon Amon Ra to lead him to the new home of Ananka's soul. Just then, a window blows open and Yousef sees the moon, which resembles the scene on the ceremonial amulet he wears as a Priest of Arkham. Knowing that this is a sign from the gods, he sends Kharis in that direction to find Ananka.Using the widowed Mrs. Norman's (Claire Whitney) recollections as a guide, Inspector Walgreen now begins to bait his trap by burning nine tana leaves. Kharis immediately senses this, and heads toward the Norman home--a course that takes him directly past Amina's home. Amina is awakened by his approach and hypnotically wanders into the yard. Kharis sees her and recognizes her as the carrier of Ananka's soul. Amina faints as Kharis picks her up and takes her away.The abduction is witnessed by Mrs. Blake, who phones Tom to alert him. Tom immediately sets out in pursuit. Mrs. Blake, then heads to the Norman house and tells her story to Inspector Walgreen, Sherrif Elwood and a large group of volunteers. A frantic chase now ensues. Kharis and Amina are headed for the old mill where Yousef Bey waits. Tom, led by Peanuts, is hot on their trail, while further back is the mob. Kharis arrives at the mill and presents Amina to Yousef Bey. Bey recognizes the birthmark on her wrist as the symbol of the Priests of Arkham. Amina awakens and the Priest informs her that she is, indeed, the reincarnation of Ananka. Amina denies this but Yousef Bey warns her:""For those who defy the will of the ancient gods, a cruel and violent death shall be their fate, never shall they find rest unto eternity.""Yousef Bey now begins to admire Amina's beauty and feels the pangs of temptation to keep her alive as his bride. His devotion begins to falter as they are thousands of miles from the Tombs of Arkham and Ananka is thousands of years from her sin. He calls upon Isis to protect him in his hour of temptation, but his prayers go unanswered. He decides to use the tana leaves to keep Amina young and beautiful forever. The two will drink the fluid and become immortal and never return to Egypt. This enrages Kharis and before Yousef Bey can give her the fluid, the Mummy knocks the cup away. He exacts his vengeance on the Priest with a killing blow, delivered with enough force to fling Yousef's lifeless body through the window and onto the ground below.Tom Hervey now arrives and witnesses the death of the Priest. He rushes up the stairs to the mill but is met by Kharis. A struggle ensues and Tom is quickly overwhelmed. Kharis returns to retrieve Amina, whose hair is now completely white. The mob now approaches and they revive Tom, as Kharis attempts to escape with Amina. Once again led by Peanuts, the mob pursues the Mummy and his Princess into the neary swamps. In Kharis's arms, Amina/Ananka is now aging rapidly. They are chased deeper and deeper into the swamps and now begin to sink into the bog. Tom's last anguished sight of Amina is that of a 3,000 year old Egyptian Princess. Kharis and Ananka disappear under the water, united in death.

""The Ruptured Duck"" has trouble starting, but a determined Ted gets the engine going just in time. Although its left engine is misfiring, ""The Ruptured Duck"" drops its bombs over Tokyo and heads for the free Chinese coast, where crude airstrips have been built.As they are flying there, however, a storm blows in, causing Ted to crash-land just short of the beach. The plane sinks, but the crew swims to shore. All but David are injured, and Ted's leg is severely cut. Soon after, sympathetic Chinese villagers appear and carry the Americans to safety. Ted and the others are befriended by a Chinese resistance fighter nicknamed ""Guerilla Charlie,"" who helps them to a small town. There Dr. Chung attends to the men's wounds, but as he has no medicine, orders that they be carried to his father's hospital 16 miles away.With the Japanese Army not far behind, the men reach the hospital and learn that another crew has been rescued and is on its way there. Although the two crews enjoy their reunion, Ted is told that his leg, which has developed gangrene, must be amputated. While recalling happier days with Ellen, the near-delirious Ted faces the operation with courage. Later, having recovered enough to be moved, Ted is evacuated to Chungking along with the other injured men.After thanking their Chinese rescuers, who helped save many other Americans, including Bob, the crew of ""The Ruptured Duck"" returns to the U.S. Ellen then receives a phone call from Doolittle and learns about Ted's injury and his refusal to see her until he has received his artificial leg. Urged by Doolittle and her mother, the now visibly pregnant Ellen goes to see Ted at the hospital and, after reassuring him that she is still very much in love, embraces him.

                    In 1937, the Tan family are hard working and prosperous farmers living in Southern China, they who are unwise to the ways outside of their day-to-day lives. The area has not yet been directly affected by the Sino-Japanese War taking place in the north, although local students warn of its impending arrival. One who takes their heed is Jade Tan, one of the Tan's daughters-in-law, who is an independent thinking woman and who aspires to be a learned person, and not just fill the traditional role of being merely a servant to her husband, Lao Er Tan. When the Japanese finally come knocking on their doorsteps, the Tans, collectively and individually, must decide what best to do, especially without access to guns or other such weapons. Among the Tan family includes their only son-in-law Wu Lien, a wealthy merchant who was once targeted by the local students for selling Japanese goods - which he did unabashedly - and thus was seen as indirectly supporting the Japanese war effort. By this time, Jade and Lao Er have joined a migrant group assisting the Chinese war effort. They hope to be able to bring news back to their family on how best to combat the enemy threat, even if it goes against father Ling Tan's pacifist nature, and ideals of family unity and agrarian life.

Though Mr. Bonting is unhappy over the idea of letting rooms, it seems an answer to a prayer when a peculiar young man named Mr. Slade rents both a room and the attic. He even pays twenty pounds in advance. But he is peculiar. He claims to be conducting scientific experiments, which is supposed to explain why he is out at all hours and why he can be found in the attic burning things. His antipathy toward actresses is particularly strange. The walls of his room have paintings of actresses, and the first thing he does is turn them all to the wall. Mrs. Bonting's niece happens to live in the house, too. And she's a music-hall actress. None of this would seem particularly alarming. But Jack the Ripper is on the loose. And all his victims are connected in some way to the stage. And no one knows who he is.

Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside, Scottland. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from March 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins.One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic Scottish mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is now a young adult leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm ""Angus"" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Catholic Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest.Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, ""the faith left them when the rice gave out."" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same ""rice Christians"" who were supposed to help him.A local man named Joseph (Benson Fong) hears Francis is in town, and offers to help him rebuild the church out of Christian duty and not for money. Francis then receives medical supplies from his childhood friend Dr. Willie Tulloch (Thomas Mitchell), which allows Francis to offer services to the sick. Francis is summoned to the home of local official, Mr. Chia (Leonard Strong), to heal Chia's only son of his infection. Joseph is apprehensive because if Chia's son dies, Francis will be in danger, but Francis goes anyway. He saves the boy, but Chia and his household are ungrateful because Francis' methods and faith were so contrary to the local tradition. A few weeks later, Chia comes to Francis in order to covert to Christianity, but Francis rejects him because he would not be converting for the proper reasons. Instead, Chia thanks Francis by giving the mission many acres of land and all of Chia's workers in order to build a thriving mission.Two years later, the buildings are almost done, but the nuns arrive a day earlier than planned and Francis is disheveled when they show up. Francis' relationship with the Reverend Mother Maria-Veronica (Rose Stradner) is tense, but they put aside personal differences when the town is the scene of a battle between republic and imperial troops. Willie visits from Scotland and is able to create a makeshift hospital, but the church is destroyed in a fire set by imperial troops. Willie is then shot, and eventually dies. The imperial general then gives Francis a choice: either all food and money from the mission are given to the general or the mission and everyone inside of it is destroyed. Joseph and Francis come up with a plan to sabotage the imperial troops, and Francis is forced to leave his impartiality and blows up the imperial troops.Later, Angus arrives -- now a Monsignor -- as he is making a review of world missionary sites. He tells Francis that the Church cannot pay for the rebuilding of the mission, and that Francis has the lowest conversion rates in the world. Angus implores Francis to convert rich Chinese and live in luxury in order to impress the locals, but Francis refuses. Meanwhile, the Reverend Mother apologizes for her ""shameful"" behavior towards Francis and begs for forgiveness, which she receives.Ten years pass, and Francis' mission is flourishing. The church is full of true Christians, and the town is peaceful. The Reverend Mother tells Francis that American Methodists are building a mission inside town, and Francis goes to visit them. Francis becomes friends with the Methodist missionaries, and peace continues. More years pass, and as Francis prepares to depart China, he learns that Angus is now Bishop.The flashback ends, and Monsignor Sleeth admits to Francis that he read the diary. Francis is flattered, and Sleeth tells Francis that he won't tell the Bishop anything is amiss at Francis' parish, leaving Francis be as he spends his remaining time doing what he loves doing: serving a parish.","
    
                    A young priest, Father Chisholm is sent to China to establish a Catholic parish among the non-Christian Chinese. While his boyhood friend, also a priest, flourishes in his calling as a priest in a more Christian area of the world, Father Chisholm struggles. He encounters hostility, isolation, disease, poverty and a variety of set backs which humble him, but make him more determined than ever to succeed. Over the span of many years he gains acceptance and a growing congregation among the Chinese, through his quiet determination, understanding and patience.

The Monsignor who has delivered the message comes across Father Francis' journals which tell his life story. He is orphaned when his parents are swept down down river during a violent storm and taken in by his Aunt Polly. After the death of his childhood sweetheart, he enters the priesthood and is sent by his mentor, Bishop Hamish MacNabb, as a missionary to China. He arrives to find that his church has burnt to the ground and that he has few adherents other than rice Christians, a practice he puts to an immediate end. Establishing himself is a challenge but he is called to care for the son of the local Mandarin. As a thank you, the Mandarin gives him a piece of land and pays all of the expenses to build a new compound with not only a church but a schoolhouse and a dispensary. The arrival of three nuns should have lightened his load but his inability to befriend the haughty Mother Superior weighs greatly on his conscience. They survive a war between Imperial and Nationalist troops but a close friend is killed. He returns to Scotland, an old man whose view of the world, shaped by his life's experience impresses the visiting Monsignor who has spent the night reading his journals.

He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is now a young adult leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm ""Angus"" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Catholic Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest.Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, ""the faith left them when the rice gave out."" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same ""rice Christians"" who were supposed to help him.A local man named Joseph (Benson Fong) hears Francis is in town, and offers to help him rebuild the church out of Christian duty and not for money. Francis then receives medical supplies from his childhood friend Dr. Willie Tulloch (Thomas Mitchell), which allows Francis to offer services to the sick. Francis is summoned to the home of local official, Mr. Chia (Leonard Strong), to heal Chia's only son of his infection. Joseph is apprehensive because if Chia's son dies, Francis will be in danger, but Francis goes anyway. He saves the boy, but Chia and his household are ungrateful because Francis' methods and faith were so contrary to the local tradition. A few weeks later, Chia comes to Francis in order to covert to Christianity, but Francis rejects him because he would not be converting for the proper reasons. Instead, Chia thanks Francis by giving the mission many acres of land and all of Chia's workers in order to build a thriving mission.Two years later, the buildings are almost done, but the nuns arrive a day earlier than planned and Francis is disheveled when they show up. Francis' relationship with the Reverend Mother Maria-Veronica (Rose Stradner) is tense, but they put aside personal differences when the town is the scene of a battle between republic and imperial troops. Willie visits from Scotland and is able to create a makeshift hospital, but the church is destroyed in a fire set by imperial troops. Willie is then shot, and eventually dies. The imperial general then gives Francis a choice: either all food and money from the mission are given to the general or the mission and everyone inside of it is destroyed. Joseph and Francis come up with a plan to sabotage the imperial troops, and Francis is forced to leave his impartiality and blows up the imperial troops.Later, Angus arrives -- now a Monsignor -- as he is making a review of world missionary sites. He tells Francis that the Church cannot pay for the rebuilding of the mission, and that Francis has the lowest conversion rates in the world. Angus implores Francis to convert rich Chinese and live in luxury in order to impress the locals, but Francis refuses. Meanwhile, the Reverend Mother apologizes for her ""shameful"" behavior towards Francis and begs for forgiveness, which she receives.Ten years pass, and Francis' mission is flourishing. The church is full of true Christians, and the town is peaceful. The Reverend Mother tells Francis that American Methodists are building a mission inside town, and Francis goes to visit them. Francis becomes friends with the Methodist missionaries, and peace continues. More years pass, and as Francis prepares to depart China, he learns that Angus is now Bishop.The flashback ends, and Monsignor Sleeth admits to Francis that he read the diary. Francis is flattered, and Sleeth tells Francis that he won't tell the Bishop anything is amiss at Francis' parish, leaving Francis be as he spends his remaining time doing what he loves doing: serving a parish.

Haki makes Leyden aware that he is currently investigating the murder of Greek master criminal Dimitrios Makrpouloss, bloated corpse has just washed ashore on a beach in the Bosphorous. Never having seen a murdered body. Leyden accepts Haki's invitation to view it before cremation. Initially repulsed, he becomes fascinated by Haki's tale of Dimitrios sordid career as he rose from petty crime, smuggling and murder to blackmail, espionage, and political assassination. Following Haki's leads, his investigations lead him to such varied cities as Athens, Sofia, Geneva, and Paris, where he interviews Dimitrios' former mistress, who doesn't rise until ten in the evening, and the urbane, aristocratic cat-fancier who hired Dimitrios to steal state secrets. During his travels Leyden becomes friendly with Mr. Peters, an idiosyncratic three hundred pound Englishman, who seems more obsessed with Makropoulos than Leyden. Peters, who was betrayed by Dimitrios years before, is eager to take revenge on his former partner, and he forms a alliance with the writer to track down and blackmail the enigmatic criminal, a very high-risk enterprise.

                    In the inspired Olivier concept, Shakespeare's play begins as a performance in the Globe Theatre, shifting in broad cinematic terms to an epic narrative of Henry V, who had developed from a dissolute youth to a purposeful monarch. Proving his ability as a soldier and skillful leader, he unites the dissident factions in the English army and goes on to crush the French, against enormous odds, at Agincourt. Arranging a treaty with the French court, he woos Princess Katharine to whom he is formally betrothed as part of the peace agreement.

                    In late 1941, with the Nazi invasion of Russia still advancing, the Red Army leaves bands of guerillas behind in the forests. One such band is joined by beautiful ballet dancer Nina; initially inept, a series of bitter lessons gradually make her a seasoned soldier. The group still form human attachments, despite the shadow of grim death that makes their greatest hope one of selling their lives dearly...

                    On their advance on the Russian front, the Nazis stay primarily on the main roads because of the large number of Russian guerrillas staked out in remote areas ready to attack. Vladimir leads one such group of guerrillas, who are based in an underground bunker in the forest, and who as a collective span demographics: young/old, males/females. Their primary goal is to hinder the Nazi advance in any way possible, which includes killing Nazis, and gathering and providing intel to Russian troops. Into their midst comes renowned ballerina Nina, who was on her way to entertain Russian troops, but who got separated from her entourage. Her presence causes some issue among the guerrillas: some of the men, especially young Mitya, are enthralled with her as a woman, but everyone realizes that she has no skills upon which to help them - including not being able to do any of the domestic duties in the bunker - and as such should leave as soon as possible. But as time progresses, Nina herself begins to have strong feelings for what she can accomplish as a guerrilla, especially as she has fallen in love with Vladimir, and he with her. The question becomes whether Vladimir and Nina's relationship compromises the effectiveness of the group, especially in Vladimir's decision making when it involves Nina.

                    London based American nurse, Susan, Lady Ashwood, is at the hospital awaiting the imminent arrival of injured soldiers. She is hoping that her enlisted son, Sir John Ashwood, who resembles his father both in appearance and temperament, is not among those injured. As she waits, she remembers back to WWI when her husband, the previous Sir John Ashwood, was enlisted, and the waiting she endured on any news from and about him while he was away in battle. From a humble background, Sue almost didn't meet Sir John let alone marry him as she and her father, Hiram Dunn, the publisher of a small daily newspaper, were only in London in April 1914 on a two week vacation - her first ever trip - that was not going very well when by happenstance she got invited on her last day in London to the king's ball, where Sir John was awaiting the arrival of another young woman with who he was supposed to keep company for the evening. Despite being mutually attracted to each other, the patriotic Sue didn't know whether she could leave the United States and get accustomed both to John's family's aristocratic manners as well as the English customs in general. She also thinks back to approximately ten years earlier when she was urged by her father to return to the States on the inevitability that the Germans would once again be the aggressors in a war. Through it all, Sue is a proud American despite having lived the better part of her life in England.

While visiting the museum where it goes on display, Holmes shows the curator how easily it could be stolen by simply cutting the electrical wires. During that demonstration, Giles Conover, a well-known thief, snatches the pearl and runs off. He's soon caught but the pearl is nowhere to be found. Soon after, homes are being broken into with the occupants having their backs broken. There also seems to be a large amount of china broken in the process. After several such break-ins, Holmes realizes that several similar pieces of porcelain, all of a bust of Napoleon, are found at each house. Realizing its significance, he sets a trap for the thief.

                    The political career of Woodrow Wilson is chronicled, beginning with his decision to leave his post at Princeton to run for Governor of New Jersey, and his subsequent ascent to the Presidency of the United States. During his terms in office, Wilson must deal with the death of his first wife, the onslaught of German hostilities leading to American involvement in the Great War, and his own country's reticence to join the League of Nations.

                    The life of Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States, is presented from his time as President of Princeton University in 1909 to his final second in the White House on March 4, 1921. Despite having written books on politics, he was surprised to be approached to run for his first political office as Governor of New Jersey, that surprise because he did not see himself as being a politician in the traditional sense of the word. Although party brass would somewhat regret asking him to do so, the political system which was ruled by the boss system, Wilson became a populist politician largely because he stayed true to his own convictions rather than work the political system either for his advantage or for the advantage of his party masters, who thought they could manipulate him because of not being a seasoned politician. Following a rough Democratic Party nomination process, Wilson swept into the White House in the 1912 election, his presidency where he continued staying true to himself and doing what he said he would do, despite those around him often advising him to take more politically expedient paths. Key events which would mark his presidency include how he would deal with the German aggression in Europe and in the North Atlantic, and his push to create what was called the League of Nations following the end of the Great War despite naysayers believing such an organization would dilute American power in the global sense. His time in the White House was also a period that marked the death of his wife, Ellen Wilson, the love of his life, and his subsequent relationship with Edith Bolling Galt, the decision to marry or not which may have affected his popularity as a politician.

                    Princeton University president Woodrow Wilson leaves his post to run for governor of New Jersey, and soon becomes President of the United States. The turmoil of this era, from the death of his first wife, Ellen, and his remarriage to the glamorous Edith Galt, to the buildup to and aftermath of World War I, is faithfully dramatized. Wilson's political opponent Henry Cabot Lodge serves as the film's primary villain.

This year during a thunderstorm, the statue is hit by lightning and the head falls off. The daughter insists that a new statue be erected instead of patching the old one. Mayor Crandall is sent to New York to interview the prospective sculptor, George Corday. While there, she gets involved in a nightclub raid and goes to jail after she is mistaken for the club's stripper. Back at home, she tries to keep the scandal quiet and to forget Corday but he shows up and moves into her garage to work on the statue. Corday playfully uses the scandal to blackmail her into accepting his advances. Ann Crandall's step-daughter and her boyfriend add still more complications to the situation.

                    In this family saga, Mrs. Parkington recounts the story of her life, beginning as a hotel maid in frontier Nevada where she is swept off her feet by mine owner and financier Augustus Parkington. He moves them to New York, tries to remake her into a society woman, and establishes their home among the wealthiest of New York's high society. Family and social life is not always peaceful, however, and she guides us, in flashbacks, through the rises and falls of the Parkington family fortunes.

                    One Christmas, scandal erupts within the Parkington family, the scandal which threatens both the Parkington expansive fortune and public good name. Widowed Susie Parkington, the matriarch of the Parkington family, handles the situation always thinking about what her husband, the rough and tumble and extremely stubborn Major Gus Parkington, would have done. Susie reminisces about her life with the Major which includes: their meeting when she was living with her family in their boarding house in Leaping Frog, Nevada, where the Major owned the town's mine; her quick need to adjust to high society life in New York as Mrs. Parkington while the Major adjusted to loving a woman for the first time that he didn't want to hurt or abuse; their private battle during a public humiliation; and their estrangement following the death of their son. With thoughts of the Major deep in her mind, Susie makes a unilateral decision, one contrary to the wishes of most of the family, but one that will restore her own sense of what is means to be a Parkington in the truest sense of the Major.

Hank is a proud man who does his job admirably and has the respect of his peers working aboard ship. His pride is damaged to the point that he stalks the woman once they dock with the intention of getting revenge. At the same time, one of the ship's officers is smitten by the comely Mildred but she rebukes him. Hank is taken to jail by police after attempting to force his way into Mildred's fancy apartment building. He behaves like a wild man until cops hose him down. His ship's buddies arrange to get him released and he immediately finds Mildred in her unlocked apartment. He takes in the lush surroundings of ""privilege"" and intends to choke the woman but she faints and he simply carries her to a couch. As she awakens, she tries to use her charms to get away from him and he finally realizes she isn't worth the trouble of getting even. He considers the source of the slur made aboard ship and decides he is too happy in his own skin to seek revenge on someone as boorish as Mildred. He leaves her presence with a new sense of worth, stops by a bar and discovers the drunken ship's officer passed out after yet another rebuke from Mildred. He carries the officer back to the ship and resumes his work stoking coal with his buddies, smiling with his new self-confidence and satisfaction.

Reminding his boss that he is off the next two weeks for his marriage and honeymoon, Ralph asks if he can tackle it when he gets back. S.K. tells him someone else will do it, but to think about it. He stops at the door and remarks how he doesnt want to think about a horror story on his honeymoon.Stopping at the same gas station, Ralph asks for six gallons of gas. Sam begins cleaning his windshield and doesnt notice Ralph exiting the car. When he asks to check under the hood, Sam notices the driver is missing and goes to check anyway. Ralph returns to the car and asks what he owes. He pays the man and leaves without any gas having been put in. A few miles down the road, Ralph runs out of gas.Stella (Louise Curry) stops at the gas station for directions and is told the same thing by Nicholas. He tells Sam to check the meters while he calls the house. Meanwhile Ralph flags down the car driven by Stella, who agrees to take him to the next gas station.

Toby returns with four girls who have been held in separate compartments under the house. Marlowe brings in Stella, keeping his gaze fixed on her. Evelyn is brought in and seated across from Stella. Marlowe, having placed his hands on their hands, commands  proceed. As Toby bangs on the drum, Nicholas begins voodoo incantations with a piece of rope stretched out between two skulls. Marlowe, gazing at each woman, begins intoning:  mind to mind, soul from body to body, emotion to emotion, life to death.  The rope is seen tying itself into a knot, which is finally cut by a saber wielded by Nicholas. Stella is seen weakening and slouching back in her chair.

He is comforted by Nicholas, who tells him that they have the wrong person.Ralph tells the sheriff (Henry Hall) about the strange disappearance of Stella. The sheriff remains unconvinced of Ralphs story but remarks that it is similar to the four other missing girls. He complains that his job is hard because of this. He begins to write down about the disappearance and asks where it took place. Ralph tells him the location, saying that it was after the detour sign. The sheriff insists there is no detour sign because no one is working on the road. Ralph remembers that when he drove back that way the sign was gone. The sheriff tells them to go home and that he and Deputy Elmer (Dan White) will go out to the house to investigate. Driving along the way, Elmer and the sheriff discuss what they might find at the doctors house.Marlowe adjusts a device projecting rays on his wife when the doorbell rings. The sheriff tells Elmer to search the grounds for the girl and the car. Marlowe answers the door and invites the sheriff inside. Telling the sheriff he uses very little light in the house because of his eyes, Marlowe offers a drink of sherry to him. Marie listens at the door. The sheriff begins looking around the room. Marlowe comes out into the hall and signals for Marie to come. He tells her to take Evelyn down to the cellar because the sheriff may want to search the house. Returning with the sherry, they drink a toast. Marlowe asks what the sheriff wants and is asked if there was a detour sign in the area. Marlowe asks if the road is being repaired and is told no. He says he is confused to which the sheriff agrees. Marie and Toby take Mrs. Marlowe downstairs. As Marlowe and the sheriff talk more about the detour, the phone rings and Marlowe goes to answer it. It is Nicholas calling from the station to report another girl. Marlowe tells him that he is busy talking with the sheriff and hangs up.After the sheriff leaves we see Toby checking on the girls. He opens the door of Stella and she comes out. He tells her the master would beat him if he knew she was out of her cage. He leaves but forgets to secure the door. Meanwhile Marlowe tells the others the sheriff asked about the girls but suspects nothing. Stella goes through the underground tunnel and out through the trap door. Marlowe calls for the last subject to be brought in again. Returning for Stella, Toby finds her gone and begs Grego not to tell Marlowe. They run into the room and Toby confesses the girl is gone. He is told to find her on threat of death.Elmer and the sheriff see Stella walking in the road and the sheriff exclaims  gosh all fishhooks.  They stop and put Stella in the car, heading for the Benton house.When Stella is brought to the Bentons she is identified as the missing girl. The sheriff says she was either sleepwalking or hypnotized. Ralph says to call a doctor. They are unable to arouse her from her trance state. Marlowe is told by Toby he knows where the girl is.

He is introduced to Mrs. Benton by the sheriff, who suggests the doctor might be able to help Stella. Marlowe is shown in to see Stella, who becomes somewhat excited in her breathing as she sees him.

Nicholas (George Zucco) comes out and tells her to drive four miles and turn right at the fork in the road. He informs her that she may encounter a detour sign since there has been road work being done. She drives on. He tells the attendant Sam (Ralph Littlefield) to close up. Then he calls on a phone set up inside a wall box to the nearby house, telling them a young girl is on the way. He leaves to go to the house.At the roadblock a false set of bushes is removed by Toby (John Carradine) and Grego (Pat McKee), who place a detour sign in the road. The car approaches and takes the detour onto the dirt road. At this point a switch is thrown at the house which disables the car engine. Coming out from the underbrush, Toby and Grego kidnap the girl and take her to the house. Newspaper headlines show another missing girl.Ralph Dawson (Tod Andrews as Michael Ames) is summoned into the office of Banner Motion Picture Company by S.K.-the Producer (John Ince) who puts him onto the missing girl story seen in the papers. Reminding his boss that he is off the next two weeks for his marriage and honeymoon, Ralph asks if he can tackle it when he gets back. S.K. tells him someone else will do it, but to think about it. He stops at the door and remarks how he doesnt want to think about a horror story on his honeymoon.Stopping at the same gas station, Ralph asks for six gallons of gas. Sam begins cleaning his windshield and doesnt notice Ralph exiting the car. When he asks to check under the hood, Sam notices the driver is missing and goes to check anyway.

A few miles down the road, Ralph runs out of gas.Stella (Louise Curry) stops at the gas station for directions and is told the same thing by Nicholas.
