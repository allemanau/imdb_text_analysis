                    The sufferings of a martyr, Jeanne D'Arc (1412-1431). Jeanne appears in court where Cauchon questions her and d'Estivet spits on her. She predicts her rescue, is taken to her cell, and judges forge evidence against her. In her cell, priests interrogate her and judges deny her the Mass. Threatened first in a torture chamber and then offered communion if she will recant, she refuses. At a cemetery, in front of a crowd, a priest and supporters urge her to recant; she does, and Cauchon announces her sentence. In her cell, she explains her change of mind and receives communion. In the courtyard at Rouen castle, she burns at the stake; the soldiers turn on the protesting crowd.

                    The Tramp finds himself at a circus where he is promptly chased around by the police who think he is a pickpocket. Running into the Bigtop, he is an accidental sensation with his hilarious efforts to elude the police. The circus owner immediately hires him, but discovers that the Tramp cannot be funny on purpose, so he takes advantage of the situation by making the Tramp a janitor who just happens to always be in the Bigtop at showtime. Unaware of this exploitation, the Tramp falls for the owner's lovely acrobatic stepdaughter, who is abused by her father. His chances seem good, until a dashing rival comes in and Charlie feels he has to compete with him.

                    The owner and ringmaster of a traveling circus blames everyone but himself for the circus' troubles. He is especially hard on his stepdaughter Merna, one of the circus riders. A poor and starving Tramp comes into the realm of the circus solely as means to get away from the police as he is mistaken for a pickpocket working the carnival midway, the Tramp who unwittingly has on his possession one of the stolen wallets. As the Tramp and his pursuers enter into the circus ring during the middle of a performance, the audience mistakenly believes he is one of the circus clowns. As such, he becomes the biggest hit of the show. Believing the Tramp the panacea for the circus' financial problems, the ringmaster wants to hire him as a clown without really telling him how valuable an asset he would be to the show to get his employ for as cheaply as possible. Another problem may be the Tramp trying to figure out in a scripted act what made his impromptu first appearance so funny. Through his stay with the circus, he and Merna becomes friends, he wanting to be her protector from her stepfather. As he starts to fall for her, she starts to fall for Rex, the circus' new tightrope walker. The Tramp starts to fight for Merna's affections in the only way he knows how - by becoming a tightrope walker himself.

He tries to maintain a very delicate balance between his loyalty to his ruler and his patriotism and humanist feeling for his men. His intelligence officers capture two dedicated revolutionaries, Lev Andreyev and the beautiful Natalie Dabrova. Although he imprisons Andreyev, he becomes infatuated with the beautiful Natalie and quickly installs her as his mistress even though he knows fully well her Bolshevik leanings. She initially agrees in order to use her position to gather information but soon finds herself drawn to Sergius Alexander's humanity. After the inevitable happens and the White Army is defeated, the Duke, broken in body and spirit, finds himself in 1928 Hollywood as an obscure extra. When he is recognized by Andreyev, now a successful Hollywood director, the former revolutionary is struck by the irony of hiring his old nemesis for a war film and casting him as a general.

Among the passengers is Sadie Thompson, for who Pago Pago is only a transit stop in that she is on her way to Apia on the nearby island of Upolu, where she is to start work for the steamship company itself. Due to circumstances, she is forced to stay in Pago Pago additional days, which places her in a difficult situation as she slowly starts to run out of money. Sadie is either fun loving or a harlot depending on one's perspective, the latter perspective that of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Davidson, fellow passengers on that steamship. Davidson, a self-professed deacon, is a reformer who has the ear of all the governors representing the South Pacific islands. His self-righteous and sanctimonious beliefs and attitudes include sinners needing to show true penance to achieve ultimate salvation. He believes that Sadie is a prostitute who is going to continue to ply her trade in Apia. He is only half right as she was a prostitute in San Francisco, where she left to start life anew. Davidson confronts her with his beliefs about her, he threatening to get the governor to deport her back to San Francisco, which would be her worst nightmare as she is also escaping other things in San Francisco. By this time, Sadie and US Marine Sergeant Tim O'Hara have fallen in love with each other, Tim who knows her past but still wants to marry her to live a new life together in Sydney. As such, Tim does whatever he can to stop the powerful Davidson, who is not as righteous as he would like the world to believe.

                    General Marmaduke Oldfish Pepper drives his daughter Peggy Pepper from their Georgia home to Hollywood so that they can prove to the Hollywood filmmaking community and thus the world that she is a great and serious dramatic actress. Unlike the royal reception and easy ride they were expecting, Peggy is treated like the plethora of other Hollywood hopefuls, that is until they meet bit player Billy Boone at a studio commissary, he who believes she would be perfect for the movie which he is currently filming. It isn't until after filming her first scene that she realizes that Billy is part of a comedy troupe, the movie is a slapstick comedy, and the Georgia ""hokum"" (as it is described by the director) that is Peggy's acting is perfect for broad farce, and is not the great serious art that Peggy had mistakenly believed. Billy, who is falling for Peggy, did not mean to denigrate her, but wants her to embrace her natural comedy. After Peggy does, she becomes an overnight success as a comedic movie actress. Peggy does come to the attention of ""serious"" Hollywood, who try to capitalize on that success. She is convinced by one of her serious movie leading men, Andre Telfair, who is really French Count Andre d'Bergerac, that her private life has to match that serious screen image for her to become a complete success in Hollywood. Thus, transforming herself from Peggy Pepper, down home Georgia waif, to ""Patricia Pepoire"", serious French aristocratic actress may be her biggest acting challenge to date. She will eventually have to come to a decision if losing her identity is worth what was her original goal, that being a serious dramatic actress.

                    Angela and Gino are a young couple living in Naples. They met when Gino, a struggling artist, was trying to sell his paintings on the streets and Angela was a performer in traveling street carnival. One of his first declarations of love to her was a portrait he painted of her in an angelic pose. To make ends meet, they ultimately have to sell that painting. Just after their engagement and just after he receives an important commission which would make their lives more comfortable, Angela's past catches up with them. It is a past that includes criminal behavior - albeit done out of love and a need for survival - and one of which Gino knows nothing. It threatens their life, not only in not being able to be together but the also in the love they have for each other. The angelic painting may prove to be their ultimate salvation.

But equally inhospitable are the unrefined way the people in Sweet Water live to which she is unaccustomed, and Cora, who believes Letty has come to steal Beverly away from her. As such, Cora orders Letty out of her and Bev's house. With no money, Letty is forced to accept one of the marriage proposal she receives, the lesser evil being that from Bev and Cora's ranching neighbor, Lige Hightower, a man who she does not love. Despite a less than harmonious start, Letty, in part due to her isolation as she is more often than not forced to stay inside due to the wind, begins to have affection for Lige, who wants to do right by her, and who promises to send her back to Virginia when he is financial able. But a visitor who takes refuge in their house away from the wind may threaten Letty's ultimate happiness.

                    Even when Diana, Neville and David played together as children, Diana knew that she loved Nevs. But Morton, Nevs' father, did not like any Merrick. Since Nevs did not have any money, Morton sent him off to Egypt to work and also talked him out of marrying Diana before he left. Diana waited two years and then married David, who Jeffry thought was the greatest thing since sliced bread. While in Paris, David jumps to his death when the cops come after him and Diana lies about the reason for the sake of Jeffry. Of course Jeffry, who has been a drunk all his life, cuts all ties with Diana. While Nevs still loves Diana, she does not return to England for seven years - just 3 days before Nevs' wedding to Constance.

In 1920 he helps the partisans fight for the Soviets against the occupying army. However he is captured when the army tries to requisition cattle from the herdsmen at the same time as the commandant meets with the reincarnated Grand Lama.

His preoccupation with baseball and the Yankees has prevented him from being able to focus on and thus keep the various jobs that he's had, such as as a soda jerk and cab driver. The one other thing he may love just as much is his girlfriend, Jane Dillon. After an adventurous trip to Coney Island together, Speedy realizes that he wants to marry Jane, which means needing to get and keep a job. But before she can get married, she wants to ensure that the affairs of her grandfather, Pop Dillon, are finalized. He owns and operates the last horse drawn streetcar in New York City, in what is perhaps the most idyllic section of town. Most of the big streetcar companies want to buy Pop out for a song, but when Speedy learns that there is a planned merger of all streetcar services in New York City which cannot go ahead until all the smaller franchisees, such as Pop, are bought out, Speedy encourages Pop to hold out for a lucrative deal. As such, the large streetcar owners work nefariously behind the scenes to ruin Pop's business. Speedy, with the help of Pop's equally aged friends and a stray dog that followed Speedy home from Coney Island, do whatever they can to make sure Pop has what is truly coming to him, which may not happen if they can't stop the wrong-doings of those big streetcar companies.

Joe and Jim, brothers from South Carolina; Lars, escaping a shrewish wife in Michigan; a poor farmer from Kansas; weathered prospectors from Nevada; and countless others leave San Francisco by ship. The Bulkys head north to open a restaurant, bringing a poor relative, Berna, along to help. On board Berna meets Larry and falls in love. The overland route to Dawson City is hazardous and arduous. Each person must carry their own food, a ton of it. That means traveling 80 miles back and forth to advance one mile, carrying 50 pounds a trip. The Chilkoot Pass is one of the worst sections of the trail. In the spring the trekkers take to the rivers, swollen by melting ice. Whitehorse Rapids proves the last and biggest obstacle to reaching the gold fields. But that's not the end of the hardships. Claim jumping, blizzards, fires, and Berna's honor at stake are to be faced before striking it rich.

                    It's the mid-nineteenth century. The neighboring Shore and Crowninshield families of the American east coast have a long tradition of seafaring. Of Jeremiah Shore's four sons, the only one not at sea is the youngest, Joel Shore, solely because of his age. Joel has had a long friendship with the Crowninshield's daughter, Priscilla Crowninshield, that friendship which is now on the brink of romantic love as they become of age, although this new-found love is unspoken on both sides. Joel hopes that when his eldest brother, Mark Shore, captain of the Nathan Ross, returns home from his latest voyage, he will allow Joel to sail with him. Although Mark still sees Joel as the ""youngin'"" of the family, Joel, through slightly underhanded means, is able to convince Mark that he is man enough to become a sailor. Also on this layover at home, Mark notices that Priscilla has become a beautiful young woman, who he now wants to marry. Mark arranges the engagement with his father and Priscilla's father without Priscilla's knowledge. The public announcement of the engagement shocks both Joel and Priscilla, the latter who has no romantic interest in Mark. On the Nathan Ross' first sailing following the engagement, that sailing to Singapore, Captain Mark makes a decision that unwittingly sets off a series of events that jeopardize both his and Joel's lives, but also tests whether in this situation family and brotherly loyalty or being with the woman you love is more important.
