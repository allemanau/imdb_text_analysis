However, before the exchange can take place, Ugarte is arrested by the police under the command of Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). A corrupt Vichy official, Renault accommodates the Nazis.

They must have the letters to escape to America to continue his work. At the time Ilsa first met and fell in love with Rick in Paris, she believed her husband had been killed. When she discovered that he was still alive, she left Rick abruptly without explanation and returned to Laszlo, leaving Rick feeling betrayed. After the club closes, Ilsa returns to try to explain, but Rick is drunk and bitterly refuses to listen.At different times Rick and Ilsa torment themselves by asking the club's piano player, Sam (Arthur ""Dooley"" Wilson), to play As Time Goes By, a song they loved when they were together in Paris. The famous line ""Play it again, Sam,"" which refers to this song, doesn't actually appear in the movie -- Ilsa says ""Play it, Sam,"" and later, Rick orders ""Play it!"" While Sam plays the song, Rick reminisces about his affair with Ilsa in Paris. Though she seems happy to be with Rick, her mood near the end of their time together is cautious because she has learned her husband may not be dead. When the Nazis begin to close in on Paris, she receives word that Victor is indeed alive in another part of Europe. She and Rick had been planning to take a train to Southern France to escape the German Army's assault; however, on the platform Rick receives a handwritten letter from her. She writes that she can't explain why she's leaving him but she loves him. Rick and Sam leave without her.The next night, Laszlo, suspecting that Rick has the letters, speaks with him privately about obtaining them. They're interrupted when a group of Nazi officers, led by Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), commandeer Sam's piano and begin to sing Die Wacht am Rhein (The Watch on the Rhine), a German patriotic song. Infuriated, Laszlo orders the house band to play La Marseillaise in honor of Occupied France. The band leader looks to Rick for guidance; he nods.

                    The story of Rick Blaine, a cynical world-weary ex-patriate who runs a nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco during the early stages of WWII. Despite the pressure he constantly receives from the local authorities, Rick's cafe has become a kind of haven for refugees seeking to obtain illicit letters that will help them escape to America. But when Ilsa, a former lover of Rick's, and her husband, show up to his cafe one day, Rick faces a tough challenge which will bring up unforeseen complications, heartbreak and ultimately an excruciating decision to make.

The cynical lone wolf Blaine comes into the possession of two valuable letters of transit. When Nazi Major Strasser arrives in Casablanca, the sycophantic police Captain Renault does what he can to please him, including detaining a Czechoslovak underground leader Victor Laszlo. Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with Ilsa, Rick's one time love. Rick is very bitter towards Ilsa, who ran out on him in Paris, but when he learns she had good reason to, they plan to run off together again using the letters of transit. Well, that was their original plan....

                    During World War II, Europeans who were fleeing from the Germans, sought refuge in America. But to get there they would first have to go Casablanca and once they get there, they have to obtain exit visas which are not very easy to come by. Now the hottest spot in all of Casablanca is Rick's Cafe which is operated by Rick Blaine, an American expatriate, who for some reason can't return there, and he is also extremely cynical. Now it seems that two German couriers were killed and the documents they were carrying were taken. Now one of Rick's regulars, Ugarte entrusts to him some letters of transit, which he intends to sell but before he does he is arrested for killing the couriers. Captain Renault, the Chief of Police, who is neutral in his political views, informs Rick that Victor Laszlo, a resistance leader from Czechoslovakia, is in Casablanca and will do anything to get an exit visa but Renault has been ""told"" by Major Strasser of the Gestapo, to keep Laszlo in Casablanca. Laszlo goes to Rick's to meet Ugarte, because he was the one Ugarte was going to sell the letters to. But since Ugarte was arrested he has to find another way. Accompanying him is Ilsa Lund, who knew Rick when he was in Paris, and when they meet some of Rick's old wounds reopen. It is obvious that Rick's stone heart was because of her leaving him. And when they learn that Rick has the letters, he refuses to give them to him, because ""he doesn't stick his neck out for anyone"".

When Oliver brings her a Siamese kitten as a gift, for example, the cat hisses at Irena, so they return to the pet store and exchange it for a bird. While in the pet store, Irena's presence sets all the animals to caterwauling. Several weeks later, the bird dies in fear when Irena reaches for it in its cage.Irena is haunted by a tale from her country that tells how the people of her village were witches, devil worshippers, and, under strong emotions like jealousy or anger, could change into panthers. She refers to them as the 'cat people.' Oliver takes it as a folktale, but Irena takes it for real, so real that she refuses to sleep with her husband because she believes that she might kill him.Oliver suggests that Irena see a psychiatrist, so she goes to see Dr Louis Judd [Tom Conway], who was recommended to Oliver by his co-worker, Alice Moore [Jane Randolph]. When Irena returns home after the first session, she finds Oliver and Alice seated on the couch, talking about her.

They plan to meet in about an hour, but Irena does not show. After leaving the museum, Alice goes to the gymnasium for a late swim. Irena follows her. The place is empty, save for the desk clerk and cleaning lady. As Alice gets into her swimsuit, she hears what sounds like a growl. Scared, Alice dives into the deep end of the pool and treads water in place. The growling gets louder. It's in the pool room with her. Alice starts to scream. Suddenly the light goes on, revealing Irena standing there. Irena asks if Alice knows where Oliver is, and then leaves. When Alice gets out of the water, she finds that her robe has been torn to ribbons.Alice goes to see Dr Judd. She tells him about being followed twice by something inhuman, which she believes may be Irena's cat form. Judd thinks it's all in her imagination. Irena consults Dr Judd, too. She tells him about the incidents with Alice, but he tells her that she is on the border of insanity and he could have her put away. He advises her to forget all this cat people stuff and lead a normal life. When Oliver comes home that evening, Irena is setting the table for a romantic dinner. She tells him that she's no longer afraid, but Oliver says that it's too late. 'I love Alice,' he admits. Irena tells him to leave.

                    Serbian national Irena Dubrovna, a fashion sketch artist, has recently arrived in New York for work. The first person who she makes a personal connection with there is marine engineer Oliver Reed. The two fall in love and get married despite Irena's reservations, not about Oliver but about herself. She has always felt different than other people, but has never been sure why. She lives close to the zoo, and unlike many of her neighbors is comforted by the sounds of the big cats emanating from the zoo. And although many see it purely as an old wives' tale, she believes the story from her village of ancient residents being driven into witchcraft and evil doing, those who managed to survive by escaping into the mountains. After seeing her emotional pain, Oliver arranges for her to see a psychiatrist to understand why she believes what she does. In therapy, Dr. Judd, the psychiatrist, learns that she also believes, out of that villagers' tale, that she has descended from this evil - women who change into great cats like panthers in passion, anger or jealousy - and that she will turn into a such a dangerous big cat upon being kissed in turn killing her lover and others who have betrayed her. This belief is why she has resisted falling in love before she met Oliver. Learning this information from Irena, Oliver wants to do whatever needed to help her as does Dr. Judd. But Irena's beliefs may be tested when Oliver's friendship with a co-worker named Alice Moore may become more than just friends...

Trees grew so thickly here, that the morning first rays of sunlight could hardly break trough. The air was still and blue with mist. The faint, silvery sound of a distant waterfall was the only noise to be heard.A few drowsy birds were just beginning to greet the new day as a huge old owl swooped silently towards the hollow tree where he made his home. The world was waking up all around him. A little wood-mouse slipped out of her nest to wash her face in a dewdrop. Three baby sparrows cheeped shrilly as their mother brought them their first meal of the day: A cluster of berries. And with every second, the pale sunbeams grew brighter.The young rabbit Thumper, who was always the first of his family to arise, was waking up slowly, yawning and scratching as he did every morning.But the owl was ready for bed. With a sigh he alighted on a branch, waddled into his hole, and fluffed up his feathers. His drowsy eyes dipped shut, and he fall asleep.He didn't get to stay asleep very long.A bluebird darted trough the air to perch on the tree next to the owl's. He twittered, and flew off.From every corner, animals popped out of their hiding places and raced after her. Mrs. Quail moved swiftly along the forest floor, her babies trailing after her as if they were on a string.Thumper's sisters burst out of their house, tumbling over each other and their brother in their anxiety to get to the thicket first. Thumper dashed to the foot of the owl's tree and began drumming frantically on the ground with his right foot. ""Wake up! Wake up!"" he hollered at the top of his lungs.The owl shook himself irritably and squinted down at Thumper. ""Oh, what now?"" he groaned.""Wake up, Friend Owl!"" the little rabbit persisted.""Why? What's going on around here, anyway?""""It's happened! The new prince is born!"" shouted Thumper. ""We're going to see him! Come on, you'd better hurry up!"" And he dashed into the underbrush after his sisters. ""The new prince!"" The owl gave his feathers a hasty preening and soared into the air.The prince was a tiny fawn, only two hours old. When the animals reached the thicket where he had been born, he was curled up, sound asleep, next to his mother's warm side.He didn't even stir as the creatures of the forest gathered into a circle around him.""Oh, my!"" said Mrs. Raccoon with a wistful sigh. ""Isn't he just the most-""""Oh, my! Beautiful!"" echoed hushed maternal voices from all around the circle.""Yes, indeed,"" said the owl from a bough overhead. ""This is, em, quite an occasion. Yes, sir. It isn't every day a prince is born.""He bent low in a courtly bow to the fawn's mother. ""You are to be congratulated.""""Thank you,"" said the prince's mother quietly. She leaned over and gave her baby a loving nudge. ""Wake up,"" she whispered. ""Come on, dear. We have company.""Slowly, slowly the tiny fawn's head lifted. He stared wonderingly at the creatures standing in front of him.""Hello, Prince!"" squeaked a mouse timidly. At once a chorus of greetings sprang up, and the owl let out a loud ""hoo-hoo"" so loud that the fawn turned away and burrowed his face into his mother's side. Then he gathered up his courage and peeked out again. And this time he managed a shy smile.""Look!"" called Thumper excitedly. ""He's trying to get up!""He was, but it wasn't working very well.Try as he might, the fawn couldn't get his slender legs to work together.""He's kinda wobbly, isn't he?"" noted Thumper.""Thumper!"" gasped Mrs. Rabbit. She gave a flustered smile at the fawn's mother.Thumper scowled. ""But he is,"" he muttered, kicking at the ground in embarrassment. ""Aren't you?"" he asked the fawn.The fawn nodded eagerly. He hadn't understood a word.The owl chuckled. ""Looks to me like he's getting kind of sleepy,"" he said. ""I think it's time we all left.""There was a murmur of protest from the younger animals. But the owl leaned over and fixed such a schoolmasterish glare on the crowd that they began to melt into the woods without another word.Only Thumper still lingered in the thicket.""Whatcha gonna call him?"" he asked the fawn's mother when everyone else had left.She smiled at him. ""Well, I think I'll call him Bambi,"" she answered.Thumper frowned thoughtfully, as if the choice were up to him. ""Bambi,"" he repeated, trying it out.""Bambi. Yup, I guess that'll do all right."" And he hopped off to find his family.Bambi's mother glanced down at her baby, who was sound asleep again.""Bambi,"" she murmured tenderly. ""My little Bambi.""As the mother and child settled down together, high on the hill above the thicket the Great Prince of the Forest kept watch.2. Exploring the forest""Walking already, well, what do you know?"" commented the gray squirrel as Bambi and his mother strolled through the forest. Bambi was three days old now. As far as he was concerned, he was the best walker the forest had ever seen, though sometimes his legs did get tangled. And he was proud that so many of the forest creatures had gotten the chance to see him.He had met Mrs. Quail and her babies scurrying through the underbrush as though they were late for an appointment. He had met Mrs. Possum and her babies, all hanging jauntily upside down from a tree branch. He had met Mr. Mole, who had popped up right under Bambi's nose. ""Good mornin',"" Mr. Mole had said politely. ""Nice, sunny day."" He had squinted up at the bright sky, winced a little, and returned with relief to his tunneling. The curious little fawn tried to follow the mole's path, but wound up tumbling over some reeds as his mother and the rabbit family looked on.""He doesn't walk very well, does he?"" asked Thumper with interest.""Thumper!"" scolded his mother. ""What did your father tell you this morning?""Thumper sighed. ""If you can't say somethin' nice... Don't say nothin' at all,'"" he muttered, frowning down at the ground.Bambi's mother leaned over and nuzzled Bambi's shoulder a little. ""Come on, Bambi,"" she urged gently. ""Get up. Try again.""""Come on! Come on!"" squealed Thumper and his sisters excitedly. ""Get up! Get up! You can do it!""And after he'd managed to sort his legs out, Bambi pranced happily off after his new friends.But, trying to follow the little rabbits, the young deer had difficulties with a large log lying across the path.""C'mon, you can do it,"" encouraged Thumper.""Hop over it. Like this."" All the bunnies chimed in as they leapt back and forth over the log, ""Hop over it! Hop over it!""Bambi stepped back to gather momentum, but his hop landed him smack-dab on top of the log.""You didn't hop far enough,"" said Thumper wisely.Bambi finally got all of himself over the log, but in the process his legs became tangled once more, causing the bunnies all to scatter just in case he might fall on them.3. Learning to speakAlong the path, Bambi and his companions came upon a flock of delighted finches who had discovered a bush full of delicious wild berries.Bambi looked inquiringly at Thumper.""Those are birds,"" Thumper told him.""B-burr?"" Bambi repeated.He hadn't had the faintest idea that the word was going to pop out of him, and neither had the rabbits. ""Hey! He talked!"" yelled Thumper. ""He's trying to say 'bird'!""""Burr!"" Bambi said again.""Huh-uh."" Thumper never missed the chance to be instructive. He clambered up onto a rock and looked Bambi in the eye. ""Say Bir-d;"" he ordered.""Burr,"" Bambi said.""'Bir-duh!"" insisted Thumper.This conversation had taken the finches' attention off the berries. Now they got into the act, too. ""Say bird!"" they peeped excitedly, darting around and around Bambi's head. ""Say bird! Saybirdsaybirdsaybirdsaybird!""""BIRD!""shouted Bambi-so loudly that the little rabbits and finches were scattered helter-skelter. ""Bird!"" he repeated in delight.Thumper's sisters ran back to tell their mother the news. ""He talked! He talked, Mama; the young prince said 'bird.'""Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird,"" sang Bambi happily.Just then another flying creature fluttered slowly toward Bambi and perched on the fawn's tail.Bambi twisted around to stare at it. ""Bird!"" he exclaimed happily. ""It's not a bird,"" Thumper corrected him. ""It's a butterfly.""""B-butterfly?"" Bambi turned around to see the butterfly again. Now it, too, was gone.But over by the rocks the ground seemed to be covered with butterflies!He raced over to them. ""Butterfly! Butterfly!"" he caroled joyfully.""No, they're flowers! Pretty flowers! See?"" Thumper buried his nose in a bunch of yellow petals and sniffed appreciatively. ""Pretty fl . . ."" Bambi's voice trailed off as he, too, began to sniff the flowers. When he raised his head, he was nose-to-nose with a baby skunk.""Flower!"" said Bambi proudly.""M-me?"" The skunk's eyes widened.He was interrupted by peals of laughter.""No, no, no, no, no!"" gurgled Thumper, rolling around and pounding the ground deliriously. ""That's not a flower! He's just a little...""""Oh, that's all right!"" the baby skunk interrupted hastily. He beamed shyly up at Bambi.""He can call me a flower if he wants to. I don't mind.""""Pretty!"" Bambi piped again. ""Pretty flower!""From the look of pure, grateful devotion the baby skunk gave him, it was clear that Bambi had made a friend for life.4. The thunderstormBambi and Thumper were making their way back to their mothers when a huge crack of thunder sounded directly overhead. Startled, Bambi turned to Thumper. Was this some kind of new game, too? But for once Thumper was looking a little uncertain. ""I... I think I'd better go home now,"" he said uneasily, and vanished into the underbrush.CRACK! came the thunder again, and a bolt of lightning sizzled in the sky. Bambi dashed, terrified, after his mother as the first raindrops began to fall.Back at the thicket, Bambi and his mother lay down, listening to the sound of the rain. Bambi yawned, ready for sleep, but just couldn't take his eyes off the falling raindrops.The wood mouse scurried along toward her home, stopping under toadstools whenever she could. A mother robin landed on her nest and quickly covered her three drenched fledglings with her wings.It was dark now, but flashes of lightning kept illuminating the forest with eerie clarity.Thumper and the other rabbits huddled together under the roots of a tree and stared out fearfully at the storm. High up in his hollow tree, the owl grumbled a little and turned his back on the weather.And as the storm passed, Bambi fell asleep beside his mother.5. On the meadowMother, what are we going to do today?"" asked Bambi as he followed her through the forest. It was still so early that he could barely see her through the mist. ""I'm going to take you to the meadow,"" his mother replied.Bambi paused to sniff curiously along the way, then scampered after his mother again. ""Meadow? What's the meadow?"" he asked.""It's a very wonderful place,"" his mother told him.""Then why haven't we been there before?"" asked Bambi.""You weren't big enough,"" his mother replied. They were coming up to a shallow stream now, and she showed him where to cross. The instant they were across, Bambi began chattering away again.""Mother, you know what? Thumper told me we're not the only deer in the forest!""""Well, he's right,"" said his mother. ""There are many deer in the forest besides us.""""Then why don't I ever see them?"" asked the little fawn plaintively.""You will, sometime."" Bambi was excited. ""Today? On the meadow?""""Perhaps,"" his mother told him. ""Hush, now. We're almost there."" And she led him up over a little hill.Bambi had never seen anything like the sight that greeted him on the other side. Stretching out in front of him was what looked like a whole world's worth of long, golden-green grass studded with wildflowers. On one side of the meadow a marshy pond so unlike the rushing streams Bambi knew from the forest was reflecting the peach-colored light in the dawn sky. And the sky! Before this, Bambi had only caught glimpses of the sky through the trees. Out here, why, it's bigger than everything! he marveled. And I never knew the sun was as big as that, or as round!""The meadow!"" he cried exultingly, and raced down the slope toward it.""No, Bambi! Wait!"" In his mother's voice was a note Bambi had never heard before. She streaked ahead of him, wheeled around, and planted herself in his path.""You must never rush out on the meadow,"" she panted. ""There might be danger!"" Then, more gently: ""Out there, we are unprotected. The meadow is wide and open, and there are no trees or bushes to hide us. So we have to be very careful. Wait here.""Chastened, Bambi shrank back into the underbrush.""I'll go out first,"" his mother continued. ""And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.""Only Bambi's frightened brown eyes could be seen as he huddled down in the brush and stared at his mother. Slowly and carefully, she stepped out onto the meadow and gazed across its expanse. Then she looked back at her son. ""Come on, Bambi,"" she called. ""It's all right.""Bambi crept timidly out toward her. His heart was pounding. ""Come on!"" his mother called. He walked hesitantly in her direction, then began to leap more courageously when suddenly she bounded away.Startled, Bambi froze in his tracks, and then he realized that she was playing. He burst into laughter and dashed after her.There was so much room for running on the meadow, and so much to look at! Butterflies brighter than any Bambi had seen in the forest floated leisurely above the flowers. In the sky birds soared and dove for the sheer fun of it, and in the grass Bambi found the rabbits nibbling clover.Bambi took a mouthful but was interrupted by Thumper. ""No, no, not that green stuff. Just eat the blossoms - that's the good stuff."" ""Thumper!!"" his mother called sternly. ""What did your father tell you?""""About what?""""About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens,"" reminded his mother.""Oh, that one."" Thumper cleared his throat. "" 'Eating greens is a special treat... It makes long ears . . . And great big feet.' But it sure is awful stuff to eat!"" he added so just Bambi could hear. ""I made that last part up myself.""Bambi had chased a frog to the pond's edge when he noticed something strange. He had two reflections in the water. Hmmm. Maybe that's just the way things happen on the meadow, he thought as he bent closer to the pond's surface. To his surprise, only one of the reflections moved. The other stayed still, staring mischievously at him.Slowly Bambi lifted his head. There, standing next to him, was another fawn. A long-lashed, delicate-looking fawn who giggled when their eyes met.She giggled again and stepped toward him. Bambi scrambled backwards hastily. Then, as the other fawn took another step in his direction, he turned and dashed back toward the spot where he'd last seen his mother.To his surprise, she was standing next to another doe. ""Bambi, this is your aunt Ena,"" she said as Bambi rushed toward her. ""And that's little Faline.""But Bambi didn't want anything to do with little Faline. Wide-eyed and timid, he drew back behind his mother and peeked out from around one of her legs.For a third time, Faline giggled. ""He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?"" she asked merrily.""Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello,"" her mother replied.""Hello, Bambi,"" Faline said boldly. Bambi retreated even farther behind his mother. ""I said, hello!""""Aren't you going to answer her?"" asked Bambi's mother.Scowling, he shook his head.""You're not afraid, are you?"" asked his mother, and he shook his head again. ""Well, then, go ahead!"" And she pushed him with her nose. ""Go on, say hello,"" she told him firmly, in a motherly, no-nonsense voice. Bambi cleared his throat. He pawed the ground a little. Then he glowered up at Faline.""H'lo,"" he croaked.That was all it took. The silly young Faline giggled and danced around Bambi, who was so shy and confused by her that he fell into a small pond.Faline darted in and out of the pond's cattails, giving Bambi little kisses on his cheeks. Finally, forgetting his shyness, Bambi gave a surprising whoop and charged after her.6. The Great Prince of the ForestBambi and Faline were playing tag when they heard a low, thudding sound. They paused. Could this be another thunderstorm? No. Streaking out of the woods were more deer. Dozens of huge deer, bigger than Bambi could have dreamed. The thudding sound was the noise of their hoofs.Bambi stared at the bucks with awe. They were plunging back and forth across the meadow, leaping fearlessly off the highest boulders and grappling in play-combat. He could hardly believe he would ever grow into something so magnificent. Bambi began to show off with his own imitation of their leaps.Then, as he watched, the bucks grew still. As one, they turned to face the woods. They had all sensed someone coming. It was a mighty stag, far bigger than the rest, with massive antlers fully a yard across.And something about the grave, unhurried way the stag moved toward the meadow told Bambi without any words that he was in the presence of majesty.Slowly, proudly, the stag advanced and walked up to the group of bucks without seeming to notice them. He was about to pass on by when instead he turned his great head and stared down at little Bambi in silence. Bambi stared back, frozen with awe. Then he smiled hesitantly at the huge stag.Not a flicker of expression crossed the stag's face. Only his ears twitched a little, as if he were surprised at Bambi's daring.Bambi's smile faded away, and he felt himself growing shy again without knowing why.The stag continued his slow, stately procession through the meadow and did not look back.Suddenly Bambi became aware that his mother had walked up behind him. ""Mother, he stopped and looked at me,"" he whispered.""Yes, I know.""""Mother, why was everyone still when he came onto the meadow?""""Everyone respects him,"" his mother explained softly. ""For of all the deer in the forest, not one has lived half so long. He's very brave and very wise. That's why he's known as the Great Prince of the Forest.""She turned to watch the stag as he walked away. The old stag looked down on the meadow from a high ledge. He moved deeper into the forest, then halted, sensing something was wrong. Suddenly he turned and raced back through the forest and onto the meadow. Bambi saw the Great Prince charging back toward the other deer as if to warn them. Above him, a flock of crows was screaming crazily in the sky. Before Bambi could ask what was the matter, the other deer were crashing past him, running toward the forest. ""Faline!"" Bambi heard Ena scream, and Faline raced up to her mother's side. The two of them dashed out of sight. A panic-stricken pheasant whirred up into the air directly in front of Bambi. All about him were the thundering of deer hoofs and the screams of terrified birds.The little fawn stood stock-still in the grass watching bewilderedly as the other deer hurtled past him. ""Bambi!"" he heard his mother calling from far away, but so many creatures were blocking his view that he couldn't see her.""Mother!"" he called desperately. ""Mother, where are you?""No answer.""Mother!"" Bambi screamed.Then, without any warning, the great Prince was at his side. Together they raced toward the edge of the forest, where Bambi's mother caught up to them. The three deer dashed to safety just as a shattering explosion rang through the air. Then the only sounds on the meadow were the echo of the shot and the crows' screams...It was sunset before Bambi's mother felt it was safe to come out of hiding. ""Come on out, Bambi,"" she said gently.Bambi didn't budge from his spot deep inside the thicket.""Come on,"" she urged. ""It's safe now. We don't have to hide any longer.""Bambi poked his head out cautiously. When he saw that all was still, he pulled himself out of the thicket little by little and walked, trembling, up to his mother.""What happened, Mother? Why did we all run?"" he asked in a shaky voice.After a long pause she said quietly, ""Man... was in the forest.""Suddenly the air seemed very cold.7. Skating on iceTo Bambi, each golden summer day was like the ones that had come before. Autumn crept in so gradually that year that he hardly noticed the trees changing colors until they began to lose their leaves.First one scarlet maple leaf tore itself loose, then a handful of yellow oak leaves - and then it seemed to Bambi that the whole forest was filled with scraps of color dancing in the wind.Bambi was sure that the last two leaves on the oak tree just outside his thicket meant to stay put forever. Each morning he ran to see whether they were still there, and each morning they were still fluttering bravely on their branch. One day, though, Bambi glanced up to see the smaller of the two leaves shuddering in the breeze. With a sound like a sigh, it broke loose and floated gently to the ground.Only a few seconds later its companion drifted down to lie beside it.The next morning Bambi woke up early, with a sense that something had changed in the night. The air was frosty and cold, and the thicket was filled with a strange bluish-white light. He went to the thicket's opening to explore, and gasped.""Mother, look!"" he cried. ""What's all that white stuff?""His mother lifted her head. ""Why, it's snow!"" she said in surprise.""Snow?"" asked Bambi, staring at the brand new forest.""Yes,"" his mother told him. ""Winter has come.""Bambi took a cautious step into the white drift outside the thicket- ""Look. Footprints!"" he said in delight. Just then, Thumper called from a nearby snow-covered hill.""Hi ya, Bambi! Watch what I can do. Yippee!"" He ran down the hill, leaped out onto the water, which was no longer water but ice, and slid far out on the pond. ""C'mon, it's all right. Look, the water's stiff.""But when Bambi took a mighty leap from the same hill, his ""Yippee"" abruptly ended in an ""Ooof"" and he wound up on his belly. Thumper called out to him, ""Some fun, huh, Bambi?""Bambi responded with a very weak smile. Try as he might, he could not stand on the slippery surface, and his attempts gave Thumper a bad case of the giggles. Through his laughter Thumper managed to say, ""No, no' Ya gotta watch both ends at the same time."" He decided it was time for him to take charge.First Thumper pushed one of Bambi's legs up and then another, then another and another until Bambi stood shakily. But Bambi's legs would not stay put and down he went again. This time his legs got all tied up.""I guess you'd better unwind it,"" Thumper volunteered.Again Thumper got all of Bambi's legs in position, and giving him a good push, together they slid across the ice. For a moment, Thumper's plan seemed to be working, but not for long. Smack! They slid into the biggest snowbank.As Thumper's head popped up out of the snow, he heard a tiny whistling noise coming from a burrow in the side of a hill. Curious, they headed over to see what it was and found Flower, the skunk, lying on his back in a nest of leaves, sound asleep and snoring.""Wake up, wake up!"" said Thumper.Flower opened a drowsy eye. ""Is it spring yet?"" he murmured dreamily.""No!"" said Bambi incredulously. ""Winter's just starting!""""Mmmmm-hmmmmm,"" sighed Flower.""Whatcha doin'?"" asked the curious Thumper. ""Hibernatin?""""Mmmmm-hmmmmm,"" said Flower again.""Whatcha want to do that for?""asked Bambi.Flower chuckled a little- ""All us flowers sleep in the winter,"" he said with a yawn. ""Well, g'night. . .""He pulled his fluffy tail over himself like a quilt, snuggled down into the leaves, and went back to sleep.8. Death on the meadowAs the days grew shorter and the snow grew deeper, winter stopped being fun and became wearisome. Now it seemed to Bambi as though he were always limping along through the snowdrifts, always trying to catch up to the rest of the deer, always fighting the icy wind, always hungry and cold.The deer in the forest had banded together to look for food. For hours every day they struggled through the woods in search of the scraps of bark and twigs that were all the forest offered them now.When Bambi's mother had first torn a piece of bark off a tree and gave it to him, he had been shocked at how dry and tasteless it was. And later even the bark grew scarce. Sometimes the two of them could only find enough for one. When that happened, his mother always went without.Then came the day when they found no bark at all. In every direction, every tree they could see had been stripped higher than Bambi's mother could reach.Back in the thicket, Bambi curled up wearily next to his mother. ""Winter sure is long, isn't it?"" he said with a shiver.""It seems long, but it won't last forever."" His mother comforted him.""I'm awfully hungry, Mother,"" whispered Bambi. His mother kissed him. ""Yes, dear, I know,"" she said patiently.So the weeks passed by, lean and bitter, until one morning Bambi's mother called happily, ""Bambi, come here!"" They had wandered to the meadow that morning, and she was standing near the brook staring down at something in the snow.Bambi scampered over. There in the snow was a patch of green!""New spring grass,"" said his mother.Bambi took an eager mouthful, and then another and another. The grass tasted of spring itself fresh, vibrant, leafy. It was a flavor he had almost forgotten after so many days of hard, dry bark. Bambi ate hungrily.Bambi's mother had barely started to eat when abruptly she stopped and lifted her head to sniff the air. She glanced from side to side as if she were trying to hear something.""Bambi,"" she whispered. But he was so busy eating that he didn't hear her.""Bambi!"" she said in terror.Startled, Bambi looked up at her.""The thicket!"" she cried, and the two of them sprang toward the forest.Bambi had never run so fast. He vaulted over the stream without thinking about it and dashed across the snow. He could hear his mother pounding along just behind him, her breath coming hard. ""Faster!"" she called out. ""Faster, Bambi!"" A shot rang out.Horrified, Bambi glanced back over his shoulder at his mother. ""Keep running! Keep running!"" she cried hoarsely. ""Don't look back!"" Another shot echoed in the air just as he reached the edge of the woods. He leaped forward, darting through the trees, and with a final burst of energy, tore through the underbrush, down the last steps of the old, familiar path, and into the thicket. There he stopped, gasping for breath.""We ... we made it, Mother!"" he panted.""We made it!""There was no answer.""Mother?"" Bambi faltered.Silence.Bambi walked to the entrance of the thicket and peeked out into the woods.There was no sign of his mother. ""Mother!"" Bambi cried again. ""Mother, where are you?"" A light snow was beginning to fait. Trembling, Bambi cautiously left the thicket. His mother was nowhere in sight.Where could she be? He knew she was out there somewhere. Why didn't she answer?""Mother!""The forest had become dark and ominous. The trees seemed bigger and taller and less friendly. The snow was coming down harder now. Bambi tried to retrace his steps, but his tracks were already completely covered. In the muffled silence of the new snow, there was no sound other than his bewildered cries.He called again and again, ""Mother . . . Mother!"" Desperately Bambi searched for her, stumbling through the snowfall that was now so dense he could scarcely see where he was going. His heart was beating so hard that he could not think. He had never known fear like this before, or such loneliness.""Mother,"" he wept, and his head bent low. His last cry froze in his throat and became a startled gasp.A huge, dark shape loomed above him. It was the old stag Bambi had once seen on the meadow. The Great Prince of the Forest. He was staring down at the little fawn, his face hidden in shadow.""Your mother can't be with you anymore,"" he said quietly.Bambi gave one wild, beseeching glance up at the stag. Then, stricken, he bowed his head. A single tear rolled down his cheek and vanished into the snow.""Come... my son,"" said the stag.He turned and walked back into the forest.Bambi looked once -only once- toward the spot where he had last seen his mother.Then, slowly, he began to follow the Great Prince and soon both disappeared in the upcoming blizzard...9. Twitterpated!Winter had come and gone once more and now once again the last patches of snow had melted reluctantly away. The plants in the forest, freed from winter's icy grasp, were springing joyously into life. Sun poured through the new leaves and splashed down onto the wildflowers. The trees were filled with blossoms and birds, the air with fragrance and birdsong. There wasn't a crevice or a cranny in the forest that spring had left untouched.Not that any of this pleased the old owl, who despised spring. He hated all the sunlight and the twittering and the way every tree he tried to take a nap in was filled with lovestruck birds.""Same thing every spring,"" he grumbled.""Tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet! Love's sweet song, huh? Pain in the pinfeathers, I call it... What's that? What's that? Oh, now what's going on?""The sapling he was perched in had suddenly begun to vibrate as though an earthquake were shaking it. It flung the surprised owl right off his perch.He landed with a feather-shaking thump on a branch below. ""Ouch!"" he yelled. ""Stop it! Get out of here! All of you!"" Crossly he peered down at the handsome, broad-shouldered young buck who had been polishing his antlers against the tree trunk. ""And you, too,"" he added, almost falling off his branch again.At the sight of the owl, the young buck broke into a smile. ""Hello, Friend Owl!"" he called gaily. ""Don't you remember me?""""Why. . . why . . . why, it's the young prince'"" gasped the owl, his frown vanishing completely.Bambi nodded.""I see you've traded in your spots for a pair of antlers,"" observed the owl, and Bambi lifted his head proudly. ""Very impressive. You know, just the other day I was wondering what had become of you.""""Hello, Bambi!"" called an eager voice, cutting short the owl's pleasantries. ""I thought that might be you'""It was Thumper! But this Thumper was just as changed as Bambi himself. Gone were the baby roundness of his face and the fluffiness of his little body. He was trim, lean, and sleek now - the perfect specimen of a wild rabbit.As the two friends greeted each other, they heard another voice calling, ""Hi ya, fellas!"" They turned to see Flower waving at them from a patch of daisies. He, too, had grown up, but his smile was as sweet as ever. He was just as bashful as ever, too. When Bambi and Thumper turned toward him, he dropped his head shyly and began sniffing the daisies as though that was what he'd been meaning to do all along.Just then a pair of meadowlarks flew playfully past Flower, zooming around his head almost making him dizzy. The birds chased each other around Bambi's new antlers and played tag over Thumper's head for just a moment before spinning gaily in circles and darting away again.""Well, what's the matter with them?"" Flower asked in amazement. ""Why are they acting that way?""""Don't you know?"" the owl asked them.The three friends shook their heads. ""They're twitterpated!"" the owl explained.""Twitterpated?"" echoed Bambi.""Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the springtime!"" said the owl. Bambi, Thumper, and Flower stared blankly at him, so he explained further.""For example: You're walking along, minding your own business -looking neither to the left nor to the right- when all of a sudden, you run smack into a pretty face. Hoo-hoo!""The owl's voice was dripping with sarcasm.""You begin to get weak in the knees,"" he continued. ""Your head's in a whirl. And before you know it, you're walking on air!""He glowered down at them. ""Knocks you for a loop, it does! And you completely lose your head . . . and it can happen to anybody, so you'd better be careful!""He aimed a cranky wing at Bambi. ""It could happen to you."" He pointed at Thumper. ""To you, too."" He pointed at Flower - and hesitated. ""Yes, it could even happen to you,"" the owl decided after a second. ""So you'd all better watch out!""""Well, it's not going to happen to me,"" said Thumper firmly.""Me neither,"" agreed Bambi.""Me neither!"" said Flower with great force.And with that the three friends marched off into the forest, each of them utterly determined to resist the charms of spring.But, as Flower passed a blossoming bush, he thought he heard it giggle. He hesitated ... he peered into the bush ... he couldn't believe it, but... the bush was blinking back at him. He started to run after Bambi and Thumper, but the bush giggled again.Then a pretty girl skunk came out of the bush and with a whirling dance gave the startled Flower a kiss.Flower was completely twitterpated. He giggled, shrugged his shoulders, and went off happily through the field of daisies with his new girlfriend, Thumper and Bambi were shocked as they watched the two skunk tails disappear together in the distance.In the forest glade ahead, a lovely girl bunny was preening herself. When she saw Thumper approaching . . . well, it was love at first sight- She cleared her throat prettily to get Thumper's attention as he went by.Thumper stopped in midstride and just stared at her with his mouth open.She began humming a song, then fluttered her eyelashes, and said in a sultry, musical voice, ""Hello.""Thumper swallowed hard and said nothing; he was too twitterpated to respond at all.Bambi was appalled at Thumper's behavior and kept walking, leaving him behind under the girl bunny's magic spell. Bambi could hear her singing to Thumper in her soft, seductive voice, ""Lah, lah, lah, lah . . ."" and he could tell that Thumper loved every bit of it.Bambi sighed as he walked slowly toward a stream to take a drink. Bambi bending his head to drink.Suddenly he choked on a mouthful of water. There, in the stream, was another reflection. He lifted his head slowly. Gazing at him with a faint smile on her face was a slender, graceful young doe.""Hello, Bambi,"" she said. ""Don't you remember me?""Bambi only stared at her, open-mouthed.""I am Faline.""Still smiling, Faline advanced across the stream toward him.He took a hasty step backward and tripped over a rock in the stream. Splash! He collapsed in a gawky heap and stared up at Faline. Her smile didn't waver. She looked breathtakingly composed as she continued across the stream toward Bambi.Bambi gathered himself up and clambered backward up the bank of the stream. He might have gotten away, too, if his brand new antlers hadn't become tangled in the branch of an apple tree.Pink petals showered gently down as Bambi shook his head frantically, trying to free himself. But before he'd made any progress, Faline walked up to him, and kissed him on the cheek.Bambi caught his breath. He turned his head toward Faline and stared into her huge, dark eyes.The forest suddenly seemed to Bambi like a cloud-filled sky and he felt as though he could fly, Faline scampered across the stream, paused to look back at Bambi teasingly, then sprang up the bank. Bambi leaped after her, and the two of them bounded off through the forest.10. Fighting bucksSuddenly someone thrust himself between them. It was another buck. Ronno! He was bigger than Bambi and heavier. He scowled fiercely at Bambi and shook his antlers threateningly and began pushing Faline up the path into the forest.""Bambi!"" cried a frightened Faline.Suddenly anger blazed through Bambi and burned his fear completely away. He began to paw the ground with his hoof. Ronno pawed the ground himself and thundered toward Bambi. They grappled antlers for only a second before Ronno flung the younger buck over his shoulder.""Bambi!"" cried Faline in alarm.Bambi hit the ground with a bone-shaking thud. For a minute he lay there motionless, the wind knocked out of him. Then, as Ronno charged toward him again, he staggered to his feet and aimed his antlers at Ronno's chest.Again they grappled and again Ronno threw Bambi into the air.Bambi pulled himself up painfully and stood on his hind legs as Ronno charged. This time the bucks fought with their front hoofs, slashing viciously at each other while a trembling Faline watched. At first she was sure Ronno was going to win the battle. But, little by little, the bigger buck began to tire. He had never before had to fight so long or so hard.He's starting to give up! Bambi exulted as he pushed Ronno backward yet again. They were fighting on the edge of a rain-filled gully now. Bambi gritted his teeth and hurled himself into the air, hitting Ronno with the whole of his weight.Ronno stumbled backward and lost his footing. With a furious shout he tumbled head over heels down the gully and into the water.Ronno shook his head as if to clear it. Then he rose and gave Bambi a bewildered look. He shook his head again and stumbled away through the water.Faline tiptoed up to Bambi's side. She laid her head lovingly on his shoulder. And together they walked through the mists out onto the beauty of the meadow.11. Man returnsOne chilly gray autumn dawn, Bambi woke up with a start. Faline was still sleeping peacefully beside him in the thicket. None of the birds were awake yet, and except for a few falling leaves, the woods seemed still. Yet Bambi was sure there was something wrong. He stood up quietly, so as not to wake Faline, and stepped cautiously out of the thicket.The forest was silent and calm, but now Bambi knew what had awakened him. It was the smell of smoke.Moving more quickly, he trotted up a narrow path that led to a cliff. From the cliff, he knew, there was a clear view of the valley.And there below, a thin, curling line of smoke was rising from a campfire.""It is Man,"" came a deep, grave voice from behind Bambi. He turned and saw the old stag, the Great Prince of the Forest, standing beside him. As if in answer to the Great Prince's words, crows circling in the valley below began screaming raucously.""He is here again,"" said the old stag.""There are many this time. We must go deep into the forest. Come with me!""Before Bambi could speak, the stag had wheeled around and dashed into the woods.Bambi took a tentative step after him and then stopped. ""Faline!"" he cried aloud. In the thicket, the sound of the crows had awakened Faline. She looked around nervously for Bambi. Where had he gone? She, too, sensed something in the air. She called frantically for Bambi several times and searched for him near the thicket.But there was no answer.With each passing moment she became more frightened. Finally she ran in panic through the woods.Bambi reached the thicket only seconds after Faline had left. He was beside himself with fear for his loved one, and he darted off in search of her.The crows were above the treetops now. Their harsh shrieks of warning were beginning to wake up the whole forest. Eyes glanced up uneasily, and a few nervous forest creatures began creeping deeper into the woods, hardly daring to peek over their shoulders to see what was happening.But everyone knew what was happening. The crows' screams of danger could mean only one thing. The meadow was hushed and fearful. Three pheasants trembled in their hiding place under the deep grass. ""He's coming,"" faltered the youngest of the three.""Hush! Don't get excited!"" her older sister tried to soothe her.""He's . . . he's coming closer!"" wailed the first pheasant, unheeding. ""We'd better fly!""""No! Don't fly!"" gasped the other two pheasants. ""Whatever you do, don't fly!""The first pheasant was sobbing now. ""He's almost here!"" she wept, and her voice rose to a scream. ""I can't stand it any longer!"" Wings beating wildly, she threw herself into the air. There was a thunderous crack overhead, and her body fell from the sky.Instantly the shooting began in force. The animals hidden under the grass panicked at the sound. Terrified, they streaked across the meadow toward the forest. Birds flew shrieking into the sky - and dropped motionless out of it. The sound of gunshots came ever closer, and with it the crazed barking of the hunting dogs.Searching desperately for Bambi, Faline dashed up a rocky path. Suddenly, she turned and ran back in the other direction, chased by a large pack of snarling, barking dogs - Man's dogs.Faline ran and ran, the dogs biting at her heels. They seemed to be everywhere, and Fallne's only hope was to clamber up onto a high rocky ledge just out of their reach. ""Bambi!"" she cried frantically, ""Bambi!""The dogs yapped and growled, all the while leaping up at her. In the distance, Bambi heard the ominous howling and barking of the dogs and above the noise, Faline's terrified voice. He followed his senses to the spot where the vicious dogs had Faline cornered and without a moment's hesitation, he plunged into battle. With lowered head and strong thrusts, Bambi flipped one of the dogs over his antlers, but the rest of the snarling mass instantly turned on him.Bambi retreated a few paces, but only to charge again. This time he used his hoofs too, kicking wildly as he stabbed with his antlers.He reared up violently, shaking the dogs off, and then whirled around to attack again.""Quick, Faline! Jump!"" he called.Faline leaped off the ledge and disappeared into the forest.Bambi continued to fight valiantly, until finally he saw his opportunity to break away. He dashed up the steep bank behind the rocky ledge. The dogs were so close behind him that Bambi could feel their breath on his heels. He pulled himself up the bank with every bit of strength he had. The pack of dogs would certainly have reached him and torn him apart, if the frantic pawing of his hoofs hadn't started a rockslide as he neared the top of the bank.Now Bambi could hear the dogs' agonized yelps as rocks and boulders pelted them. But he didn't slow down. Ahead of him was a gorge. On the other side, he would be safe...He gathered his strength and sailed out over the chasm.A shot rang out and Bambi's body arched in agony. Then he hit the ground on the other side and sprawled there, unconscious...12. The wildfireDown in the valley, a passing breeze blew a handful of dry leaves onto the dying campfire. Soon a tiny flame sprang up and began licking at the grass. One second, it seemed, there was a forest. The next second, there was nothing but fire. The flames devoured everything they touched and, ravenous for more, rushed forward into the woods.Trees that had stood for hundreds of years groaned as the fire consumed them. Blazing embers fell into the stream and set it boiling. And hundreds upon hundreds of desperate animals raced only inches ahead of the flickering demon that was so eager to catch them.Bambi knew nothing of this. He was lying in a haze of pain at the edge of the gorge. Dimly he was aware of the heat and smoke, the crackling of the flames and the animals' screams, but none of it mattered to him.Then he heard a deep voice above him.""Get up, Bambi.""Bambi's eyes flickered, but he didn't move.""You must get up,"" repeated the voice.This time Bambi raised his head and stared dully at the Great Prince standing over him. Bambi tried to rise, but fell to the ground.""You must,"" said the stag sternly.Bambi didn't answer.""Get up!"" The stag's voice was harsh now.Bambi managed to pull himself shakily onto his knees. He was staggering so badly that he pitched forward. Pain coursed through his body. He would have collapsed again if the old stag hadn't been there.""And now, follow me,"" commanded the stag, and Bambi began stumbling along behind him.Then a sheet of fire raised itself up in front of the two deer. The scorching blast of heat cleared the pain from Bambi's head. Now he understood the danger they were in, He skidded along the gorge behind the stag, all thoughts of his injury forgotten.But everywhere the two deer turned, the mocking flames rose up in front of them. The Great prince wheeled around in the thick smoke and led Bambi to the stream. Huge tree trunks, glowing red, were toppling into the water all around them. Sizzling embers flew through the air like burning brands.This is the wrong direction! We're heading toward the waterfall! thought Bambi frantically. But looking backward, he realized they had no choice. Behind them was a solid wall of fire.The noise of the waterfall was drowning out even the sound of the flames. Bambi and the stag rushed ahead over the slippery rocks.Now they came to the very edge of the waterfall. Thirty feet below them, water churned and boiled furiously above the treacherous rocks.The two deer hesitated, but only for a second. Then they threw themselves over the edge and fell into the maelstrom below...13. ReunionA mile or so downstream, the water became wide and calm, though tinged with the reflections of flames leaping high into the air. I the middle of the river there was a tiny island where the creatures of the forest were taking refuge.Animals who had never touched water except to drink it were swimming carefully across the river now. A possum came slowly toward shore, her babies hanging upside down from her tail like a row of ornaments. Mrs. Raccoon laid the last baby of her damp brood down on the sandy bank and began licking its fur to warm it. Faline was standing at one end of the island, watching the water anxiously. Since she had fled from the dogs, she had seen no sign of Bambi. Surely no animals could still be alive in the forest, and it seemed like hours since she had crossed the water herself . . . then she gave a gasp of relief. Coming slowly across the river were the Great Prince and Bambi.Bambi had no idea whether Faline had made it to safety. His wound was beginning to ache again and he was conscious of how very tired he was. Just a little farther, he told himself as he struggled along searching the shoreline hopefully. Just a ... little farther . . .""Bambi!"" calle'd Faline eagerly.Bambi looked up and met her eyes. A burst of joy surged through him. She was safe!His pain and exhaustion vanished, and he swam the last few yards easily. Then he was on shore, standing once again next to Faline. Bambi gazed silently into her eyes. There were no words for what he was feeling. He and Faline leaned wearily against each other and turned together to watch the forest. Above the remains of the trees, the sky was burning brighter than any sunset.14. The circle of LifeEven the blackened ruins of the forest held no power against spring. Another winter had ended, and now May's beautifying hand was passing lovingly across the charred landscape. Flowers were blooming everywhere. New leaves had sprouted from wounded branches, and a velvety coating of new spring grass was covering the scarred forest floor.The old owl's favorite tree had managed to escape the worst of the fire. He was dozing there peacefully one morning when Thumper and his four children dashed up to a fallen log under the tree.All four of them began drumming loudly and shouting up at the owl. ""Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl!"" called Thumper excitedly.""Wake up, Friend Owl!"" echoed the little rabbits.The owl let out a little wail. ""Oh, what now?"" he said irritably, blinking down at the rabbits.""It's happened! It's happened!"" cried Thumper. Before the owl could ask any questions, the rabbits had dashed away.Next Flower came scurrying past. ""In the thicket!"" he explained to the mystified owl. ""Come on, Bambi!"" he then called out over his shoulder.""Yes, Papa, I'm coming,"" came a tiny voice behind himand a baby skunk waddled along after his father.Now that the Owl looked around, he could see that everyone in the forest seemed to be hurrying toward the thicket. Even the moles were tunneling along faster than usual, and Mrs. Quail's new line of chicks could hardly keep up with her. Still complaining under his breath, he launched himself into the sweet-smelling air.Faline was lying down in the thicket when the owl got there. Curled up next to her, staring wonderingly at the animals pressed around the thicket, was a tiny, perfect fawn.The spitting image of his father at that age,"" said the owl. ""Congratula . . .""Suddenly he broke off. At the sound of his voice, a second fawn's head had popped up from behind her brother. She gazed at the owl in amazement, then gave him a shy smile.""Two of them!"" gasped Mrs. Raccoon. The old owl chuckled. ""Yes, sir! I don't think I've ever seen a more likely-looking pair of fawns,"" he told Faline, who smiled graciously. ""Prince Bambi must be mighty proud.""And he was. Bambi was standing guard on a cliff high above the thicket, where he could take in everything at a single glance -the thicket with his new family inside, the adoring circle of animals who were his friends, the forest springing into new life, and beyond, the wide green meadow-As he gazed down over the scene, the Great Prince stood at his side. For a few minutes they watched the thicket together in silence. Slowly the old stag turned his serene gaze to Bambi, as if in farewell. Then without looking back, the Great Prince turned and walked away, leaving Bambi alone on the cliff.Bambi's heart was full. Sadness at the old stag's passing mingled with joy at the birth of his children and his love for Faline. He straightened his shoulders and lifted his head proudly. In the golden sunrise, he was a majestic figure indeed, the new Prince of the Forest.THE END","

    Synopsis
    1. A miracle in the woodsIn the depth of the forest, dawn was breaking. Trees grew so thickly here, that the morning first rays of sunlight could hardly break trough. The air was still and blue with mist. The faint, silvery sound of a distant waterfall was the only noise to be heard.A few drowsy birds were just beginning to greet the new day as a huge old owl swooped silently towards the hollow tree where he made his home. The world was waking up all around him. A little wood-mouse slipped out of her nest to wash her face in a dewdrop. Three baby sparrows cheeped shrilly as their mother brought them their first meal of the day: A cluster of berries. And with every second, the pale sunbeams grew brighter.The young rabbit Thumper, who was always the first of his family to arise, was waking up slowly, yawning and scratching as he did every morning.
But the owl was ready for bed. With a sigh he alighted on a branch, waddled into his hole, and fluffed up his feathers. His drowsy eyes dipped shut, and he fall asleep.
He didn't get to stay asleep very long.
A bluebird darted trough the air to perch on the tree next to the owl's. He twittered, and flew off.
From every corner, animals popped out of their hiding places and raced after her. Mrs. Quail moved swiftly along the forest floor, her babies trailing after her as if they were on a string.Thumper's sisters burst out of their house, tumbling over each other and their brother in their anxiety to get to the thicket first. Thumper dashed to the foot of the owl's tree and began drumming frantically on the ground with his right foot. ""Wake up! Wake up!"" he hollered at the top of his lungs.The owl shook himself irritably and squinted down at Thumper. ""Oh, what now?"" he groaned.""Wake up, Friend Owl!"" the little rabbit persisted.""Why? What's going on around here, anyway?""""It's happened! The new prince is born!"" shouted Thumper. ""We're going to see him! Come on, you'd better hurry up!"" And he dashed into the underbrush after his sisters. ""The new prince!"" The owl gave his feathers a hasty preening and soared into the air.The prince was a tiny fawn, only two hours old. When the animals reached the thicket where he had been born, he was curled up, sound asleep, next to his mother's warm side.
He didn't even stir as the creatures of the forest gathered into a circle around him.
""Oh, my!"" said Mrs. Raccoon with a wistful sigh. ""Isn't he just the most-""""Oh, my! Beautiful!"" echoed hushed maternal voices from all around the circle.
""Yes, indeed,"" said the owl from a bough overhead. ""This is, em, quite an occasion. Yes, sir. It isn't every day a prince is born.""He bent low in a courtly bow to the fawn's mother. ""You are to be congratulated.""
""Thank you,"" said the prince's mother quietly. She leaned over and gave her baby a loving nudge. ""Wake up,"" she whispered. ""Come on, dear. We have company.""Slowly, slowly the tiny fawn's head lifted. He stared wonderingly at the creatures standing in front of him.""Hello, Prince!"" squeaked a mouse timidly. At once a chorus of greetings sprang up, and the owl let out a loud ""hoo-hoo"" so loud that the fawn turned away and burrowed his face into his mother's side. Then he gathered up his courage and peeked out again. And this time he managed a shy smile.""Look!"" called Thumper excitedly. ""He's trying to get up!""He was, but it wasn't working very well.
Try as he might, the fawn couldn't get his slender legs to work together.
""He's kinda wobbly, isn't he?"" noted Thumper.""Thumper!"" gasped Mrs. Rabbit. She gave a flustered smile at the fawn's mother.
Thumper scowled. ""But he is,"" he muttered, kicking at the ground in embarrassment. ""Aren't you?"" he asked the fawn.
The fawn nodded eagerly. He hadn't understood a word.
The owl chuckled. ""Looks to me like he's getting kind of sleepy,"" he said. ""I think it's time we all left.""There was a murmur of protest from the younger animals. But the owl leaned over and fixed such a schoolmasterish glare on the crowd that they began to melt into the woods without another word.
Only Thumper still lingered in the thicket.
""Whatcha gonna call him?"" he asked the fawn's mother when everyone else had left.She smiled at him. ""Well, I think I'll call him Bambi,"" she answered.
Thumper frowned thoughtfully, as if the choice were up to him. ""Bambi,"" he repeated, trying it out.""Bambi. Yup, I guess that'll do all right."" And he hopped off to find his family.
Bambi's mother glanced down at her baby, who was sound asleep again.""Bambi,"" she murmured tenderly. ""My little Bambi.""As the mother and child settled down together, high on the hill above the thicket the Great Prince of the Forest kept watch.2. Exploring the forest""Walking already, well, what do you know?"" commented the gray squirrel as Bambi and his mother strolled through the forest. Bambi was three days old now. As far as he was concerned, he was the best walker the forest had ever seen, though sometimes his legs did get tangled. And he was proud that so many of the forest creatures had gotten the chance to see him.He had met Mrs. Quail and her babies scurrying through the underbrush as though they were late for an appointment. He had met Mrs. Possum and her babies, all hanging jauntily upside down from a tree branch. He had met Mr. Mole, who had popped up right under Bambi's nose. ""Good mornin',"" Mr. Mole had said politely. ""Nice, sunny day."" He had squinted up at the bright sky, winced a little, and returned with relief to his tunneling. The curious little fawn tried to follow the mole's path, but wound up tumbling over some reeds as his mother and the rabbit family looked on.""He doesn't walk very well, does he?"" asked Thumper with interest.""Thumper!"" scolded his mother. ""What did your father tell you this morning?""Thumper sighed. ""If you can't say somethin' nice... Don't say nothin' at all,'"" he muttered, frowning down at the ground.Bambi's mother leaned over and nuzzled Bambi's shoulder a little. ""Come on, Bambi,"" she urged gently. ""Get up. Try again.""
""Come on! Come on!"" squealed Thumper and his sisters excitedly. ""Get up! Get up! You can do it!""And after he'd managed to sort his legs out, Bambi pranced happily off after his new friends.
But, trying to follow the little rabbits, the young deer had difficulties with a large log lying across the path.""C'mon, you can do it,"" encouraged Thumper.""Hop over it. Like this."" All the bunnies chimed in as they leapt back and forth over the log, ""Hop over it! Hop over it!""Bambi stepped back to gather momentum, but his hop landed him smack-dab on top of the log.""You didn't hop far enough,"" said Thumper wisely.Bambi finally got all of himself over the log, but in the process his legs became tangled once more, causing the bunnies all to scatter just in case he might fall on them.3. Learning to speakAlong the path, Bambi and his companions came upon a flock of delighted finches who had discovered a bush full of delicious wild berries.Bambi looked inquiringly at Thumper.""Those are birds,"" Thumper told him.""B-burr?"" Bambi repeated.He hadn't had the faintest idea that the word was going to pop out of him, and neither had the rabbits. ""Hey! He talked!"" yelled Thumper. ""He's trying to say 'bird'!""""Burr!"" Bambi said again.""Huh-uh."" Thumper never missed the chance to be instructive. He clambered up onto a rock and looked Bambi in the eye. ""Say Bir-d;"" he ordered.""Burr,"" Bambi said.""'Bir-duh!"" insisted Thumper.This conversation had taken the finches' attention off the berries. Now they got into the act, too. ""Say bird!"" they peeped excitedly, darting around and around Bambi's head. ""Say bird! Saybirdsaybirdsaybirdsaybird!""""BIRD!""shouted Bambi-so loudly that the little rabbits and finches were scattered helter-skelter. ""Bird!"" he repeated in delight.
Thumper's sisters ran back to tell their mother the news. ""He talked! He talked, Mama; the young prince said 'bird.'""Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird,"" sang Bambi happily.Just then another flying creature fluttered slowly toward Bambi and perched on the fawn's tail.
Bambi twisted around to stare at it. ""Bird!"" he exclaimed happily. ""It's not a bird,"" Thumper corrected him. ""It's a butterfly.""""B-butterfly?"" Bambi turned around to see the butterfly again. Now it, too, was gone.But over by the rocks the ground seemed to be covered with butterflies!
He raced over to them. ""Butterfly! Butterfly!"" he caroled joyfully.""No, they're flowers! Pretty flowers! See?"" Thumper buried his nose in a bunch of yellow petals and sniffed appreciatively. ""Pretty fl . . ."" Bambi's voice trailed off as he, too, began to sniff the flowers. When he raised his head, he was nose-to-nose with a baby skunk.""Flower!"" said Bambi proudly.""M-me?"" The skunk's eyes widened.He was interrupted by peals of laughter.""No, no, no, no, no!"" gurgled Thumper, rolling around and pounding the ground deliriously. ""That's not a flower! He's just a little...""""Oh, that's all right!"" the baby skunk interrupted hastily. He beamed shyly up at Bambi.""He can call me a flower if he wants to. I don't mind.""""Pretty!"" Bambi piped again. ""Pretty flower!""From the look of pure, grateful devotion the baby skunk gave him, it was clear that Bambi had made a friend for life.4. The thunderstormBambi and Thumper were making their way back to their mothers when a huge crack of thunder sounded directly overhead. Startled, Bambi turned to Thumper. Was this some kind of new game, too? But for once Thumper was looking a little uncertain. ""I... I think I'd better go home now,"" he said uneasily, and vanished into the underbrush.CRACK! came the thunder again, and a bolt of lightning sizzled in the sky. Bambi dashed, terrified, after his mother as the first raindrops began to fall.Back at the thicket, Bambi and his mother lay down, listening to the sound of the rain. Bambi yawned, ready for sleep, but just couldn't take his eyes off the falling raindrops.The wood mouse scurried along toward her home, stopping under toadstools whenever she could. A mother robin landed on her nest and quickly covered her three drenched fledglings with her wings.
It was dark now, but flashes of lightning kept illuminating the forest with eerie clarity.Thumper and the other rabbits huddled together under the roots of a tree and stared out fearfully at the storm. High up in his hollow tree, the owl grumbled a little and turned his back on the weather.
And as the storm passed, Bambi fell asleep beside his mother.5. On the meadowMother, what are we going to do today?"" asked Bambi as he followed her through the forest. It was still so early that he could barely see her through the mist. ""I'm going to take you to the meadow,"" his mother replied.Bambi paused to sniff curiously along the way, then scampered after his mother again. ""Meadow? What's the meadow?"" he asked.""It's a very wonderful place,"" his mother told him.""Then why haven't we been there before?"" asked Bambi.""You weren't big enough,"" his mother replied. They were coming up to a shallow stream now, and she showed him where to cross. The instant they were across, Bambi began chattering away again.""Mother, you know what? Thumper told me we're not the only deer in the forest!""""Well, he's right,"" said his mother. ""There are many deer in the forest besides us.""""Then why don't I ever see them?"" asked the little fawn plaintively.""You will, sometime."" Bambi was excited. ""Today? On the meadow?""""Perhaps,"" his mother told him. ""Hush, now. We're almost there."" And she led him up over a little hill.Bambi had never seen anything like the sight that greeted him on the other side. Stretching out in front of him was what looked like a whole world's worth of long, golden-green grass studded with wildflowers. On one side of the meadow a marshy pond so unlike the rushing streams Bambi knew from the forest was reflecting the peach-colored light in the dawn sky. And the sky! Before this, Bambi had only caught glimpses of the sky through the trees. Out here, why, it's bigger than everything! he marveled. And I never knew the sun was as big as that, or as round!
""The meadow!"" he cried exultingly, and raced down the slope toward it.
""No, Bambi! Wait!"" In his mother's voice was a note Bambi had never heard before. She streaked ahead of him, wheeled around, and planted herself in his path.""You must never rush out on the meadow,"" she panted. ""There might be danger!"" Then, more gently: ""Out there, we are unprotected. The meadow is wide and open, and there are no trees or bushes to hide us. So we have to be very careful. Wait here.""Chastened, Bambi shrank back into the underbrush.""I'll go out first,"" his mother continued. ""And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.""Only Bambi's frightened brown eyes could be seen as he huddled down in the brush and stared at his mother. Slowly and carefully, she stepped out onto the meadow and gazed across its expanse. Then she looked back at her son. ""Come on, Bambi,"" she called. ""It's all right.""Bambi crept timidly out toward her. His heart was pounding. ""Come on!"" his mother called. He walked hesitantly in her direction, then began to leap more courageously when suddenly she bounded away.
Startled, Bambi froze in his tracks, and then he realized that she was playing. He burst into laughter and dashed after her.
There was so much room for running on the meadow, and so much to look at! Butterflies brighter than any Bambi had seen in the forest floated leisurely above the flowers. In the sky birds soared and dove for the sheer fun of it, and in the grass Bambi found the rabbits nibbling clover.Bambi took a mouthful but was interrupted by Thumper. ""No, no, not that green stuff. Just eat the blossoms - that's the good stuff."" ""Thumper!!"" his mother called sternly. ""What did your father tell you?""
""About what?""""About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens,"" reminded his mother.""Oh, that one."" Thumper cleared his throat. "" 'Eating greens is a special treat... It makes long ears . . . And great big feet.' But it sure is awful stuff to eat!"" he added so just Bambi could hear. ""I made that last part up myself.""Bambi had chased a frog to the pond's edge when he noticed something strange. He had two reflections in the water. Hmmm. Maybe that's just the way things happen on the meadow, he thought as he bent closer to the pond's surface. To his surprise, only one of the reflections moved. The other stayed still, staring mischievously at him.Slowly Bambi lifted his head. There, standing next to him, was another fawn. A long-lashed, delicate-looking fawn who giggled when their eyes met.She giggled again and stepped toward him. Bambi scrambled backwards hastily. Then, as the other fawn took another step in his direction, he turned and dashed back toward the spot where he'd last seen his mother.To his surprise, she was standing next to another doe. ""Bambi, this is your aunt Ena,"" she said as Bambi rushed toward her. ""And that's little Faline.""But Bambi didn't want anything to do with little Faline. Wide-eyed and timid, he drew back behind his mother and peeked out from around one of her legs.
For a third time, Faline giggled. ""He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?"" she asked merrily.""Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello,"" her mother replied.""Hello, Bambi,"" Faline said boldly. Bambi retreated even farther behind his mother. ""I said, hello!""""Aren't you going to answer her?"" asked Bambi's mother.Scowling, he shook his head.""You're not afraid, are you?"" asked his mother, and he shook his head again. ""Well, then, go ahead!"" And she pushed him with her nose. ""Go on, say hello,"" she told him firmly, in a motherly, no-nonsense voice. Bambi cleared his throat. He pawed the ground a little. Then he glowered up at Faline.""H'lo,"" he croaked.That was all it took. The silly young Faline giggled and danced around Bambi, who was so shy and confused by her that he fell into a small pond.
Faline darted in and out of the pond's cattails, giving Bambi little kisses on his cheeks. Finally, forgetting his shyness, Bambi gave a surprising whoop and charged after her.6. The Great Prince of the ForestBambi and Faline were playing tag when they heard a low, thudding sound. They paused. Could this be another thunderstorm? No. Streaking out of the woods were more deer. Dozens of huge deer, bigger than Bambi could have dreamed. The thudding sound was the noise of their hoofs.Bambi stared at the bucks with awe. They were plunging back and forth across the meadow, leaping fearlessly off the highest boulders and grappling in play-combat. He could hardly believe he would ever grow into something so magnificent. Bambi began to show off with his own imitation of their leaps.Then, as he watched, the bucks grew still. As one, they turned to face the woods. They had all sensed someone coming. It was a mighty stag, far bigger than the rest, with massive antlers fully a yard across.
And something about the grave, unhurried way the stag moved toward the meadow told Bambi without any words that he was in the presence of majesty.Slowly, proudly, the stag advanced and walked up to the group of bucks without seeming to notice them. He was about to pass on by when instead he turned his great head and stared down at little Bambi in silence. Bambi stared back, frozen with awe. Then he smiled hesitantly at the huge stag.Not a flicker of expression crossed the stag's face. Only his ears twitched a little, as if he were surprised at Bambi's daring.
Bambi's smile faded away, and he felt himself growing shy again without knowing why.The stag continued his slow, stately procession through the meadow and did not look back.Suddenly Bambi became aware that his mother had walked up behind him. ""Mother, he stopped and looked at me,"" he whispered.""Yes, I know.""""Mother, why was everyone still when he came onto the meadow?""""Everyone respects him,"" his mother explained softly. ""For of all the deer in the forest, not one has lived half so long. He's very brave and very wise. That's why he's known as the Great Prince of the Forest.""She turned to watch the stag as he walked away. The old stag looked down on the meadow from a high ledge. He moved deeper into the forest, then halted, sensing something was wrong. Suddenly he turned and raced back through the forest and onto the meadow. Bambi saw the Great Prince charging back toward the other deer as if to warn them. Above him, a flock of crows was screaming crazily in the sky. Before Bambi could ask what was the matter, the other deer were crashing past him, running toward the forest. ""Faline!"" Bambi heard Ena scream, and Faline raced up to her mother's side. The two of them dashed out of sight. A panic-stricken pheasant whirred up into the air directly in front of Bambi. All about him were the thundering of deer hoofs and the screams of terrified birds.The little fawn stood stock-still in the grass watching bewilderedly as the other deer hurtled past him. ""Bambi!"" he heard his mother calling from far away, but so many creatures were blocking his view that he couldn't see her.""Mother!"" he called desperately. ""Mother, where are you?""No answer.""Mother!"" Bambi screamed.Then, without any warning, the great Prince was at his side. Together they raced toward the edge of the forest, where Bambi's mother caught up to them. The three deer dashed to safety just as a shattering explosion rang through the air. Then the only sounds on the meadow were the echo of the shot and the crows' screams...It was sunset before Bambi's mother felt it was safe to come out of hiding. ""Come on out, Bambi,"" she said gently.Bambi didn't budge from his spot deep inside the thicket.""Come on,"" she urged. ""It's safe now. We don't have to hide any longer.""
Bambi poked his head out cautiously. When he saw that all was still, he pulled himself out of the thicket little by little and walked, trembling, up to his mother.""What happened, Mother? Why did we all run?"" he asked in a shaky voice.After a long pause she said quietly, ""Man... was in the forest.""Suddenly the air seemed very cold.7. Skating on iceTo Bambi, each golden summer day was like the ones that had come before. Autumn crept in so gradually that year that he hardly noticed the trees changing colors until they began to lose their leaves.
First one scarlet maple leaf tore itself loose, then a handful of yellow oak leaves - and then it seemed to Bambi that the whole forest was filled with scraps of color dancing in the wind.
Bambi was sure that the last two leaves on the oak tree just outside his thicket meant to stay put forever. Each morning he ran to see whether they were still there, and each morning they were still fluttering bravely on their branch. One day, though, Bambi glanced up to see the smaller of the two leaves shuddering in the breeze. With a sound like a sigh, it broke loose and floated gently to the ground.
Only a few seconds later its companion drifted down to lie beside it.
The next morning Bambi woke up early, with a sense that something had changed in the night. The air was frosty and cold, and the thicket was filled with a strange bluish-white light. He went to the thicket's opening to explore, and gasped.""Mother, look!"" he cried. ""What's all that white stuff?""His mother lifted her head. ""Why, it's snow!"" she said in surprise.""Snow?"" asked Bambi, staring at the brand new forest.""Yes,"" his mother told him. ""Winter has come.""Bambi took a cautious step into the white drift outside the thicket- ""Look. Footprints!"" he said in delight. Just then, Thumper called from a nearby snow-covered hill.""Hi ya, Bambi! Watch what I can do. Yippee!"" He ran down the hill, leaped out onto the water, which was no longer water but ice, and slid far out on the pond. ""C'mon, it's all right. Look, the water's stiff.""
But when Bambi took a mighty leap from the same hill, his ""Yippee"" abruptly ended in an ""Ooof"" and he wound up on his belly. Thumper called out to him, ""Some fun, huh, Bambi?""Bambi responded with a very weak smile. Try as he might, he could not stand on the slippery surface, and his attempts gave Thumper a bad case of the giggles. Through his laughter Thumper managed to say, ""No, no' Ya gotta watch both ends at the same time."" He decided it was time for him to take charge.First Thumper pushed one of Bambi's legs up and then another, then another and another until Bambi stood shakily. But Bambi's legs would not stay put and down he went again. This time his legs got all tied up.
""I guess you'd better unwind it,"" Thumper volunteered.Again Thumper got all of Bambi's legs in position, and giving him a good push, together they slid across the ice. For a moment, Thumper's plan seemed to be working, but not for long. Smack! They slid into the biggest snowbank.As Thumper's head popped up out of the snow, he heard a tiny whistling noise coming from a burrow in the side of a hill. Curious, they headed over to see what it was and found Flower, the skunk, lying on his back in a nest of leaves, sound asleep and snoring.""Wake up, wake up!"" said Thumper.Flower opened a drowsy eye. ""Is it spring yet?"" he murmured dreamily.""No!"" said Bambi incredulously. ""Winter's just starting!""""Mmmmm-hmmmmm,"" sighed Flower.""Whatcha doin'?"" asked the curious Thumper. ""Hibernatin?""""Mmmmm-hmmmmm,"" said Flower again.""Whatcha want to do that for?""asked Bambi.Flower chuckled a little- ""All us flowers sleep in the winter,"" he said with a yawn. ""Well, g'night. . .""He pulled his fluffy tail over himself like a quilt, snuggled down into the leaves, and went back to sleep.8. Death on the meadowAs the days grew shorter and the snow grew deeper, winter stopped being fun and became wearisome. Now it seemed to Bambi as though he were always limping along through the snowdrifts, always trying to catch up to the rest of the deer, always fighting the icy wind, always hungry and cold.The deer in the forest had banded together to look for food. For hours every day they struggled through the woods in search of the scraps of bark and twigs that were all the forest offered them now.
When Bambi's mother had first torn a piece of bark off a tree and gave it to him, he had been shocked at how dry and tasteless it was. And later even the bark grew scarce. Sometimes the two of them could only find enough for one. When that happened, his mother always went without.
Then came the day when they found no bark at all. In every direction, every tree they could see had been stripped higher than Bambi's mother could reach.Back in the thicket, Bambi curled up wearily next to his mother. ""Winter sure is long, isn't it?"" he said with a shiver.""It seems long, but it won't last forever."" His mother comforted him.
""I'm awfully hungry, Mother,"" whispered Bambi. His mother kissed him. ""Yes, dear, I know,"" she said patiently.So the weeks passed by, lean and bitter, until one morning Bambi's mother called happily, ""Bambi, come here!"" They had wandered to the meadow that morning, and she was standing near the brook staring down at something in the snow.Bambi scampered over. There in the snow was a patch of green!
""New spring grass,"" said his mother.
Bambi took an eager mouthful, and then another and another. The grass tasted of spring itself fresh, vibrant, leafy. It was a flavor he had almost forgotten after so many days of hard, dry bark. Bambi ate hungrily.Bambi's mother had barely started to eat when abruptly she stopped and lifted her head to sniff the air. She glanced from side to side as if she were trying to hear something.
""Bambi,"" she whispered. But he was so busy eating that he didn't hear her.""Bambi!"" she said in terror.Startled, Bambi looked up at her.""The thicket!"" she cried, and the two of them sprang toward the forest.
Bambi had never run so fast. He vaulted over the stream without thinking about it and dashed across the snow. He could hear his mother pounding along just behind him, her breath coming hard. ""Faster!"" she called out. ""Faster, Bambi!"" A shot rang out.Horrified, Bambi glanced back over his shoulder at his mother. ""Keep running! Keep running!"" she cried hoarsely. ""Don't look back!"" Another shot echoed in the air just as he reached the edge of the woods. He leaped forward, darting through the trees, and with a final burst of energy, tore through the underbrush, down the last steps of the old, familiar path, and into the thicket. There he stopped, gasping for breath.
""We ... we made it, Mother!"" he panted.""We made it!""There was no answer.""Mother?"" Bambi faltered.Silence.Bambi walked to the entrance of the thicket and peeked out into the woods.There was no sign of his mother. ""Mother!"" Bambi cried again. ""Mother, where are you?"" A light snow was beginning to fait. Trembling, Bambi cautiously left the thicket. His mother was nowhere in sight.
Where could she be? He knew she was out there somewhere. Why didn't she answer?""Mother!""The forest had become dark and ominous. The trees seemed bigger and taller and less friendly. The snow was coming down harder now. Bambi tried to retrace his steps, but his tracks were already completely covered. In the muffled silence of the new snow, there was no sound other than his bewildered cries.He called again and again, ""Mother . . . Mother!"" Desperately Bambi searched for her, stumbling through the snowfall that was now so dense he could scarcely see where he was going. His heart was beating so hard that he could not think. He had never known fear like this before, or such loneliness.""Mother,"" he wept, and his head bent low. His last cry froze in his throat and became a startled gasp.A huge, dark shape loomed above him. It was the old stag Bambi had once seen on the meadow. The Great Prince of the Forest. He was staring down at the little fawn, his face hidden in shadow.""Your mother can't be with you anymore,"" he said quietly.Bambi gave one wild, beseeching glance up at the stag. Then, stricken, he bowed his head. A single tear rolled down his cheek and vanished into the snow.""Come... my son,"" said the stag.He turned and walked back into the forest.Bambi looked once -only once- toward the spot where he had last seen his mother.Then, slowly, he began to follow the Great Prince and soon both disappeared in the upcoming blizzard...9. Twitterpated!Winter had come and gone once more and now once again the last patches of snow had melted reluctantly away. The plants in the forest, freed from winter's icy grasp, were springing joyously into life. Sun poured through the new leaves and splashed down onto the wildflowers. The trees were filled with blossoms and birds, the air with fragrance and birdsong. There wasn't a crevice or a cranny in the forest that spring had left untouched.Not that any of this pleased the old owl, who despised spring. He hated all the sunlight and the twittering and the way every tree he tried to take a nap in was filled with lovestruck birds.""Same thing every spring,"" he grumbled.""Tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet! Love's sweet song, huh? Pain in the pinfeathers, I call it... What's that? What's that? Oh, now what's going on?""The sapling he was perched in had suddenly begun to vibrate as though an earthquake were shaking it. It flung the surprised owl right off his perch.
He landed with a feather-shaking thump on a branch below. ""Ouch!"" he yelled. ""Stop it! Get out of here! All of you!"" Crossly he peered down at the handsome, broad-shouldered young buck who had been polishing his antlers against the tree trunk. ""And you, too,"" he added, almost falling off his branch again.
At the sight of the owl, the young buck broke into a smile. ""Hello, Friend Owl!"" he called gaily. ""Don't you remember me?""
""Why. . . why . . . why, it's the young prince'"" gasped the owl, his frown vanishing completely.Bambi nodded.""I see you've traded in your spots for a pair of antlers,"" observed the owl, and Bambi lifted his head proudly. ""Very impressive. You know, just the other day I was wondering what had become of you.""""Hello, Bambi!"" called an eager voice, cutting short the owl's pleasantries. ""I thought that might be you'""It was Thumper! But this Thumper was just as changed as Bambi himself. Gone were the baby roundness of his face and the fluffiness of his little body. He was trim, lean, and sleek now - the perfect specimen of a wild rabbit.As the two friends greeted each other, they heard another voice calling, ""Hi ya, fellas!"" They turned to see Flower waving at them from a patch of daisies. He, too, had grown up, but his smile was as sweet as ever. He was just as bashful as ever, too. When Bambi and Thumper turned toward him, he dropped his head shyly and began sniffing the daisies as though that was what he'd been meaning to do all along.
Just then a pair of meadowlarks flew playfully past Flower, zooming around his head almost making him dizzy. The birds chased each other around Bambi's new antlers and played tag over Thumper's head for just a moment before spinning gaily in circles and darting away again.
""Well, what's the matter with them?"" Flower asked in amazement. ""Why are they acting that way?""""Don't you know?"" the owl asked them.The three friends shook their heads. ""They're twitterpated!"" the owl explained.""Twitterpated?"" echoed Bambi.""Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the springtime!"" said the owl. Bambi, Thumper, and Flower stared blankly at him, so he explained further.""For example: You're walking along, minding your own business -looking neither to the left nor to the right- when all of a sudden, you run smack into a pretty face. Hoo-hoo!""The owl's voice was dripping with sarcasm.""You begin to get weak in the knees,"" he continued. ""Your head's in a whirl. And before you know it, you're walking on air!""He glowered down at them. ""Knocks you for a loop, it does! And you completely lose your head . . . and it can happen to anybody, so you'd better be careful!""He aimed a cranky wing at Bambi. ""It could happen to you."" He pointed at Thumper. ""To you, too."" He pointed at Flower - and hesitated. ""Yes, it could even happen to you,"" the owl decided after a second. ""So you'd all better watch out!""""Well, it's not going to happen to me,"" said Thumper firmly.""Me neither,"" agreed Bambi.""Me neither!"" said Flower with great force.And with that the three friends marched off into the forest, each of them utterly determined to resist the charms of spring.But, as Flower passed a blossoming bush, he thought he heard it giggle. He hesitated ... he peered into the bush ... he couldn't believe it, but... the bush was blinking back at him. He started to run after Bambi and Thumper, but the bush giggled again.
Then a pretty girl skunk came out of the bush and with a whirling dance gave the startled Flower a kiss.
Flower was completely twitterpated. He giggled, shrugged his shoulders, and went off happily through the field of daisies with his new girlfriend, Thumper and Bambi were shocked as they watched the two skunk tails disappear together in the distance.In the forest glade ahead, a lovely girl bunny was preening herself. When she saw Thumper approaching . . . well, it was love at first sight- She cleared her throat prettily to get Thumper's attention as he went by.
Thumper stopped in midstride and just stared at her with his mouth open.
She began humming a song, then fluttered her eyelashes, and said in a sultry, musical voice, ""Hello.""
Thumper swallowed hard and said nothing; he was too twitterpated to respond at all.Bambi was appalled at Thumper's behavior and kept walking, leaving him behind under the girl bunny's magic spell. Bambi could hear her singing to Thumper in her soft, seductive voice, ""Lah, lah, lah, lah . . ."" and he could tell that Thumper loved every bit of it.
Bambi sighed as he walked slowly toward a stream to take a drink. Bambi bending his head to drink.Suddenly he choked on a mouthful of water. There, in the stream, was another reflection. He lifted his head slowly. Gazing at him with a faint smile on her face was a slender, graceful young doe.""Hello, Bambi,"" she said. ""Don't you remember me?""Bambi only stared at her, open-mouthed.""I am Faline.""Still smiling, Faline advanced across the stream toward him.
He took a hasty step backward and tripped over a rock in the stream. Splash! He collapsed in a gawky heap and stared up at Faline. Her smile didn't waver. She looked breathtakingly composed as she continued across the stream toward Bambi.Bambi gathered himself up and clambered backward up the bank of the stream. He might have gotten away, too, if his brand new antlers hadn't become tangled in the branch of an apple tree.Pink petals showered gently down as Bambi shook his head frantically, trying to free himself. But before he'd made any progress, Faline walked up to him, and kissed him on the cheek.Bambi caught his breath. He turned his head toward Faline and stared into her huge, dark eyes.The forest suddenly seemed to Bambi like a cloud-filled sky and he felt as though he could fly, Faline scampered across the stream, paused to look back at Bambi teasingly, then sprang up the bank. Bambi leaped after her, and the two of them bounded off through the forest.10. Fighting bucksSuddenly someone thrust himself between them. It was another buck. Ronno! He was bigger than Bambi and heavier. He scowled fiercely at Bambi and shook his antlers threateningly and began pushing Faline up the path into the forest.""Bambi!"" cried a frightened Faline.Suddenly anger blazed through Bambi and burned his fear completely away. He began to paw the ground with his hoof. Ronno pawed the ground himself and thundered toward Bambi. They grappled antlers for only a second before Ronno flung the younger buck over his shoulder.""Bambi!"" cried Faline in alarm.Bambi hit the ground with a bone-shaking thud. For a minute he lay there motionless, the wind knocked out of him. Then, as Ronno charged toward him again, he staggered to his feet and aimed his antlers at Ronno's chest.Again they grappled and again Ronno threw Bambi into the air.
Bambi pulled himself up painfully and stood on his hind legs as Ronno charged. This time the bucks fought with their front hoofs, slashing viciously at each other while a trembling Faline watched. At first she was sure Ronno was going to win the battle. But, little by little, the bigger buck began to tire. He had never before had to fight so long or so hard.He's starting to give up! Bambi exulted as he pushed Ronno backward yet again. They were fighting on the edge of a rain-filled gully now. Bambi gritted his teeth and hurled himself into the air, hitting Ronno with the whole of his weight.Ronno stumbled backward and lost his footing. With a furious shout he tumbled head over heels down the gully and into the water.
Ronno shook his head as if to clear it. Then he rose and gave Bambi a bewildered look. He shook his head again and stumbled away through the water.Faline tiptoed up to Bambi's side. She laid her head lovingly on his shoulder. And together they walked through the mists out onto the beauty of the meadow.11. Man returnsOne chilly gray autumn dawn, Bambi woke up with a start. Faline was still sleeping peacefully beside him in the thicket. None of the birds were awake yet, and except for a few falling leaves, the woods seemed still. Yet Bambi was sure there was something wrong. He stood up quietly, so as not to wake Faline, and stepped cautiously out of the thicket.The forest was silent and calm, but now Bambi knew what had awakened him. It was the smell of smoke.
Moving more quickly, he trotted up a narrow path that led to a cliff. From the cliff, he knew, there was a clear view of the valley.
And there below, a thin, curling line of smoke was rising from a campfire.
""It is Man,"" came a deep, grave voice from behind Bambi. He turned and saw the old stag, the Great Prince of the Forest, standing beside him. As if in answer to the Great Prince's words, crows circling in the valley below began screaming raucously.""He is here again,"" said the old stag.""There are many this time. We must go deep into the forest. Come with me!""Before Bambi could speak, the stag had wheeled around and dashed into the woods.Bambi took a tentative step after him and then stopped. ""Faline!"" he cried aloud. In the thicket, the sound of the crows had awakened Faline. She looked around nervously for Bambi. Where had he gone? She, too, sensed something in the air. She called frantically for Bambi several times and searched for him near the thicket.But there was no answer.With each passing moment she became more frightened. Finally she ran in panic through the woods.Bambi reached the thicket only seconds after Faline had left. He was beside himself with fear for his loved one, and he darted off in search of her.The crows were above the treetops now. Their harsh shrieks of warning were beginning to wake up the whole forest. Eyes glanced up uneasily, and a few nervous forest creatures began creeping deeper into the woods, hardly daring to peek over their shoulders to see what was happening.But everyone knew what was happening. The crows' screams of danger could mean only one thing. The meadow was hushed and fearful. Three pheasants trembled in their hiding place under the deep grass. ""He's coming,"" faltered the youngest of the three.""Hush! Don't get excited!"" her older sister tried to soothe her.""He's . . . he's coming closer!"" wailed the first pheasant, unheeding. ""We'd better fly!""""No! Don't fly!"" gasped the other two pheasants. ""Whatever you do, don't fly!""The first pheasant was sobbing now. ""He's almost here!"" she wept, and her voice rose to a scream. ""I can't stand it any longer!"" Wings beating wildly, she threw herself into the air. There was a thunderous crack overhead, and her body fell from the sky.Instantly the shooting began in force. The animals hidden under the grass panicked at the sound. Terrified, they streaked across the meadow toward the forest. Birds flew shrieking into the sky - and dropped motionless out of it. The sound of gunshots came ever closer, and with it the crazed barking of the hunting dogs.Searching desperately for Bambi, Faline dashed up a rocky path. Suddenly, she turned and ran back in the other direction, chased by a large pack of snarling, barking dogs - Man's dogs.Faline ran and ran, the dogs biting at her heels. They seemed to be everywhere, and Fallne's only hope was to clamber up onto a high rocky ledge just out of their reach. ""Bambi!"" she cried frantically, ""Bambi!""The dogs yapped and growled, all the while leaping up at her. In the distance, Bambi heard the ominous howling and barking of the dogs and above the noise, Faline's terrified voice. He followed his senses to the spot where the vicious dogs had Faline cornered and without a moment's hesitation, he plunged into battle. With lowered head and strong thrusts, Bambi flipped one of the dogs over his antlers, but the rest of the snarling mass instantly turned on him.Bambi retreated a few paces, but only to charge again. This time he used his hoofs too, kicking wildly as he stabbed with his antlers.
He reared up violently, shaking the dogs off, and then whirled around to attack again.""Quick, Faline! Jump!"" he called.Faline leaped off the ledge and disappeared into the forest.Bambi continued to fight valiantly, until finally he saw his opportunity to break away. He dashed up the steep bank behind the rocky ledge. The dogs were so close behind him that Bambi could feel their breath on his heels. He pulled himself up the bank with every bit of strength he had. The pack of dogs would certainly have reached him and torn him apart, if the frantic pawing of his hoofs hadn't started a rockslide as he neared the top of the bank.Now Bambi could hear the dogs' agonized yelps as rocks and boulders pelted them. But he didn't slow down. Ahead of him was a gorge. On the other side, he would be safe...He gathered his strength and sailed out over the chasm.
A shot rang out and Bambi's body arched in agony. Then he hit the ground on the other side and sprawled there, unconscious...12. The wildfireDown in the valley, a passing breeze blew a handful of dry leaves onto the dying campfire. Soon a tiny flame sprang up and began licking at the grass. One second, it seemed, there was a forest. The next second, there was nothing but fire. The flames devoured everything they touched and, ravenous for more, rushed forward into the woods.
Trees that had stood for hundreds of years groaned as the fire consumed them. Blazing embers fell into the stream and set it boiling. And hundreds upon hundreds of desperate animals raced only inches ahead of the flickering demon that was so eager to catch them.Bambi knew nothing of this. He was lying in a haze of pain at the edge of the gorge. Dimly he was aware of the heat and smoke, the crackling of the flames and the animals' screams, but none of it mattered to him.
Then he heard a deep voice above him.""Get up, Bambi.""Bambi's eyes flickered, but he didn't move.""You must get up,"" repeated the voice.This time Bambi raised his head and stared dully at the Great Prince standing over him. Bambi tried to rise, but fell to the ground.""You must,"" said the stag sternly.Bambi didn't answer.""Get up!"" The stag's voice was harsh now.Bambi managed to pull himself shakily onto his knees. He was staggering so badly that he pitched forward. Pain coursed through his body. He would have collapsed again if the old stag hadn't been there.""And now, follow me,"" commanded the stag, and Bambi began stumbling along behind him.Then a sheet of fire raised itself up in front of the two deer. The scorching blast of heat cleared the pain from Bambi's head. Now he understood the danger they were in, He skidded along the gorge behind the stag, all thoughts of his injury forgotten.But everywhere the two deer turned, the mocking flames rose up in front of them. The Great prince wheeled around in the thick smoke and led Bambi to the stream. Huge tree trunks, glowing red, were toppling into the water all around them. Sizzling embers flew through the air like burning brands.This is the wrong direction! We're heading toward the waterfall! thought Bambi frantically. But looking backward, he realized they had no choice. Behind them was a solid wall of fire.The noise of the waterfall was drowning out even the sound of the flames. Bambi and the stag rushed ahead over the slippery rocks.
Now they came to the very edge of the waterfall. Thirty feet below them, water churned and boiled furiously above the treacherous rocks.
The two deer hesitated, but only for a second. Then they threw themselves over the edge and fell into the maelstrom below...13. ReunionA mile or so downstream, the water became wide and calm, though tinged with the reflections of flames leaping high into the air. I the middle of the river there was a tiny island where the creatures of the forest were taking refuge.Animals who had never touched water except to drink it were swimming carefully across the river now. A possum came slowly toward shore, her babies hanging upside down from her tail like a row of ornaments. Mrs. Raccoon laid the last baby of her damp brood down on the sandy bank and began licking its fur to warm it. Faline was standing at one end of the island, watching the water anxiously. Since she had fled from the dogs, she had seen no sign of Bambi. Surely no animals could still be alive in the forest, and it seemed like hours since she had crossed the water herself . . . then she gave a gasp of relief. Coming slowly across the river were the Great Prince and Bambi.Bambi had no idea whether Faline had made it to safety. His wound was beginning to ache again and he was conscious of how very tired he was. Just a little farther, he told himself as he struggled along searching the shoreline hopefully. Just a ... little farther . . .
""Bambi!"" calle'd Faline eagerly.Bambi looked up and met her eyes. A burst of joy surged through him. She was safe!
His pain and exhaustion vanished, and he swam the last few yards easily. Then he was on shore, standing once again next to Faline. Bambi gazed silently into her eyes. There were no words for what he was feeling. He and Faline leaned wearily against each other and turned together to watch the forest. Above the remains of the trees, the sky was burning brighter than any sunset.14. The circle of LifeEven the blackened ruins of the forest held no power against spring. Another winter had ended, and now May's beautifying hand was passing lovingly across the charred landscape. Flowers were blooming everywhere. New leaves had sprouted from wounded branches, and a velvety coating of new spring grass was covering the scarred forest floor.The old owl's favorite tree had managed to escape the worst of the fire. He was dozing there peacefully one morning when Thumper and his four children dashed up to a fallen log under the tree.
All four of them began drumming loudly and shouting up at the owl. ""Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl!"" called Thumper excitedly.
""Wake up, Friend Owl!"" echoed the little rabbits.
The owl let out a little wail. ""Oh, what now?"" he said irritably, blinking down at the rabbits.""It's happened! It's happened!"" cried Thumper. Before the owl could ask any questions, the rabbits had dashed away.Next Flower came scurrying past. ""In the thicket!"" he explained to the mystified owl. ""Come on, Bambi!"" he then called out over his shoulder.
""Yes, Papa, I'm coming,"" came a tiny voice behind himand a baby skunk waddled along after his father.Now that the Owl looked around, he could see that everyone in the forest seemed to be hurrying toward the thicket. Even the moles were tunneling along faster than usual, and Mrs. Quail's new line of chicks could hardly keep up with her. Still complaining under his breath, he launched himself into the sweet-smelling air.Faline was lying down in the thicket when the owl got there. Curled up next to her, staring wonderingly at the animals pressed around the thicket, was a tiny, perfect fawn.The spitting image of his father at that age,"" said the owl. ""Congratula . . .""Suddenly he broke off. At the sound of his voice, a second fawn's head had popped up from behind her brother. She gazed at the owl in amazement, then gave him a shy smile.""Two of them!"" gasped Mrs. Raccoon. The old owl chuckled. ""Yes, sir! I don't think I've ever seen a more likely-looking pair of fawns,"" he told Faline, who smiled graciously. ""Prince Bambi must be mighty proud.""And he was. Bambi was standing guard on a cliff high above the thicket, where he could take in everything at a single glance -the thicket with his new family inside, the adoring circle of animals who were his friends, the forest springing into new life, and beyond, the wide green meadow-
As he gazed down over the scene, the Great Prince stood at his side. For a few minutes they watched the thicket together in silence. Slowly the old stag turned his serene gaze to Bambi, as if in farewell. Then without looking back, the Great Prince turned and walked away, leaving Bambi alone on the cliff.Bambi's heart was full. Sadness at the old stag's passing mingled with joy at the birth of his children and his love for Faline. He straightened his shoulders and lifted his head proudly. In the golden sunrise, he was a majestic figure indeed, the new Prince of the Forest.THE END

Mrs. Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London, England. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby and Judy (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) at university. They have live-in staff: Gladys the housemaid (Brenda Forbes) and Ada the cook (Marie De Becker).As World War II looms, Vin comes down from university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements (mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism) they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal.Several months later, as the war comes closer to home with the bombing of Great Brittan, Vin feels he must ""do his bit"" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the May-June 1940 Dunkirk evacuation.Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden and he holds her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot maniacally asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk.Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her granddaughter's comparative youth. Lady Beldon is unsuccessful and admits defeat when Kay reminds her that she, too, was young when she married her late husband. Lady Beldon concedes defeat and realises that she would be foolish to try and stop the marriage. Vin and Carol are married; Carol has now also become Mrs Miniver, and they return from their honeymoon in Scotland. A key theme is that she knows he is likely to be killed in action, but the short love will fill her life. Later, Kay and her family take refuge in their Anderson shelter in the garden during an air raid, and attempt to keep their minds off the frightening bombing by reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which Clem refers to as a ""lovely story"" as they barely survive a bomb destroys parts of the house. They take the damage with nonchalance.At the annual village flower show, Lady Beldon silently disregards the judges' decision that her rose is the winner, instead announcing the entry of the local stationmaster, Mr. Ballard (Henry Travers), named the ""Mrs. Miniver"" rose, as the winner, with her own rose taking second prize. As air raid sirens sound and the villagers take refuge in the cellars of Beldon Hall, Kay and Carol drive Vin to join his squadron. On their journey home they witness fighter planes in a 'dogfight'. For safety, Kay stops the car and they see the German plane crash. Kay realises Carol has been wounded by shots from the plane and takes her back to 'Starlings'. She dies a few minutes after they reach home. Kay is devastated. When Vin returns from battle, he already knows the terrible news. Unexpectedly he is the survivor, and she the one who gives her life for England.The villagers assemble at the badly damaged church where their vicar (Henry Wilcoxon) affirms their determination in a powerful sermon:""We in this quiet corner of England have suffered the loss of friends very dear to us, some close to this church. George West, choirboy. James Ballard, stationmaster and bellringer, and the proud winner only an hour before his death of the Beldon Cup for his beautiful Miniver Rose. And our hearts go out in sympathy to the two families who share the cruel loss of a young girl who was married at this altar only two weeks ago. The homes of many of us have been destroyed, and the lives of young and old have been taken. There's scarcely a household that hasn't been struck to the heart. And why? Surely you must have asked yourselves this question? Why in all conscience should these be the ones to suffer? Children, old people, a young girl at the height of her loveliness? Why these? Are these our soldiers? Are these our fighters? Why should they be sacrificed? I shall tell you why. Because this is not only a war of soldiers in uniform. It is the war of the people, of all the people. And it must be fought not only on the battlefield but in the cities and in the villages, in the factories and on the farms, in the home and in the heart of every man, woman and child who loves freedom. Well, we have buried our dead, but we shall not forget them. Instead they will inspire us with an unbreakable determination to free ourselves, and those who come after us, from the tyranny and terror that threaten to strike us down. This is the People's War. It is our war. We are the fighters. Fight it then. Fight it with all that is in us. And may God defend the right.""A solitary Lady Beldon stands in her family's church pew. Vin moves to stand alongside her, united in shared grief, as the members of congregation rise and stoically sing ""Onward, Christian Soldiers"", while through a gaping hole in the bombed church roof can be seen flight after flight of RAF fighters in the V-for-Victory formation heading out to face the enemy.","

                    A suspicious fire destroys a Los Angeles based military aircraft factory. An employee at the factory, Barry Kane, whose best friend perished in the fire, is implicated as the saboteur. Kane believes that a man that he met at the factory site that day by the name of Frank Frye is the true saboteur. Frye was acting as if he was an employee at the factory, but records show no employee by that name. With only memory of an envelope with Frye's name and address as a lead, Kane goes on the run from the police to track down Frye. Kane's search for Frye takes a turn when he meets Patricia Martin. Initially suspect of Kane, Pat ends up believing Kane's story and trusting him as a person. In their search for the truth in an effort to clear Kane's name, they discover a plot much larger and more dangerous than Kane could have ever imagined when he started his quest.

As part of the company's rehearsal of ""Gestapo"", a play satirizing the Nazis, one of the actors, Bronski (Tom Dugan), takes to the street to prove that he looks like Hitler in his costume and makeup. People gawk at the appearance of the Nazi dictator in Warsaw, until a young girl asks for the autograph of ""Mr. Bronski.""That night, when the company is performing Shakespeare's Hamlet, with Tura in the title role, Bronski commiserates with his friend and colleague, Greenberg (Felix Bressart), about being limited to being spear carriers. Greenberg, who is Jewish, reveals that it has always been his dream to perform Shylock in Merchant of Venice, especially the famous ""Hath not a Jew eyes?"" speech.Meanwhile, Maria has received a bouquet of flowers from the handsome young pilot Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). She arranges to meet him, telling Sobinski to come to her dressing room when Tura begins his ""To be or not to be..."" speech, so they can be sure of privacy. The young man walks out, very obviously, when Tura begins his monologue, causing the highly-strung actor great distress. Shortly thereafter, the company is ordered by a government representative to cancel their production of ""Gestapo"" out of fear it would offend the Germans and upset the tensions between the two nations.The next night, after a brief (and chaste) assignation, Sobinski again walks out during ""To be or not to be"", freshly infuriating Tura. Sobinski returns backstage to confess his love to Maria, assuming that she will leave her husband and the stage to be with him. Before she can correct his assumption, news breaks out that Germany has invaded Poland. Sobinski leaves to join the fight, and the actors huddle in the basement of the theater as Warsaw is decimated by bombings.Hitler conquers Poland, and the Polish division of the British Royal Air Force is fighting to free its mother country. Lt. Sobinski and other young pilots of the division sing together, with the Polish resistance leader Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges) as their guest. Siletsky hints he will return to Warsaw soon, and the men jump to give him messages for their relatives, but Sobinski is suspicious when he gives Siletsky a message for Maria Tura and he doesn't know who the famous actress is. When Sobinski reports the incident to higher authorities, they realize that Siletsky now has a list of the names and addresses of relatives of Polish airmen in the RAF, against whom reprisals can be taken.Sobinski is sent to Warsaw to warn the resistance, but Siletsky gets there before him. The flier manages to reach Maria, who passes on the message to the underground. Immediately after, she is stopped by two soldiers, who have been ordered by Siletsky to bring her to him so he can deliver Sobinski's message and determine what ""To be or not to be"" means to her. Siletsky invites Maria to dinner, hoping to recruit her as a spy, as well as to sample her charms. She pretends to be interested and goes home to dress more appropriately for the occasion. Just before she arrives at her apartment, Tura returns and finds Sobinski in his bed and his bathrobe. Maria and Sobinski try to figure out what to do about Siletsky, while Tura tries to figure out what is going on with his wife and the pilot. In the end, Tura proclaims that he will kill Siletsky.Later that evening, Maria returns to Siletsky's room and pretends to be attracted to him. Just as they kiss, there is a knock at the door. A Nazi officer actually one of the members of the acting company summons Siletsky to ""Gestapo headquarters"", which is the theatre, hastily disguised with props and costumes from their play.Tura pretends to be Col. Ehrhardt of the Gestapo, and Siletsky gives him the report containing the names and addresses of the families of the Polish pilots. He also reveals that Sobinski gave him a message for Maria, and that ""To be or not to be"" was the signal for their rendezvous. Tura reacts in an extremely jealous way and declares he will have Maria arrested. Noting this overreaction, Siletsky quickly sees that he has been duped, pulls a gun on Tura and tries to escape, but is shot and killed by Sobinski. Tura returns to the hotel disguised as Siletsky in a fake beard and glasses, to destroy the copy of the information about the Polish resistance that Siletsky has in his trunk and to confront Maria about her affair. Unfortunately, he's met at the hotel by the real Col. Ehrhardt's adjutant, Capt. Schultz (Henry Victor), and taken to meet Ehrhardt himself (Sig Ruman). Tura manages to pass himself off as Siletsky, defuses the information by naming recently executed prisoners as the leaders of the resistance, and learns that Hitler himself will visit Warsaw the next day.The next day, the real Siletsky's body is discovered in the theater. Ehrhardt sends for Maria to tell her, but she is unable to warn Tura in time, and he arranges another meeting with Ehrhardt, again posing as Siletsky. When Tura arrives, Ehrhardt sends him into a room with Siletsky's dead body, hoping to frighten him into a confession. Thinking quickly, Tura shaves off Siletsky's beard and then attaches a spare fake beard that he was carrying in his pocket. He then calls Ehrhardt into the room and manipulates him into pulling Siletsky's now-fake beard off. This appears to prove that the real Siletsky was actually the imposter, but just as Tura is about to make his escape, the other actors, sent by Maria and again in Nazi costume, storm into Ehrhardt's office, yank off Tura's false beard and pretend to drag him away to prison. This gets Tura out of Gestapo headquarters, but now he cannot leave the country on the plane Ehrhardt had arranged for him, and it's only a matter of time before the ruse is discovered.The company now comes up with a bold plan. The Nazis stage a show at the theater to honor Hitler, and Sobinski, Tura, Bronski and the other actors sneak in dressed as Nazis. The actors hide until Hitler arrives and takes his seat, and then, as the Nazis are singing the German national anthem inside, Greenberg suddenly appears and rushes the box. This distracts the Führer's guards long enough for Bronski, now wearing a Hitler mustache, to emerge unnoticed from hiding, surrounded by his entourage of actors dressed as Nazi officers.Playing the head of Hitler's guard, Tura demands to know what Greenberg wants, and the actor finally gets his chance to deliver Shylock's famous speech from The Merchant of Venice. He ends with a ringing ""if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?!"" and Tura orders his ""officers"" to take Greenberg away. He also recommends that Bronski/Hitler leave Poland immediately, and all the actors march out, get in Hitler's cars and drive away.Back at her apartment, Maria is waiting for the actors to pick her up. They all intend to leave on Hitler's plane, but Col. Ehrhardt shows up and tries to seduce her. Ehrhardt is amazed, however, when the door opens and Bronski walks in disguised as Hitler. Bronski simply turns and walks out in silence, but Ehrhardt immediately thinks that Maria is having an affair with Hitler and he has just been caught trying to steal the Führer's mistress. Maria dashes after Bronski calling, ""Mein Führer, Mein Führer!""All the actors take off in the plane. They easily dispose of the Nazi pilots, and Sobinski flies the plane to Scotland, where the actors are interviewed by the press. Asked what reward he'd like for his service to the Allies, Tura hesitates in a show of false modesty, but Maria quickly responds for him, ""He wants to play Hamlet.""In the final scene, Tura is now once again on stage at a theater in London as Hamlet and reaches the moment of ""To be or not to be."" He sees Sobinski in the audience as he begins the speech, but both are amazed when a new young officer gets up and noisily heads backstage.","

    Synopsis
    Charlotte Vale is a dumpy, overweight spinster, never out of the sight of her domineering mother, the widowed matriarch of a wealthy Boston family. Charlotte has four older brothers and is always described by Mrs. Vale as an ugly duckling.Charlotte is high-strung and deeply depressed, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, due to the
constant squashing of her thoughts by her mother. There is a little spark of independence, though--she secretly smokes and expresses some creativity by carving ivory boxes.Then a psychiatrist, Dr. Jaquith, is invited to tea by her sister-in-law Lisa Vale. He tells Charlotte that he can help her, that he can show her which path to take at the fork in the road.After an ugly scene with her niece June Vale, who is Lisa's daughter but displays Mrs. Vale's cruelty, Charlotte finally accepts Dr. Jaquith's offer and goes to the mountain retreat where he works. The hospital offers the attention and crucial building up of her self-esteem. She changes from a mouse to an attractive figure of social grace and appeal.On a holiday cruise, Charlotte tries out her new persona, the test run that Dr. Jaquith encouraged to evaluate her level of recovery. She grows comfortable with her new image, no longer awkward in company but aloof enough to be interesting.A French gentleman, Jerry Durance, becomes fascinated with her and soon is so
in love with her that he can barely think of being without her. Charlotte loves him too,
but knows that their affair must never be known, for Jerry is married, but unhappily
tied to a wife who is cold, selfish and a hypochondriac. Yet he loves his children and
his emotionally troubled youngest daughter, Tina.They part ways, at last, much to the agony of Jerry and the silent desperation of
Charlotte.She returns to her home in Boston, and becomes involved with Elliot Livingston. But
she doesn't love him and soon the engagement is over. Even worse, after an argument with Charlotte, Mrs. Vale has another heart attack and dies.Charlotte returns to the clinic for a break, emotionally overwrought. She meets a young girl who is very shy and not overtly pretty. Soon she discovers it is Tina, the daughter of Jerry.Charlotte takes Tina under her wing, believing in the ugly duckling and knowing that
she can become a swan. After all, Tina is exactly how Charlotte was.How can she cope with seeing Jerry again, though? And know that Tina will never truly
be her daughter, her flesh and blood.Charlotte develops a maternal bond with Tina and hopes only for Jerry's love. Even though he can never leave his wife. But to Charlotte, Tina is a piece of him; together they can love her.And she believes that they have the stars together now, they mustn't ask for the moon.

                    The young, handsome, but somewhat wild Eugene Morgan wants to marry Isabel Amberson, daughter of a rich upper-class family, but she instead marries dull and steady Wilbur Minafer. Their only child, George, grows up a spoiled brat. Years later, Eugene comes back, now a mature widower and a successful automobile maker. After Wilbur dies, Eugene again asks Isabel to marry him, and she is receptive. But George resents the attentions paid to his mother, and he and his whacko aunt Fanny manage to sabotage the romance. A series of disasters befall the Ambersons and George, and he gets his come-uppance in the end.

                    The wealthy Ambersons have been the leading family of their middle American town since 1873, they who live in the grandest mansion in the center of the residential area of town. Most of the townspeople truly would like to be like the Ambersons, and as that probably will not happen they use the Ambersons as the focus of their gossip. That gossip largely centers on the beautiful Isabel Amberson: her courtship with passionate Eugene Morgan, who she truly does love; an incident by Eugene which results in Isabel deciding instead to marry the sensible businessman Wilbur Minafer, a man to who she is loyal but who she does not truly love; and that Isabel will focus all her love on her and Wilbur's children in the absence of any love for Wilbur. That prognostication is only partly true in that Isabel and Wilbur end up having only one child, George Minafer. The unconditional love Isabel has for George is akin to George being spoiled, in turn George having a complete sense of privilege and superiority which he carries into adulthood. The Minafer home is the Amberson mansion where they live with surviving members of the Amberson family, as well as Wilbur's plain spinster sister, Fanny Minafer. George's return home during a break from college coincides with Eugene also returning, he who left town twenty years ago after Isabel's marriage. Eugene is now a widower with a grown adult daughter Lucy Morgan, who turns the heads of most of the young men she meets. Eugene is an inventor whose latest invention, which is largely seen by traditionalists as a novelty, is a horseless carriage, i.e. an automobile. Eugene predicts that the automobile will ultimately change the face of life as they know it. George falls in love at first sight with Lucy, but takes an instant dislike to Eugene because of the attention Eugene pays toward his mother, George not knowing anything about the past between Eugene and his mother and not hiding his animosity toward Eugene despite his feelings for Lucy. What George can see is that Fanny is hoping that Eugene will court her, as she has secretly been in love with him herself over the years. George's plan for his life with Lucy is not to get a job, but rather live off the Amberson fortune as the family's only heir, funneling some of that money into philanthropy, but largely using it to act the leading citizen as is his custom. What happens with this collective group is largely directed by the affect Eugene's invention has on society, and George's sense that nothing will change just because he says it won't.

Ygor attempts to put up some resistance but the villagers rush the gates and begin to destroy the castle.

Needing help to restore the Monster's strength, Ygor brings his hulking friend to Ludwig Frankenstein, the original doctor's son. Ludwig has built a life and a reputation for himself in another town, far from the stigma and shame that his father and brother brought on the family. Ygor blackmails him. The good Ludwig realizes that the Monster is evil and must be destroyed, but he struggles with the idea of taking a life, even an undead one. He finds a solution: replace the Monster's criminal brain with the brain of his recent victim, the noble Doctor Kettering. But sly Ygor is a step ahead: he manipulates Ludwig's colleague, the jealous Doctor Bohmer, into substituting Ygor's brain for Kettering's. After the operation, the Monster--with his physical strength now guided by Ygor's wicked brain--is more terrible than ever. When will those stuffy scientists finally learn? Luckily, there is a mob of angry villagers outside Frankenstein's house...

Feisty Loxi Claiborne is running the family salvage business following the death of her father. Shortly after a hurricane blows through the area word comes that a ship has foundered on the reefs. Loxi and her salvage master Captain Phil head out on their ship, the Claiborne, to claim salvage rights, competeing with other ships.The sinking ship is the Jubilee, and a rival salvager, Captain King Cutler, has already arrived. Cutler fires a salvo across the bow of Loxi's ship to warn her off. Suspecting a planned scuttling, Loxi agrees to save some of the crew, while denied part of the cargo salvage. Thus she meets Captain Jack Stuart, unconscious and lashed to the mast when his ship hit the rocks.Loxi lives with her widowed mother and a visiting cousin from Havana called Drusilla. Also living in the house is a colored servant who helped raise Loxi. Drusilla happens to be involved with King Cutler's brother Dan, but must be secretive about it.Bringing him home to recuperate, Loxi and Jack eventually fall in love. He tells her that his dream is to command a new steam ship, the Southern Cross. But Jack feels that an important man within the Deveraux company, which owns the ship, has it out for him, and will use the sinking of the Jubilee to deny him the Southern Cross. Jack plans to go to Charleston to plead his case; as it happens Loxi also plans a trip to Charleston with Drusilla to visit her aunt.Loxi meets Steve Tolliver at a party in Charleston. Steve is the important man that Jack referred to. Finding that she is unable to talk to a very ill Commodore Deveraux, head of the shipping line, Loxi decides to ""wrap that Steve Tolliver around my little finger,"" in order to secure command of the Southern Cross for Jack. Loxi flirts outrageously with Steve and at a dance everyone there assumes they are a couple. When she realizes this, Loxi stops the music and announces her real love is Jack, and that she intends to marry him. Later that night they plan to wed on board Jack's ship before he sails back to the Caribbean. But Steve interrupts the ceremony in time, throwing Loxi into the bay and jumping in after her, then ordering the ship to sail.Leaving Charleston, Drusilla returns home to Havana and Loxi and Steve return to Key West. Steve has come to rid the Keys of pirates like Cutler. Cutler in turn arranges to have Steve shanghaied by the crew of the whaler Tyfib. Loxi hears of the plot and gets Jack to help her save Steve. Later they discover that Steve has Jack's appointment to the Southern Cross with him. Angry over a seemingly underhanded act, Jack meets with Cutler before sailing to Havana to take command of his new ship.Rumors circulate and prices of the cargo of the Southern Cross go up and down wildly, leaving Steve to suspect a wreck is planned. He commandeers the Claiborne with Loxi on board and heads to Havana to stop Jack. Using an axe to part some lines, Loxi disables her ship and they sit becalmed in a fog bank as the Southern Cross piles into a reef and sinks. Unknown to Jack, Drusilla had stowed away to return to Dan Cutler and she is drowned.Jack is put on trial for wrecking his ship and the testimony reveals a woman may have been on board, though none was rescued. To determine if a woman's body is in the wreck, Steve agrees to dive with Jack to the wreck, which sits on a shelf just below the surface, but on the edge of a deep trench. On the dive ship Captain Cutler instructs one of his men to sever Steve's air hose, but Captain Phil intervenes in time.While down in the wreck Jack and Steve discover proof that Drusilla was on board and has been drowned -- her distinctively colored shawl is seen swaying in the undersea current in the hold of the Southern Cross.Taking proof back with them that could hang Jack, they are attacked by a giant squid.

She thinks that she is working for the US Government, but fails to see why she would be involved. The enemy agents got the plan from a pulp novel written by Kibble, who is also on the ship and falls for her. But then she overhears his new novel and believes that he is talking about her. So when they leave the boat, she ignores him, but somehow, the bags get switched and he gets the magnetic mine - which she must later retrieve. It is mainly a Tommy Dorsey showcase with Sinatra singing - Powell dancing - and a small plot.

                    Andoheb (George Zucco), by day a professor at the Cairo Museum and a high priest of Karnak by night, travels to America to wreak revenge on an archaeologist, Steve Banning (Dick Foran) who, thirty years earlier, on an expedition to find the sarcophagus of the ancient Egyptian Princess Ananka, instead unearthed Ananka's lover, Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.), buried alive for sacrilege but kept from death for over 3000 years by tanna leaves administered over the centuries by the successive High Priests of Karnak. While the now-middle-aged Banning is telling his family of the trials and tribulations of dealing with Andoheb and Kharis in Egypt, the unexpected Andoheb, with Kharis in tow, looms ever closer. This does not bode well for the Banning family.

However, the bookseller is really Holmes (Basil Rathbone), who sends the Nazis after decoys while he and Tobel drive to a rendezvous with an RAF plane that takes them to London. They go to 221B Baker Street, where Watson (Nigel Bruce) pulls a gun on them, but Mrs. Hudson (Mary Gordon) recognizes Holmes's voice. Holmes leaves to make arrangements with government representative Sir Reginald Bailey (Holmes Herbert), and Tobel sneaks out while Watson is asleep. He goes to see his sweetheart, Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), and gives her a message which, if anything happens to him, she's to give to Holmes. The message is in a version of the stick-figure code from the Holmes story ""The Adventure of the Dancing Men"". On his way back from Charlotte's, Tobel is struck on the head, but a policeman rescues him. Back at 221B, Holmes deduces that Tobel has been with a girl, and even describes her based on clues left on Tobel's clothing.The next day, a test of Tobel's bomb sight is a huge success. Tobel will supply it to the RAF, but insists that he will arrange all production, so no one besides himself will know the secret of the invention. The authorities reluctantly agree not to interfere, and will rely on Holmes to protect Tobel unofficially. Tobel brings a gift-wrapped package to fellow scientist Prof. Frederic Hoffner (Henry Victor). It's the prototype of the part of the bomb sight he'll be producing. Three other scientists will produce the other parts, all unknown to anyone other than Tobel. Soon, Scotland Yard reports that Tobel is missing. Holmes tracks down his secret office, but all they find there is some gift wrapping and the scent of an expensive perfume. Holmes deduces that Tobel called his lady love from 221B that first night and has the call traced. When Holmes visits her, Charlotte hands him the envelope Tobel left, but now it only contains a note - ""We meet again, Mr. Holmes."" It must have been switched by the ""electrician"" who came to Charlotte's apartment. From her description, Holmes realizes that he's up against Prof. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill).Holmes disguises himself as a thug formerly in Moriarty's employ and roams Soho until an old sailor leads him to one of Moriarty's places of business. The master criminal won't back down from his plans of treason, and has Holmes put in the false bottom of a sea chest, so he can be dumped in the ocean. Meanwhile a ""beggar"" (Michael Mark) who followed Holmes to Moriarty's place reports back to Watson and Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey). They see Moriarty's two henchmen carrying away the sea chest. Amazingly, Lestrade figures out the false bottom trick and rescues Holmes. Back at Charlotte's, he takes the sheet of paper that was underneath the one on which Tobel wrote his coded message and finds away to reveal the message from it. Watson recognizes the substitution cypher from the earlier case, but it takes Holmes to figure out the variation that Tobel used. Decoded, the message gives the names and addresses of 3 of the 4 scientists (which is enough for Holmes to deduce Tobel's entire scheme). The final name is gibberish - obviously coded differently. Moriarty has had the message longer, and has already murdered the first three scientists and taken the prototypes of their components. The final name has him stumped - as he's busy trying unsuccessfully to torture it out of Tobel. Holmes realizes that the final name and address, of Prof. Hoffner, were coded in mirror image. Not long after, Moriarty comes to the same realization, and sends men to grab Hoffner (who will be more useful alive than the others) and the final component.When the thugs return, Moriarty opens the package, only to find a note - ""We meet again, Professor."" Of course, the captured scientist is really Holmes in disguise. Unknown to Moriarty and his men, while they were grabbing the fake professor, the real one went to their car and attached a device that would drip luminous paint on the street. Although they are delayed by a false trail at one point, Watson and the police are able to track Holmes to Moriarty's supposedly impregnable hideout. Meanwhile, Moriarty is open about his intention to murder Holmes, but the latter mocks his lack of originality in means of death. If their positions were reversed, he says, he'd put a needle in Moriarty and start slowly removing his blood, so Moriarty would die by inches, fully conscious the entire time. ""The needle to the last, eh Holmes?"" says Moriarty, but of course he can't resist inflicting this very form of death on the detective. This elaborate process gives Lestrade and Watson time to arrive and rescue Holmes. Nearby, a gunfight breaks out when police attempt to rescue Tobel, and Moriarty escapes in the confusion. Holmes, though weakened, has anticipated Moriarty and has a gun on him.

                    Working for the British government, Sherlock Holmes manages to spirit Dr. Franz Tobel out of Switzerland and into England before the GESTAPO are able to get to him. Tobel has devised an immensely accurate bomb site and while he is willing to make it available to the Allies, he insists on manufacturing it himself. Soon however, he vanishes and it is left to Homes, assisted by the bumbling Dr. Watson, to decipher a coded message he left behind.

"29","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035429/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Just before a German Invasion of England during World War 2, a group of German Paratroopers are sent to a small English village to set up a signaling device to aid in this invasion.They are disguised as British soldiers and for the most part their disguise works, but begins to unwind as one of the villagers discovers a Viennese Chocolate bar with chocolate spelled in German. This, coupled with the accidental discovery of a piece of paper used by these false troops used to score a card game as they wait to fulfill their missions causes further suspicions as the scoring contains certain indications of Continental script (the number seven written with a line through it) leads to serious suspicions regarding the nature of these ""British"" troops.The chief liaison with the undercover German Troops in this quiet English Village is a well respected member of the community and the people turn to this traitor to outline their suspicions. He then takes them directly to the head of German invaders who immediately opts for plan B, namely forcefully taking over the English village.They move the townspeople into various locations to control their movements and the remaining story becomes how the townspeople can alert the proper authorities to their current circumstance.

    Synopsis
    Just before a German Invasion of England during World War 2, a group of German Paratroopers are sent to a small English village to set up a signaling device to aid in this invasion.They are disguised as British soldiers and for the most part their disguise works, but begins to unwind as one of the villagers discovers a Viennese Chocolate bar with chocolate spelled in German. This, coupled with the accidental discovery of a piece of paper used by these false troops used to score a card game as they wait to fulfill their missions causes further suspicions as the scoring contains certain indications of Continental script (the number seven written with a line through it) leads to serious suspicions regarding the nature of these ""British"" troops.The chief liaison with the undercover German Troops in this quiet English Village is a well respected member of the community and the people turn to this traitor to outline their suspicions. He then takes them directly to the head of German invaders who immediately opts for plan B, namely forcefully taking over the English village.They move the townspeople into various locations to control their movements and the remaining story becomes how the townspeople can alert the proper authorities to their current circumstance. As the Germans want to keep as low key as possible, they want to preserve a business as usual atmosphere during the following day so that they may complete their mission without resistance.The villagers stage various attempts to get the word out, one being writing a message on an hen's egg that is given to the paper boy (he being from another town).

Parris Mitchell was orphaned at an early age and lives with his grandmother. His best friend is Drake McHugh, who is also orphaned and lives with his aunt. His other best friend is Cassandra Tower. Cassie's father is a doctor but does not practice his profession. Her mother is rarely seen and spends all her time in an upstairs bedroom. After school one day, Cassie and Parris go swimming in the pond, stripping to their underwear. But Cassie says they shouldn't do it again as her strict father would take a switch to her.Parris agrees to come to Cassie's birthday party, only Louise Gordon, daughter of the town doctor, is having her own party the same day. Only a few children show up at Cassie's party. She is in tears and Parris tries to comfort her. But she asks him to leave. He sees Mrs. Tower looking out her window and tries to talk to her. But Dr. Tower intercepts him and says Mrs. Tower is too ill to see anyone. Parris politely thanks him for the party and shakes hands. Not long after, Cassie reveals that her father is taking her out of school. Parris doesn't understand why and neither does Cassie, who says her father is going to teach her himself.Parris and Drake see a younger boy sitting on the front steps of his home, crying loudly. When they ask what's wrong, the boy says that Dr. Gordon is going to operate on his father, who has ulcers on his legs. Just then the children hear a terrible scream coming from the house. Because his father has heart disease, according to Dr. Gordon, anesthesia cannot be used. Parris and Drake run away when they hear another scream.Years pass and Parris is home from college. While taking a walk in the countryside, he runs into Drake driving a buggy. His passengers are the Ross sisters, Jinny and Poppy. They have bad reputations and Parris turns down an offer from Drake to join them. He is going to see Dr. Tower, who is now a widower. Before he can study medicine in Vienna, as his grandmother wishes, he must pass the entrance examinations. Dr. Tower has agreed to tutor him. When he arrives at the Tower place, Cassie lets him in. She seems almost frightened and points him to her father's study. Dr. Tower is barely cordial and instructs Parris to use the outside door in the study to come and go so he won't have to go through the house. Parris wants to ask about Cassie and why her father won't let her go anywhere. But he loses his nerve.Parris comes to know Dr. Tower and finds him to be intelligent and wise. The tutoring is hard and Parris spends many nights studying. Drake continues to see the Ross girls but confides that he is really in love with Louise Gordon. But her parents disapprove because he is a playboy. His aunt has died and left him a trust fund but he has too much time on his hands. Drake decides to confront Louise's parents and insists that Parris come along. Louise loves Drake but is reluctant to marry him partly because of the Ross girls and partly because he isn't wealthy. After a nasty scene with her parents, Drake storms out.Unknown to Parris, his grandmother is suffering from cancer. However, he knows she is ill. Dr. Gordon has a bad reputation for performing unnecessary surgery. Parris consults the town attorney, Colonel Skeffington, to ask if there is any truth to the rumors about Dr. Gordon. If so, he doesn't want him treating his grandmother. The Colonel assures Parris that as far as his grandmother is concerned, Dr. Gordon is acting in a correct manner.Parris sees Cassie several times and knows how unhappy she is, but she won't tell him why her father literally keeps her under lock and key. Then one night he stops by and Cassie is alone. Her father is on a business trip and won't be back for several days. It is hinted that the two had sex that night. Later on, Parris stops by Drake's house and his friend guesses what has happened.Parris learns the truth about his grandmother and that she won't live much longer. After her death, he goes to stay with Drake until it is time to leave for Vienna. Then Cassie comes by, wild and incoherent. She begs Parris to take her with him to Vienna, that she can't stay at home any longer. Parris agrees but then once again, Louise runs off. Drake and Parris go to the Tower home but nothing seems amiss. Dr. Tower is sitting on the front porch and Cassie comes to the door, at which point he goes inside.The next morning, Parris learns that Cassie and her father are both dead. He poisoned her and shot himself. Parris believes it is his fault because Dr. Tower must have found out about him and Cassie. Drake goes to the Tower home to see what he can find out but insists that Parris stay behind. The sheriff and other officials are going through Dr. Tower's papers. On learning that Cassie's bags were packed, indicating that she planned to leave home, Drake says he was the one Cassie was going to run away with. He wants to keep Parris's name out of it.To Parris's shock, Dr. Tower left him his estate. He doesn't understand why until he finds a notebook left for him by the doctor. Cassie's mother was insane and had been for years before her death. Now Dr. Tower was noticing those same traits in Cassie. He decided it was better to kill his daughter before she could marry Parris and make him as miserable as Mrs. Tower had made him. Apparently he had known of the secret meetings between Parris and Cassie.When Parris leaves on the train, Drake sees him off and runs into Randy Monaghan, a childhood friend from the wrong side of the tracks. She was wild as a girl but has grown into a beautiful, respectable woman. She lives in a house by the railroad tracks with her father and brother, who both work for the railroad. Drake is attracted to her and they start going on buggy rides together. But she warns him that she won't marry him because they are from different social classes.While Parris is in Vienna, Drake learns that a bank official has absconded with his trust fund money, as well as money belonging to others. Suddenly penniless, Drake sells his aunt's house and gets a job with the railway company. Randy's father helps him get it. Then, on a dark and rainy night, Drake has an accident at work and injures his legs. Dr. Gordon is called from a party to attend him. Louise is hysterical and wants to go with him for she still loves Drake. But her parents won't permit it. At the shack where Drake was carried, Dr. Gordon says his legs are so badly injured that they must be amputated. No one questions his decision, but when he arrives home, Louise is waiting. She heard what happened and accuses her father of malpractice, not only on Drake but many others. As her hysteria grows, she declares that she is going to tell everyone about what he has done. Her father threatens to have her committed to the insane asylum. Knowing he can do it, she promises to keep silent.Drake is taken to the Monaghan house to recuperate and is unconscious for several days. Randy's father and brother Todd know she wants to keep him there and they agree. A special delivery letter is sent to Parris in Vienna. When Drake finally wakes up, he screams out ""Where is the rest of me?""Parris has done so well in Vienna that he is offered a position in the hospital there. He intends to accept it until he gets Randy's letter. Knowing that his friend needs him now, he leaves for Kings' Row. Drake and Randy are married by the time he returns home and Drake is resigned to spending the rest of his life in bed. But Parris has no intention of letting that happen. He gives Drake and Randy his inheritance from Dr. Tower so they will have an easier time and begins to encourage Drake to take an interest in life again. Once Drake is on the road to recovery, Parris intends to return to Vienna.On learning that Dr. Gordon recently died, Parris decides to stay in Kings Row so its citizens won't be without a doctor. To his surprise, Mrs. Gordon sends for him. Since Drake's accident, Louise has spent most of her time in bed. She refused to attend her father's funeral. Mrs. Gordon reveals that on the night her husband died, she found Louise standing over his body cursing him. She believes the girl is insane and wants Parris to treat her. Parris talks to Louise in her bedroom and learns a shocking fact. Louise believes Drake's amputation was totally unnecessary, as well as many other operations he performed which left the patients maimed. She wants Parris to help her tell the townspeople. He tries to dissuade her, pointing out that even if it is true her father cannot be brought to justice. She is so insistent that he agrees. Over time he tries to interest her in books and art, but she is set on avenging Drake.Randy has an idea that she and Drake should use their money to buy property and build low-cost homes for working people. Parris encourages this and tells them they should build a home for themselves. But Drake suddenly hates the whole idea and makes Randy promise that he will never have to leave his bedroom. Later, Parris tells Randy that these outbursts are to be expected and in time will go away. Randy says that her brother bought Drake a wheelchair but he wouldn't use it.While taking a walk near his old home, Parris meets Elise Sandor. She and her father bought the house two years earlier. He is instantly taken with Elise and goes home with her. He meets her father and stays for dinner, after which he and Elise play the piano. Now that he has met Elise, Parris feels better about staying in Kings Row.A hysterical Louise comes to the Monaghan home demanding to see Drake. Parris happens to be there and she lashes out, accusing him of not doing anything to help her cause of going public about her father. Randy is horrified to learn the truth and Parris tells her never to say anything to Drake. He believes if his friend knows, he will give up altogether. After Louise leaves, Randy's brother reveals that he knew one of the men who had assisted Dr. Gordon with Drake's surgery. That man said there were no injuries that he could find to Drake's legs.Parris now wants to silence Louise as he is afraid Drake will learn the truth. He decides to have her committed to an insane asylum and writes the necessary letter. But before mailing it, he discusses the situation with Elise. She wants him to leave Louise alone and let her say what she will. She also thinks he is too close to Drake to be his doctor and maybe what he wants for Drake is not the right thing. Parris asks if she will go back to Vienna with him and she agrees but it is obvious she is not happy about it. Suddenly he gets up and leaves, promising to return if what he has in mind works out. Bursting into Drake's bedroom, he tells him the truth; that Dr. Gordon amputated his legs unnecessarily, out of revenge for his interest in Louise. To his utter shock, Drake bursts out laughing. He and Randy embrace and he agrees to move into a new house. Parris returns to Elise's house, where she comes running across the lawn to meet him. They embrace.","

Dr. Gordon has a bad reputation for performing unnecessary surgery. Parris consults the town attorney, Colonel Skeffington, to ask if there is any truth to the rumors about Dr. Gordon. If so, he doesn't want him treating his grandmother. The Colonel assures Parris that as far as his grandmother is concerned, Dr. Gordon is acting in a correct manner.Parris sees Cassie several times and knows how unhappy she is, but she won't tell him why her father literally keeps her under lock and key. Then one night he stops by and Cassie is alone. Her father is on a business trip and won't be back for several days. It is hinted that the two had sex that night. Later on, Parris stops by Drake's house and his friend guesses what has happened.Parris learns the truth about his grandmother and that she won't live much longer. After her death, he goes to stay with Drake until it is time to leave for Vienna. Then Cassie comes by, wild and incoherent. She begs Parris to take her with him to Vienna, that she can't stay at home any longer. Parris agrees but then once again, Louise runs off. Drake and Parris go to the Tower home but nothing seems amiss. Dr. Tower is sitting on the front porch and Cassie comes to the door, at which point he goes inside.The next morning, Parris learns that Cassie and her father are both dead. He poisoned her and shot himself. Parris believes it is his fault because Dr. Tower must have found out about him and Cassie. Drake goes to the Tower home to see what he can find out but insists that Parris stay behind. The sheriff and other officials are going through Dr. Tower's papers. On learning that Cassie's bags were packed, indicating that she planned to leave home, Drake says he was the one Cassie was going to run away with. He wants to keep Parris's name out of it.To Parris's shock, Dr. Tower left him his estate. He doesn't understand why until he finds a notebook left for him by the doctor. Cassie's mother was insane and had been for years before her death. Now Dr. Tower was noticing those same traits in Cassie. He decided it was better to kill his daughter before she could marry Parris and make him as miserable as Mrs. Tower had made him. Apparently he had known of the secret meetings between Parris and Cassie.When Parris leaves on the train, Drake sees him off and runs into Randy Monaghan, a childhood friend from the wrong side of the tracks. She was wild as a girl but has grown into a beautiful, respectable woman. She lives in a house by the railroad tracks with her father and brother, who both work for the railroad. Drake is attracted to her and they start going on buggy rides together. But she warns him that she won't marry him because they are from different social classes.While Parris is in Vienna, Drake learns that a bank official has absconded with his trust fund money, as well as money belonging to others. Suddenly penniless, Drake sells his aunt's house and gets a job with the railway company. Randy's father helps him get it. Then, on a dark and rainy night, Drake has an accident at work and injures his legs. Dr. Gordon is called from a party to attend him. Louise is hysterical and wants to go with him for she still loves Drake. But her parents won't permit it. At the shack where Drake was carried, Dr. Gordon says his legs are so badly injured that they must be amputated. No one questions his decision, but when he arrives home, Louise is waiting. She heard what happened and accuses her father of malpractice, not only on Drake but many others. As her hysteria grows, she declares that she is going to tell everyone about what he has done. Her father threatens to have her committed to the insane asylum. Knowing he can do it, she promises to keep silent.Drake is taken to the Monaghan house to recuperate and is unconscious for several days. Randy's father and brother Todd know she wants to keep him there and they agree. A special delivery letter is sent to Parris in Vienna. When Drake finally wakes up, he screams out ""Where is the rest of me?""Parris has done so well in Vienna that he is offered a position in the hospital there. He intends to accept it until he gets Randy's letter. Knowing that his friend needs him now, he leaves for Kings' Row. Drake and Randy are married by the time he returns home and Drake is resigned to spending the rest of his life in bed. But Parris has no intention of letting that happen. He gives Drake and Randy his inheritance from Dr. Tower so they will have an easier time and begins to encourage Drake to take an interest in life again. Once Drake is on the road to recovery, Parris intends to return to Vienna.On learning that Dr. Gordon recently died, Parris decides to stay in Kings Row so its citizens won't be without a doctor. To his surprise, Mrs. Gordon sends for him. Since Drake's accident, Louise has spent most of her time in bed. She refused to attend her father's funeral. Mrs. Gordon reveals that on the night her husband died, she found Louise standing over his body cursing him. She believes the girl is insane and wants Parris to treat her. Parris talks to Louise in her bedroom and learns a shocking fact. Louise believes Drake's amputation was totally unnecessary, as well as many other operations he performed which left the patients maimed. She wants Parris to help her tell the townspeople. He tries to dissuade her, pointing out that even if it is true her father cannot be brought to justice. She is so insistent that he agrees. Over time he tries to interest her in books and art, but she is set on avenging Drake.Randy has an idea that she and Drake should use their money to buy property and build low-cost homes for working people. Parris encourages this and tells them they should build a home for themselves. But Drake suddenly hates the whole idea and makes Randy promise that he will never have to leave his bedroom. Later, Parris tells Randy that these outbursts are to be expected and in time will go away. Randy says that her brother bought Drake a wheelchair but he wouldn't use it.While taking a walk near his old home, Parris meets Elise Sandor. She and her father bought the house two years earlier. He is instantly taken with Elise and goes home with her. He meets her father and stays for dinner, after which he and Elise play the piano. Now that he has met Elise, Parris feels better about staying in Kings Row.A hysterical Louise comes to the Monaghan home demanding to see Drake. Parris happens to be there and she lashes out, accusing him of not doing anything to help her cause of going public about her father. Randy is horrified to learn the truth and Parris tells her never to say anything to Drake. He believes if his friend knows, he will give up altogether. After Louise leaves, Randy's brother reveals that he knew one of the men who had assisted Dr. Gordon with Drake's surgery. That man said there were no injuries that he could find to Drake's legs.Parris now wants to silence Louise as he is afraid Drake will learn the truth. He decides to have her committed to an insane asylum and writes the necessary letter. But before mailing it, he discusses the situation with Elise. She wants him to leave Louise alone and let her say what she will. She also thinks he is too close to Drake to be his doctor and maybe what he wants for Drake is not the right thing. Parris asks if she will go back to Vienna with him and she agrees but it is obvious she is not happy about it. Suddenly he gets up and leaves, promising to return if what he has in mind works out. Bursting into Drake's bedroom, he tells him the truth; that Dr. Gordon amputated his legs unnecessarily, out of revenge for his interest in Louise. To his utter shock, Drake bursts out laughing. He and Randy embrace and he agrees to move into a new house. Parris returns to Elise's house, where she comes running across the lawn to meet him. They embrace.

                    Frank Raymond, grandson of the original Invisible Man, still has the old formula but considers it too dangerous to use, even when Axis agents try to get it. But Pearl Harbor brings him to volunteer his own services as an invisible agent in Germany. Though a bit cold (clothes aren't invisible), his adventures are more comedy than thriller (with occasional grim reminders) as he makes fools of Nazi officials and romances a luscious double agent, in search of Hitler's secret plan...

                    Frank Raymond changed his name and took up a life as the owner of a printing shop in order to distance himself from his former identity: as the grandson of the man who invented the formula for invisibility but ended up shot down by the police. Unfortunately, it's wartime and the formula is coveted by both the Allies and the Axis. Axis spies discover Frank's true identity and force him to leave the shop. Frank believes the formula is too dangerous for any government to possess. But after Pearl Harbor, he agrees to give it to Washington D.C. on one condition: that he be allowed to become an invisible spy. Soon, Frank is behind enemy lines, romancing a beautiful double agent and playing pranks on Nazi officials. But his work is deadly serious. He soon learns of Hitler's secret plan against the United States.

                    When a Nazi saboteur jeeringly predicts to the nation new depredations, via their radio 'Voice of Terror', the Intellegence Inner Council summons Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) to help in the crisis.

                    Brief stories tied together by an unlucky tail coat, interesting as a chance to see some great stars in their prime. The first story is a romantic triangle with Charles Boyer, Rita Hayworth, and Thomas Mitchell. The coat moves to another owner, a fanciful tale featuring Henry Fonda, Ginger Rogers, and Cesar Romero. The coat is next bought by Elsa Lanchester for her (real-life) husband, Charles Laughton, playing a down-on-his-luck musician and composer. It then comes into the possession of a disbarred lawyer, Edward G. Robinson who meets a classmate, George Sanders, at a very elegant college reunion. The coat is taken by two gangsters who lose it, and found by the very poorest of the poor, the Black community of the depression-racked 1930's, played by famed singer Paul Robeson and the great Ethel Waters, who go to their pastor, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, with whom the coat finally brings something good.

But a holiday in Germany shortly after Hitler assumes power convinces him that it is vital to design a completely new type of fighter plane and that sooner or later Britain's very survival may depend on what he comes to call the Spitfire.

Mitchell worked for Supermarine who specialized for many years on developing seaplanes. He enjoyed a good deal of success winning prestigious air races with the help of his test pilot Geoffrey Crisp. Money was always in short supply however and the government was always hesitant to invest. When Supermarine is bought out by Vickers, Mitchell has a bit more leeway. After a visit to Germany in the 1930s, he sees the Nazi threat first-hand and decides to design a fighter with a completely new engine. The result was the famed Spitfire.

                    In suburban Lochester, New England, three people end up living together in high school teacher Nora Shelley's rental house. The first is her new tenant, renowned Harvard law professor Michael Lightcap, who has rented the house for the summer while he writes his new book. The second is Nora herself. Despite having an auspicious first meeting, Lightcap hires Nora to be his live-in cook and secretary for a week until his manservant Tilney arrives. The third is Joseph, the property's gardener, who is currently laid up with a sprained ankle. In reality, Joseph is Nora's childhood friend Leopold Dilg, who has just escaped from prison. Leopold was being tried for the arson of the factory where he worked, and for murder for the death of the factory foreman Clyde Bracken, whose body was never recovered but who is assumed to have died in the fire. Despite the danger to herself, Nora hides Leopold since she believes his story that although he, as an activist, did speak out about the dangerous conditions at the factory, he did not set the fire, which he assumes was done by the factory's owner, Andrew Holmes, to collect the insurance money, all the while having Leopold as a scapegoat. Nora campaigned to get the job with Lightcap if only to be able to better hide Leopold in the house. Leopold escaped if only because he knew he would not get a fair trial due to the rabble rousing being conducted by Holmes against him. Lightcap and who he knows as Joseph end up getting along famously, although activist Leopold believes Lightcap's view of the law is too clinical for him truly to be a great lawyer or great judge, those thoughts arising if only because Nora and Leopold learn clandestinely that Lightcap is being appointed to the Supreme Court. Nora, Leopold and Leopold's lawyer, Sam Yates, try to get Lightcap involved in helping Leopold by showing him that Leopold indeed will not get a fair trial. In the process, Lightcap may in turn show Leopold and Nora that his current way of thinking has much merit.

In conversation, though, Lightcap realizes that the gardener has a lot to say about the law! Nora and Dilg team up to convince him that Dilg was framed. The three dodge the cops, try to capture the real crooks, and discover that both men have fallen for Nora. Two different endings were filmed, one in which Nora gives her heart to Dilg, the other in which she leaves with Lightcap. Guess which one remains the classic comic conclusion.

She, however, doesn't even notice him in her self-absorbed world. Even if she did notice him, Little Picks wouldn't have a chance with her as she is the kept girlfriend of powerful and crooked club owner Case Ables. It isn't until Pinks does her a favor that Gloria notices him for the first time, that favor which costs him his job working at Case's club. Pinks and Gloria's lives become more ensconced when she, in a return favor, gets him a job as a busboy in the club where she is currently performing. It is then that Pinks fondly gives her the nickname ""Your Highness"", which becomes a moniker all in their mutual circle use for her in her callous regard for everyone around her. Gloria's life changes when she decides to leave Case for a high rolling glamour boy named Decatur Reed. Case, in a fit of jealousy, is able effectively to take away her livelihood, perhaps for good. Pinks had anonymously provided small gifts to Gloria in the past, she believing they all from Decatur. But now Pinks decides to take care of Gloria in all aspects of her life, some of those actions of which she is well aware, but most which she isn't. Those that know both Pinks and Gloria believe he is a fool for his devotion to her, but they nonetheless help him help her in any way they can without any question of what they will get in return. The questions become how far poor Pinks will go to help her, and through all these acts of kindness whether Gloria will ever come to a new perspective about Pinks and those that have helped her.

Henry, momentarily attracted to Regina, realizes he is in love with Billie when he hears her sing. Billie, resists his attentions, believing him the property of Regina since it is a Van Maaster family tradition that no girls in the family can marry until the eldest has. Billie admits her love for Henry but Regina will not relent. The old man trails Regine to New York where she says she has eloped, and asks that Billie marry Henry. Six couples in wedding clothes stand at the altar in the Little Delft church; Billie and Henry and the five other sisters with their intended.

                    Dr. Lynn Harper, psychologist, has been called out to the old Ingston Mansion, a dark and mysterious place with a very bad reputation, in order to make an assessment of the sanity of Margaret Ingston, daughter of patriarch Kurt Ingston. She claims to be sane, but she is clearly very disturbed; we can't be certain, although the doctor gives her a clean bill of health. But then Dick Baldwin shows up on the scene, just when Dr. Lynne has been receiving thinly veiled threats from the inhabitants of the house. He's our hero. Three medical doctors have been invited out to the mansion as well, Dr. Timmons, Dr. Phipps and the sleazy Dr. King (Lionel Atwill). One by one the doctors are mysteriously murdered. Dick Baldwin must figure out who is doing the killings, and he must do so before whoever it is can kill his new love interest, Dr. Lynne Harper. But the only one he can trust is Kurt Ingston himself, since Ingston has no legs and can't have perpetrated these murders. Is it sinister Rolf, the butler, or Laurie, the sex crazed and sociopathic chauffeur, or Agor Singh, the Hindu Yogi with his strange ways? And of course, Lynne might be wrong, Margaret may be very insane, and she might be the culprit.

                    Among those that live in the community of Tortilla Flat - located in the hills above Monterey, California - are the paisanos, a small subset of the large Hispanic immigrant population of the area. The paisanos are idle and thus poor men who choose this life rather than work to earn a living. They happily live under the stars and live solely for the here and now, meaning good food and wine rather than any material possessions. Pilon, one their own, is largely able to manipulate the others to do what he wants to get that food and wine without him having to lift a finger and without them realizing that they are being manipulated. Things change when Danny Alvarez, one of the younger paisanos, inherits from his recently deceased grandfather an expensive pocket watch and two houses in Tortilla Flat. Pilon senses opportunities to parlay Danny's new possessions into his wants, again without having to do any work or pay any money, one of the wants now including a roof under which to sleep. One of those opportunities involves the Pirate, another poor elderly man who lives in poverty in a shack next to the woods with his many dogs. The Pirate collects and sells wood, his entire take which is 25¢ a day. As he never sees the Pirate spend any money and as 25¢ a day adds up, Pilon is certain that the Pirate has a large cache of money hidden away somewhere which could buy a lot of good food and wine. All Pilon's plans may be threatened with the arrival of Dolores Ramirez, a young ethnic Portuguese woman, into Tortilla Flat. For Danny, who nicknames her Sweets, it's love at first sight, while it is a love/hate feeling from Dolores' side, she who sees a man who is unwilling to work to live and support whoever in his life. Pilon figures that he has to nix the burgeoning love between Danny and Dolores for him to continue to get what he wants.

He tries to borrow the money honestly from the bank (although Jug and Weepy are all for breaking into the bank and stealing it) but because Maxwell has no collateral, the bank turns him down. Determined to follow the straight-and-narrow, Maxwell decides to steal the money from the bank's vaults after all.

Well, owning the store would make it much easier to tunnel under the bank's vault than having to find reasons to go into the store's basement, and Maxwell raises the the $1,000 purchase price by throwing Jug in front of a passing car for a quick on-the-street cash settlment between him and the car's driver.So now Maxwell owns a luggage store, which he has no interest in but which attracts more of a crowd than he wants. In the first place, the street is being torn up for subway construction, and the local store owners (including a ditzy lingerie shop widow!) keep dropping in to say hi and see if Maxwell can do anything about the construction company's snail-like pace, which is keeping traffic away from the street--and their stores. Then there's a pushy charmer of a salesman for the Hotchkiss Luggage Company (Jeff Randolph, played by Jack Carson) who finagles Weepy into buying a whole new spring line of luggage. Then there's Maxwell's lovely adopted daughter, Denny Costello (Jane Wyman), whom Maxwell told on his first day out of the slammer that he was going straight. She drops in when she discovers that he has bought the luggage store, not altogether convinced that he is serious about his pledge to go straight.In the meantime, Maxwell, Jug (who has eyes on Denny), and Weepy begin to dig down through the luggage store's basement floor to tunnel over to the bank's vault. Denny discovers the plan from Jug, and enlists Randolph's help in foiling Maxwell's plan--by making the luggage store so popular the three partners have no time to tunnel. The plan works--and what's more, Maxwell becomes a kind of local hero when he gives in to the pressure from the other storekeepers and talks with the construction company's owner to speed up the process. They don't know it, of course, but Maxwell knows the owner from his life of crime and although Maxwell privately assures the owner that he has nothing to worry about, to take all the time he wants in the construction, the construction owner thinks Maxwell is going to spill the beans about the project's contract (apparently illegally gotten) and hurries the construction along so fast it's done in three weeks. That's just in time for Christmas. This makes the other store owners thrilled, and they nearly canonize Maxwell for his effort.The plan by Denny and Jeff to make the luggage store incredibly popular goes over so well that Maxwell decides to close the store temporarily (for ""alterations) so that they can dig.
