                    ""You are not often afforded the privilege of viewing a real French can-can and this film is therefore bound to score a success. Mlle. Fraidora the celebrated French can-can dancer is shown in all her glory dancing her favorite dance as only she can do it. And it is not necessary to go into detail as all who have seen her pronounce her to be an artist in her line. Take this film with you to please the bald-heads. Very warm.""
