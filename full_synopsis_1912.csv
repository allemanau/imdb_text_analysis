                    When she discovers that a slave named Pharon professes his love for her, Cleopatra makes a bargain with him: she will give him ten days of ""love,"" at the end of which he is to commit suicide. He agrees, although the queen's handmaiden Iras, in love with the slave, isn't happy with the arrangement. Later when Cleopatra is seducing Marc Antony, her relationship with Pharon is used against her, but with little effect. She allies herself with Antony against Octavius, participates in a brief war, then meets her end rather than be subjected to Roman rule.

                    The Flying Circus was the largest traveling artist band in the country, and among its favorite artists were the rope-dancer, Laurento and the snake tamer, Ula Kiri. The hot blooded gypsy snake tamer is passionately in love with the attractive young man, hut he does not quite return her feelings. She is hasty and ill-tempered, and not far from being cruel to those depending on her. For the first time the Flying Circus pitches its tents in a small country town. The daughter of the mayor attends. The rope dancer meets her and for him it is a case of love at first sight, and he decides to do all in his power to win her. That night a great fire breaks out in the town, and the flying embers ignite the home of the mayor. The townspeople strive to deflect the flames, but all in vain. The mansion is doomed to destruction and it seems that the mayor's daughter must perish. At this juncture Laurento beats his way through the flames and scales the wall, and, picking up the frantic maiden, jumps to the mesh of telegraph wires outside the window. Carrying his burden over the fragile wires, he saves her amid the frantic cheers of the populace. The grateful mayor makes him a welcome guest, and he soon wins the heart of the young girl, but he has yet to obtain the father's consent. He worries continually about this problem, and not even at home can he rest in peace, for Ula Kiri, who feels that her beloved friend is sliding away from her, keeps tormenting him with jealousy and mockery. At last he plucks up his courage and goes to the mayor. The latter is friendly to the young man, but he compels the rope dancer to leave with a vague promise for the future. If circumstances, should alter. A capital idea strikes the young man to obtain money. He arranges to do a rope dance to the church tower. The circus director is delighted with the idea. The great day arrives, and the people of the town gather around the church. The rope dancer cannot forget Erna's sorrowful eyes and pale face as he walks along the flaccid rope towards the dizzy height. A snake has escaped and its body bars the way to the entrance to the tower. The snake tamer has, in her mad jealousy, forgotten all about her duties, and this negligence now proves fatal. Erna implores her in vain to call back the reptile, as she is the only one that can do it, but Ula Kiri will not listen to her in her storm of jealousy and hatred. But Erna overcomes all difficulties. Her great love teaches her what to do, and thus she saves her sweetheart. The mayor can no longer withhold his consent to the marriage and the same evening the Flying Circus goes away to the other regions, leaving a happy couple in the country town.

                    Herodias, wife of Philip of Iturea, gives her affections to her husband's brother, Herod. Their secret passion is discovered by John the Baptist. He denounces them, but, so great is his power in the land, that none dare silence him. Succumbing to the temptation of Herodias, Herod betrays his brother and casts him into the Prison of Bronze, where he is left to languish. Herodias now plots to rid herself of her husband, and she finally prevails upon a negro servant to go to the Prison of Bronze and strangle him. When Philip is dead, his brother Herod is proclaimed, 'midst great pomp, Tetrarch in his stead. For a time he rules wisely, but can never drive away the pangs of conscience that are his constant companions. Herodias next prevails upon Herod to seize and imprison John the Baptist, who is obtaining a strong hold over the people. Weakly Herod fulfills her wish, and the prophet is cast into the Prison of Bronze. St. John is beloved by Salome, the daughter of Herodias, but he spurns her affection. In vain does she visit him in the Prison of Bronze, and attempts to lure him into her power. Herod becomes possessed of an insurmountable desire to see Salome dance. This desire is discerned by the watchful Herodias and promptly frustrated. The populace begin to demand the release of John the Baptist, and fear possesses Herodias lest he should be liberated and again denounce her to the people. The visit to Herod of the Roman judges is an occasion for much feasting and merrymaking. It is at a feast given in honor of his guests that Herod requests Salome to dance. She refuses, but Herod maintains his entreaties, and finally says that he will give her anything she cares to ask for it she will dance. Salome is puzzled what to accept, but her mother creeps to her side, and, like the evil serpent, suggests that she shall ask for the head of John the Baptist. Spurned affection turns to hate of a like intensity, and Salome sees in this her chance to avenge the affront offered her by St. John. She asks tor his head. Herod regrets his rash promise, but his regrets are soon charmed away by the witchery of the dancer. When Salome has finished dancing the head is brought to her. The sight of this strikes terror to the heart of Herod, and he sees his guests shrinking from him in disgust. Too late, he seeks to repair the evil done by commanding his soldiers to seize Salome and put her to death.

"24","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141634/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Prince Otto, heir to the throne of Kronholm, and his wife. Lady Margaret, are leaving on a visit to their child Rose, who is being taken care of by an innkeeper and his wife. Prince Otto and Lady Margaret were married against the wishes of Otto's father, Prince Rupert, the reigning prince of Kronholm. The marriage of Prince Otto and Lady Margaret is not recognized by Prince Rupert, and he is not aware of the existence of the child Rose. Prince Rupert has taken steps to annul the marriage and has received word from the Pope that a decree to that effect is impending. Lady Margaret becomes aroused and determines to thwart Prince Rupert. There seems to be but one way to do this, and that is to bring about the death of the old Prince. She accordingly sends a note by messenger to her brother Albert that he must find a way to bring about Rupert's death in order to secure the title of her child. The messenger falls into the hands of Prince Rupert's soldiers who search him and find the incriminating letter. The messenger escapes wounded and reports the seizure of the letter to Lady Margaret. She at once prepares for flight to Paris, stopping at the inn to get her child whom she takes with her. Meanwhile Lady Margaret's note is delivered to Prince Rupert who reads it and sends for his son at once. Prince Otto is first shown the message from the Pope in which the marriage is pronounced illegal. Prince Otto resents his father's interference and professes undying loyalty for his wife. The pleadings of the old man not only leave Prince Otto obdurate, hut he becomes infuriated to the point of breaking his sword over his knee as a token that friendship is at an end between them. Prince Rupert, horror-struck by his son's obstinacy, finally decides to show up the unworthiness of Lady Margaret, and thus cure his son of his ill-placed love. Prince Otto in beholding the incriminating letter of his wife, begins to realize the truth. With his forebodings, he hastens to the inn and finds that his child has been taken by her mother to Paris accompanied by her man-servant. A farewell note is handed him by the innkeeper. Arriving in Paris, Lady Margaret makes arrangements for the care of little Rose with a poor family in the suburbs, and then leaves the country. The scene changes to the slums of Paris showing the Black Cat Inn, which is a resort for vicious and lawless characters. The dominating personage of the unsavory characters who loiter here, is an old thief who is known as the ""Wolf."" His wife, a repulsive old creature, is known as the ""Buzzard,"" and his son, a crafty sneak, is known as the ""Hopper."" Between them they have all the others very well cowed. There comes to the Black Cat Inn one day a countryman known as Fritz. While he is enjoying himself, he is robbed by the ""Wolf,"" and Fritz makes a futile search for his pocketbook. The money stolen from him was not his own, and he writes a note to his sister begging the loan of 200 Francs. Fritz keeps .on drinking in the evil company of ""Wolf"" and ""Buzzard"" who point out to him the foolishness of his borrowing money when it is just as easy to steal it. All three proceed to rob the sister of Fritz. It happens that the sister of Fritz is the very woman with whom little Rose has been placed by Lady Margaret. The robbers appear to do their dirty work. They ransack the place and set it on fire. The old ""Wolf"" is on the point of strangling little Rose when his wife, the ""Buzzard,"" realizing that the child will be useful for begging purposes, puts a stop to it. The house is burned to the ground and Rose is carried away. Meanwhile Prince Otto has been searching Paris for his wife and child. Twelve years pass away and we next see Rose a young woman, selling flowers. She is clad in rags and has become a creature of the slums. She is known as ""La Belle Rose."" She is constantly ill-treated by the ""Wolf"" and the ""Buzzard,"" as well as by their son, the ""Hopper,"" but she shows no resentment of their treatment, except upon one occasion when she tries to take away from the ""Buzzard"" a necklace that was dear to her as a child. About this time Lady Margaret returns to ask her husband's forgiveness. Prince Otto reads her a report from the police, intimating that Rose perished in the fire twelve years ago that destroyed the inn in which she was kept. Meanwhile Fritz, the countryman, has gone from bad to worse; he is drinking heavily and associates with the characters at the Black Cat Inn. He is there when Prince Otto, still searching for Rose, enters the place in disguise. Just as the Prince enters, Fritz is engaged in forcing his unwelcome attentions upon Rose, who is trying to sell flowers. Observing this annoyance, the Prince interferes for the girl, and has a terrific fight with her insulter. The Prince gives Fritz a sound thrashing, and compels him to beg the girl's pardon. To show then that he is a good fellow, the Prince buys Fritz a drink. He learns from Fritz that Rose belongs to the old ""Wolf."" and on hearing the story of her ill-treatment at his hands, he makes a bargain with the ""Wolf"" and buys Rose from him. In the goodness of his heart, he tells Fritz to come along with them and he will give him work. With his usual cunning, the old ""Wolf"" sends his son to follow the Prince and his companions. The ""Hopper"" follows them and finds out that the stranger is a man of wealth and position. Prince Otto at once hands Fritz a letter to the police asking him to trace the antecedents of ""La Belle Rose."" Fritz does not get very far before the letter is stolen from him by the ""Hopper."" Lady Margaret and her brother Albert again become active in the case. They first locate Prince Otto, and Albert follows him to a farm where he is taking Rose to place her in good care, Albert decides that the girl is someone with whom Otto has fallen in love, and he writes his sister Margaret to that effect. This has the effect of arousing an intense animosity for the girl in the heart of Lady Margaret. The old ""Wolf"" has laid a trap for Prince Otto. He sends the ""Hopper"" with a note that he can get information of the parents of La Belle Rose if he will come to the Sewergate Inn, located in the suburbs. Otto finds the place and is thoroughly on his guard against this family of cutthroats. With two pistols he confines their attention strictly to the business in hand, but he is no match for their cunning. Directly behind Prince Otto, the ""Hopper"" opens a trap-door in the floor, and with a slight push, sends Otto tumbling headlong to the sewer beneath. The evil three descend quickly and rob the senseless man. This done, they throw open the duct from the reservoir, and the sewer begins to fill with water. Prince Otto is in immediate danger of drowning. However, his faithful servants at home have missed him. They find the letter directing him to the Sewergate Inn, and Fritz, suspecting danger, hastens there at once, arriving in the nick of time to save the life of the Prince. Lady Margaret's brother Albert runs across the ""Hopper"" and through him becomes acquainted with the old ""Wolf"" and the ""Buzzard."" He engages them to get rid of La Belle Rose, and all four return to the farm to carry out their design. They secure first a boat with a panel bottom made for sinking purposes by the pulling of a string. They next send a decoy note to Rose that she is wanted across the river to attend a friend in sickness. The girl innocently goes to the shore and starts across in the treacherous boat. When she is in mid-stream, the old ""Wolf"" pulls the string that operates the sliding panel, and in the next moment Rose is struggling for her life in the water. Prince Otto and Fritz, having called at the farm and suspecting foul play, follow the girl, and arrive at the river bank just as Rose is about to drown. Both plunge into the water and pull her to safety, while Albert and his evil companions are snarling in rage at their defeat. The rescuers take Alice to the farm, where all are happy at the outcome. Just then a state messenger arrives and informs Prince Otto of the death of his father, and salutes him as the reigning Prince. In this way Rose, for the first time learns the true rank of her benefactor. Some days later, the ""Wolf"" decides to rob the Prince and sneaks into the mansion. The intruder is promptly discovered and made a prisoner by Prince Otto and his servants. Brought before the Prince, the ""Wolf"" is charged with his many crimes. Considering the enormity of the man's evil acts, the Prince decides to put an end to his malicious activities by depriving him of his eyesight. This is done at the command of Prince Otto, and the miserable miscreant is then set out into the world to get along as best he can without his sight. While the old ""Wolf"" is being disposed of by the Prince, the ""Buzzard"" and the ""Hopper"" have gone to Lady Margaret to tell her that Rose has been killed, and to get the reward for this misdeed. Lady Margaret, trying to find some money, produces her bag of jewelry, and they promptly assault her, leaving her lying helpless while they make away with the valuables. The ""Buzzard"" and the ""Hopper' return to the Sewergate Inn. The old ""Wolf,"" his eyesight gone forever, is led by Fritz to his familiar haunt, the Sewergate Inn, where he gropes his way into the presence of the ""Buzzard"" and the ""Hopper."" When they discover that his eyesight is destroyed, they promptly rob him of everything be has and tumble him through the trap-door into the sewer. They follow him there and tie him like a dog. In the struggle, the old ""Wolf"" gets a grip on his wife's throat and strangles her. This pleases the ""Hopper"" immensely. He robs his mother of Lady Margaret's valuables and then turns in the water from the reservoir and drowns his wretched parents. The ""Hopper"" is immediately afterwards arrested and Lady Margaret's jewels are found upon him and other jewelry possessed by the ""Buzzard,"" including the locket that Rose had worn when a child. Rose is brought into the presence of Prince Otto, who has received a letter from Lady Margaret, who has been severely wounded and is dying. The Prince takes Rose with him to the bedside of the dying woman. While they are there the ""Hopper"" is brought in by the police. Among the jewels found on the ""Hopper,"" Prince Otto recognizes Rose's necklace. Rose also recognizes it at the same moment and by this means her identity is established as the daughter of Prince Otto and Lady Margaret, who very soon expires in her daughter's arms.The Moving Picture World, June 21, 1913","

    Synopsis
    Prince Otto, heir to the throne of Kronholm, and his wife. Lady Margaret, are leaving on a visit to their child Rose, who is being taken care of by an innkeeper and his wife. Prince Otto and Lady Margaret were married against the wishes of Otto's father, Prince Rupert, the reigning prince of Kronholm. The marriage of Prince Otto and Lady Margaret is not recognized by Prince Rupert, and he is not aware of the existence of the child Rose. Prince Rupert has taken steps to annul the marriage and has received word from the Pope that a decree to that effect is impending. Lady Margaret becomes aroused and determines to thwart Prince Rupert. There seems to be but one way to do this, and that is to bring about the death of the old Prince. She accordingly sends a note by messenger to her brother Albert that he must find a way to bring about Rupert's death in order to secure the title of her child. The messenger falls into the hands of Prince Rupert's soldiers who search him and find the incriminating letter. The messenger escapes wounded and reports the seizure of the letter to Lady Margaret. She at once prepares for flight to Paris, stopping at the inn to get her child whom she takes with her. Meanwhile Lady Margaret's note is delivered to Prince Rupert who reads it and sends for his son at once. Prince Otto is first shown the message from the Pope in which the marriage is pronounced illegal. Prince Otto resents his father's interference and professes undying loyalty for his wife. The pleadings of the old man not only leave Prince Otto obdurate, hut he becomes infuriated to the point of breaking his sword over his knee as a token that friendship is at an end between them. Prince Rupert, horror-struck by his son's obstinacy, finally decides to show up the unworthiness of Lady Margaret, and thus cure his son of his ill-placed love. Prince Otto in beholding the incriminating letter of his wife, begins to realize the truth. With his forebodings, he hastens to the inn and finds that his child has been taken by her mother to Paris accompanied by her man-servant. A farewell note is handed him by the innkeeper. Arriving in Paris, Lady Margaret makes arrangements for the care of little Rose with a poor family in the suburbs, and then leaves the country. The scene changes to the slums of Paris showing the Black Cat Inn, which is a resort for vicious and lawless characters. The dominating personage of the unsavory characters who loiter here, is an old thief who is known as the ""Wolf."" His wife, a repulsive old creature, is known as the ""Buzzard,"" and his son, a crafty sneak, is known as the ""Hopper."" Between them they have all the others very well cowed. There comes to the Black Cat Inn one day a countryman known as Fritz. While he is enjoying himself, he is robbed by the ""Wolf,"" and Fritz makes a futile search for his pocketbook. The money stolen from him was not his own, and he writes a note to his sister begging the loan of 200 Francs. Fritz keeps .on drinking in the evil company of ""Wolf"" and ""Buzzard"" who point out to him the foolishness of his borrowing money when it is just as easy to steal it. All three proceed to rob the sister of Fritz. It happens that the sister of Fritz is the very woman with whom little Rose has been placed by Lady Margaret. The robbers appear to do their dirty work. They ransack the place and set it on fire. The old ""Wolf"" is on the point of strangling little Rose when his wife, the ""Buzzard,"" realizing that the child will be useful for begging purposes, puts a stop to it. The house is burned to the ground and Rose is carried away. Meanwhile Prince Otto has been searching Paris for his wife and child. Twelve years pass away and we next see Rose a young woman, selling flowers. She is clad in rags and has become a creature of the slums. She is known as ""La Belle Rose."" She is constantly ill-treated by the ""Wolf"" and the ""Buzzard,"" as well as by their son, the ""Hopper,"" but she shows no resentment of their treatment, except upon one occasion when she tries to take away from the ""Buzzard"" a necklace that was dear to her as a child. About this time Lady Margaret returns to ask her husband's forgiveness. Prince Otto reads her a report from the police, intimating that Rose perished in the fire twelve years ago that destroyed the inn in which she was kept. Meanwhile Fritz, the countryman, has gone from bad to worse; he is drinking heavily and associates with the characters at the Black Cat Inn. He is there when Prince Otto, still searching for Rose, enters the place in disguise. Just as the Prince enters, Fritz is engaged in forcing his unwelcome attentions upon Rose, who is trying to sell flowers. Observing this annoyance, the Prince interferes for the girl, and has a terrific fight with her insulter. The Prince gives Fritz a sound thrashing, and compels him to beg the girl's pardon. To show then that he is a good fellow, the Prince buys Fritz a drink. He learns from Fritz that Rose belongs to the old ""Wolf."" and on hearing the story of her ill-treatment at his hands, he makes a bargain with the ""Wolf"" and buys Rose from him. In the goodness of his heart, he tells Fritz to come along with them and he will give him work. With his usual cunning, the old ""Wolf"" sends his son to follow the Prince and his companions.

                    Silas Croft was a kindly old Englishman who had a farm in South Africa. With him resided his two nieces, whom he had taken from their drunken, worthless father when they were of a tender age. Jess, the elder, was brilliant and educated; Bess, the younger was beautiful, but frankly admitted that she did not possess the mental attainments of Jess. The two were great friends, and Jess, although the senior by only three years, had almost a motherly affection for her pretty little sister. Croft, finding old age stealing upon him, advertised for a partner, stipulating that he must be a gentleman. Probably it was his secret idea that the right man might come along, and fall in love with his favorite, beautiful Bessie. Captain John Neil, an English army officer, who had found his income insufficient to support him in his profession, heard of the business opportunity and accepted it. Jess, the unimpressionable, speedily fell in love with him, and her womanly intuition told her that she could win him, for he was fascinated by her. The girl was happy for a while, but suddenly learned that her little sister was also in love with the handsome Englishman. The elder sister realized that happiness for her, meant sorrow, probably life-long sorrow, for Bess. Accustomed to making sacrifices for the girl she so tenderly loved, Jess made another. On the pretext of a visit to an old school friend, she absented herself from home, knowing that Neil would be bound to fall in love with Bess, who was beautiful and amiable. The expected happened. At the time Jess departed, Neil liked both girls, but preferred Jess. Thrown into daily companionship with Bess, he soon grew to love her, and made her happy by proposing to her. And little sister wrote to big sister, telling her the glorious news, never even suspecting the truth. Jess received the letter in her place of refuge, and rejoiced that she had been able to ensure the happiness of Bess, while at the same time she wept in secret over the fate that had taken all romance out of her young life. At this time, the rebellion which freed the Transvaal from British rule was brewing. Croft, who at first doubted that any trouble was impending, at last realizes the gravity of the situation, and Neil consents to go to Pretoria and bring Jess home before it is too late. The gallant soldier arrives in the city, but is unable to leave with his charge, because the Boers have besieged the place, and even couriers cannot pierce the lines. A certain Frank Muller, son of a Boer and an Englishwoman, is one of the leaders in the revolt. He had proposed to Bess and been rejected. Learning that his successful rival is in Pretoria, he plans to dispose of him. Pretending great friendliness, he sends Neil a pass for Jess and himself, signed by Oom Paul Kruger. The unsuspecting Englishman falls into the trap, and with the girl, leaves under the charge of a Boer escort, furnished by Muller. These men have been tricked into believing that Kruger has ordered that the couple be killed, and while they are crossing a river, fire upon them and believe they are slain. Jess and Neil, however, have a miraculous escape. Following the crossing of the river under fire, on their way to Pretoria, Jess and Neil become separated, and the girl reaches the farm alone. There she finds that the villain Muller has been ahead of her, and that her uncle is a prisoner, on a charge of treason. Muller, who is military head of the district, tells Bess that Croft will be convicted and hanged unless Bess consents to marry him. The girl, however, refuses, the court-martial is held, and when Jess arrives, her uncle is under sentence to die at dawn, a few hours away. There is no one to whom she can appeal, and Jess, grief-stricken, decides to be her own avenger. Muller is asleep in his tent, waiting for the dawn when the last of the protectors of the girl he covets shall be separated from her by death. He awakes with a start. Bending over him is Jess. He believes it is a visitor from another world, for he could have sworn that he had seen her die a horrible death. Stricken with terror, unable to speak or make a motion, he goes to his death, his last thought being that there is a life beyond the grave, and that evil brings its own punishment. Jess wanders away into the desert and dies. Neil, searching, finds the body. The troubles of the others are finally swept away, and Neil and Bess live happily many years in their English home, never realizing that they owe everything to the self-sacrificing Jess, although they sincerely mourn and miss her.

                    Hazel Phillips, a young girl, is courted by two young men, Evans and Porter, in a western town. She favors Porter, and the two are married. Evans conceals his chagrin and jealousy, and continues as a friend of the young couple. One day a prospector comes into town with a bag of gold dust and nuggets, and tells an interested crowd of the big strike made in the southwest. Evans decides to seek his fortune there, and persuades Porter to accompany him. Hazel consents, and bids her husband an affectionate farewell. The two men strike through the desert, and after months of hardship and privation Porter finally finds gold. His extreme jealousy has made Evans content to have Porter with him, as he gloated to himself that he was keeping him away from Hazel. When Porter runs in with the glad news, Evans becomes madly angered, as he realizes that Porter will go back to his wife with a fortune. An insane rage, seizes him as he realizes how happy they will be. Before the astonished Porter can defend himself, Evans leaps upon him and strikes him to the earth with the butt of his pistol. The injured man staggers to his feet, but is no match for the infuriated Evans, who rains blow after blow upon his partner's head. Porter sinks to the ground, and Evans leaves him for dead. Evans goes to Hazel and tells her a false story of how Porter died of illness, how he nursed him through it all, and how he had come to convey her husband's dying message to her. Porter is found by a tribe of Indians and nursed back to life. He recovers his health and strength but his memory is a blank, and he is adopted into the tribe. Evans goes back to the gold mine and works it. Knowing that Hazel will soon be in want, having lost her parents and with a baby to support, he lays his trap cunningly. When he goes back to ask her to marry him he finally wins her consent by persuading her it is for the good of her baby, and she accompanies him back to the wild, western country, where he has built a cabin. A few days after her arrival, the baby wanders off into the woods and is playing on the banks of a brook when it is taken by Indians. As they are hurrying away with the child Porter appears, and the sight of the innocent baby arouses him. Not knowing that it is his own child, he makes them set her free, and she runs home with a tale which her mother believes is only childish imagination. Silently and noiselessly, Porter watches the woman through the window, and the sight of her face touches his slumbering memory, but does not awaken it. Troubled, he goes back to the camp, unable to untangle the confused thoughts which crowd upon his brain. At this time the government agent, accompanied by an escort of soldiers, calls upon the Indians and serves notice on them to vacate the land and move to a reservation. The Indians resent the order, and wild disorder prevails in the village. Somebody strikes a blow, ready weapons spring forth, and in a moment an avalanche of redskins throw themselves upon the soldiers. Porter is struck on the head with the butt of a rifle, and the shock instantly clears his mind. The face of the woman in the cabin comes before him, and he knows it is Hazel. The soldiers put up a futile resistance, and are soon dispatched. Porter knows that it is but the beginning, that the Indians will go on the warpath, that they will hurl themselves upon the emigrants and settlers, leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake, and he thinks of Hazel and the baby. He rushes away, hoping to reach the cabin before the rest of the tribe arrive, and succeeds. With the lapse of years, in his paint and feathers, he is not recognized by Hazel at first. From the window they see the long line of Indians thundering toward them. There is no time to be lost, so Porter throws a table behind the door, crowds Hazel and the baby behind it, and stands there unconcernedly. The Indians rush in and demolish and steal everything, but are adroitly kept from discovering the woman and child. Evans comes home. The Indians hide, and as he approaches the cabin he is attacked and killed, his body stripped of his clothes, and the Indians go on. In the meantime the soldiers have been rushed to the scene of warfare, and corner the redskins engaging them in a terrific fight, in which the Indians are badly defeated. Porter, with the cunning learned from the Indians, has managed to bring his wife and child to a place of safety, and the reunion is splendidly acted. The last scene shows the vengeance of fate, the dilapidated cabin, with the bones of Evans lying in front, around which coyotes are sniffing.

                    Little Gerta, when her mother dies. is brought to her father, Carl Von Seydling, a government official, who deserted his wife and child a few years before. Councilor Van Seydling found the child's presence in his household to be cumbersome and for that reason turned her over to one Sarah Anderson, a nurse. Although Van Seydling did not know it, the Anderson woman was a notorious fagin. She promptly sold Gerta to a beggar, who taught her to beg and to steal. One of her begging trips brings Gerta to the attention of a young man named Alm Stoddard, He becomes interested in the pretty child and upon learning her story is horrified. The police are notified. They arrest her supposed father, but Sarah Anderson escapes. Little Gerta is adopted by Alm's mother and grows to be a beautiful young woman. Alm falls in love with her, but Gerta has lost her heart to the dashing Lieutenant Wiles. Through Alm's efforts the character of this man is shown to Gerta, and thus she is warned in time. Lieutenant Wiles challenges Alm to a duel and in the encounter Alm is wounded slightly. Gerta, frightened by the trouble she has caused, disappears, leaving a note begging the Stoddards to forgive her seeming ingratitude. Some years later a grand opera star, Mlle. Hauser, has taken the public by storm. Among her admirers is Alm Stoddard, although he is too fainthearted to write to her or tell her that he knows her to be little Gerta. She, from behind the footlights, has recognized him but, fearing he has not forgiven her, makes no sign of recognition. Another man, in constant attendance at the opera, is Councilor Van Seydling, who has long since believed his daughter dead. By a strange coincidence Sarah Anderson is employed as Gerta's maid. She has not reformed any and when she steals Mlle, Hauser's handbag she extracts a picture of a very little girl. Looking at the picture Sarah suddenly realizes that Mlle. Hauser is none other than little Gerta. That evening the audience is assembled when a fire breaks out. In the panic that follows Alm is the only one who remembers Gerta. At the risk of his life he brings the unconscious girl out of danger. At the corner drug store Sarah Anderson, mortally injured, is dying. She bares the story of her life and among the listeners is Councilor Von Seydling. The memory of his misdeeds strikes terror to his heart. Van Seydling hurries out and, finding his daughter in the arms of Alm, begs her to forgive him. The girl is mystified, but a little explaining clears the situation. Following custom, Alm asks her father for her hand. Von Seydling asks Gerta to decide and she, clinging to Alm, smiles her contentment.

                    Joe Godfrey is only half a hero, but Mabel Kemp loves him. Mabel's father is an old G.A.R. man and sternly sets his foot down against Joe, calling him a coward because he has not done a deed of bravery to prove himself anything else. Mabel and Joe manage to get together and exchange notes in the groceries which she and her father purchase from the store where Joe works. The old man, in order to keep Mabel away from her lover, goes to the store himself, little knowing that he is acting as love's emissary, carrying in one of the packages Joe's message to Mabel. Joe plans an elopement and considers himself a hero to defy his future father-in-law and carry off his daughter. Mabel makes all preparations to get away with Joe. He is just assisting her from an upper window when some rubbish catches fire and fills the house with smoke, which arouses the father, who is busily reading in the lower part of the house. Rushing out doors, he cries for help and someone to save his daughter. Just then Joe appears in the window with Mabel in his arms, amid the cheers of the crowd and the belated fire department. He is hailed as a hero and receives the consent of Mabel's father to their marriage.
