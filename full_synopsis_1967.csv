As the film opens, Lucas Jackson (Paul Newman) is using a pipe cutter to cut the tops off of parking meters. He is drinking, possibly drunk, but not violent. When the police arrive, he is peacefully arrested. Apparently off-screen, he is tried, convicted of destroying public property, and sentenced to two years in prison.Luke and three other men have been sentenced to a rural Florida road gang performing hard labor.

Something he did got him busted back down to the same rank at which he entered the Army.Dragline (George Kennedy) is clearly the leader of the prisoners. He is uneducated and illiterate, but smarter, stronger, bigger, and does not hesitate to exercise his power over them. Most of the prisoners willingly submit to Dragline, but Luke does not. There is no open opposition to Dragline, just a casual refusal to change his behavior in order to please others. Nevertheless, Dragline sees this as a threat to his power and dominance.The men leave at sunset and perform over 12 hours daily of grueling hard labor under intense heat and humidity on the side of the road cutting grass with a sickle or shoveling dirt. One of the new prisoners passes out the first day and another one tries to get out of the detail by sweeping, which was a trick played on him. Luke makes it the first day, but exhausted and barely able to get back into the truck.At the end of the first day for the new men, Alibi, the one who tried to get out of the hard labor by sweeping, is made to sleep in the box the first night, a cramped isolation unit outside to learn a lesson to not challenge the guards.After Luke says something that Dragline takes as a challenge to his authority, Dragline arranges for he and Luke to have a boxing match. Being much larger, Dragline simply pounds Luke into a pulp, but Luke will not give up, or stay down on the ground. What begins as a boxing match with enthusiastic prisoners and guards watching slowly turns into a sad spectacle. Prisoners begin to plead with Luke to lay down and refuse to get back up, and eventually Dragline himself pleads with Luke to simply stop fighting back, but Luke will not stop. The prisoners begin to walk away, unable to watch the sad scene any longer. Dragline himself wants the fight to end, and at one point has to catch the beaten and exhausted Luke from falling down, carrying him across his shoulder and gently setting him on the ground, only to have Luke use what little strength he has left to tap Dragline with one last punch. Finally, even Dragline cannot continue. The only men who are still watching are the guards and the warden, but the warden seems concerned about Luke's stubbornness and the guards remain indifferent.Luke becomes the prisoners' hero, and even Dragline is now respectful of Luke during a card game that night of having tricked a fellow opponent on betting with a bad hand dealt, giving him the name ""Cool Hand Luke.""On the chain gang, Luke encourages the other prisoners, by his own attitude and energy, to excel at their menial tasks. This not only encourages camaraderie among the prisoners, it deprives the guards of a stick to hold over the prisoners' heads. The prisoners are forced to shovel sand over a freshly tarred road, and they perform the job so quickly and with such a sense of competition that they complete the job early, and thus by default earn a few hours of relaxation, because there is no more road on which to work.On a Sunday, Luke's mother comes to visit him, visibly ill and dying of cancer or emphysema and still chain-smoking, and it is clear that Luke gets his independent streak from her. He admired her ability to live life on her own terms, and has tried to emulate that, but with much different results.During one very hot and rainy night, Luke decides out of the blue that he can eat 50 eggs. Most of the other prisoners oppose and that it's impossible or will kill him, but Dragline begins to take bets. Luke barely succeeds at it and collects all the money from bets. Soon after, Luke receives a telegram that his mother has died.The warden uses the death of Luke's mother as an excuse to lock him in ""the box,"" solitary confinement in a hot wooden shed. The warden claims that men will often run away when their relatives die, so he locks Luke up until after Luke's mother is buried. This has the opposite effect, and Luke promptly escapes after being released from solitary.Luke is later caught, after mailing a picture and magazine back to his former fellow prisoners. He is double-chained, but escapes a second time. Again, he is recaptured. While Luke is becoming the ""hero"" of his fellow prisoners, it is a role he does not want. He admonishes them to ""stop feeding off me,"" to stop living life vicariously through his acts.The guards and warden determine to break Luke's will. They force him to dig and bury, then re-dig and re-bury, a ditch. He is beaten and tormented, until he finally begs God to spare him from the warden and guards. They take this as a sign that he is finally a broken man, and Luke himself later admits that it did break him.A few days later, the guards have now made Luke a trustee. Nonetheless, when he is later given an opportunity, he seizes it and escapes again, stealing one of the prison trucks to make his get-away. This time, Dragline decides to go with Luke. Only later, after their escape, does Dragline weigh out the consequences. He had only two years left on his sentence, but now - if caught - will probably have many more years in prison.Dragline wants to team up with Luke, but Luke tells him that he wants to go alone. Luke has always been an individual, not a conventional leader, and does not want to take on that role now. Luke goes into a church, after being completely irreverent to God through the entire film, and asks God to help him escape. But the warden and guards arrive, and when Luke mocks them from the church window, he is shot.The local police want to take Luke to the hospital, but the warden insists that they take him back to prison instead. It is clear that Luke will not make it that far, but the warden heads off with Luke in his car.

He is the true anti-hero, never wanting to be anybody's role model, just wanting to live life on his own terms. But like the guard's sunglasses, Luke managed to unmask the injustice and hypocrisy of the system in which he was confined. Basically, he gave up his life over a parking meter, but in the final analysis he could not be broken by the system.","
    
                    Luke Jackson is a cool, gutsy prisoner in a Southern chain gang, who, while refusing to buckle under to authority, keeps escaping and being recaptured.

"2","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film explores the life of 21-year-old Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) shortly after earning his bachelor's degree from an unnamed college in the Northeast. The school is widely believed to be Williams College, Webb's alma mater (in the opening sequence of the movie, Dustin Hoffman, playing Benjamin Braddock, is wearing a Williams College tie). Benjamin is seen arriving at LAX International Airport over the opening credits.The movie really begins at a party that same evening celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles. Benjamin is visibly uncomfortable at the party attended by his parents' friends. He remains aloof while his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. Benjamin escapes from each person who comes to congratulate him, exposing his seeming embarrassment at all the honors he had won at college. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the neglected wife of his father's law partner, asks Benjamin to drive her home, which he reluctantly does. We never learn Mrs. Robinson's first name (or, indeed, the first names of any of Benjamin's and Elaine's parents) during the course of the film (in the novel, we are told that the initial of Mrs. Robinson's first name is G).Arriving at her home, she pleads for Benjamin to come inside, saying that she doesn't like to enter a dark house alone. Once inside, she forces a drink on him, and later exposes herself to him offering to have an affair with him. This scene, known as the ""Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me"" scene, as said by Benjamin, is said to be one of the most iconic scenes in the film. She, for no clear reason, does attempt to seduce him, removing her clothing. Mr. Robinson arrives home a few minute later, but does not see or suspect anything. Initially flustered and shocked by her advances, Benjamin flees into the night.A few days later Benjamin contacts Mrs. Robinson and clumsily organizes a tryst at a hotel beginning their affair. A now confident and relaxed Benjamin spends the summer drifting around in the pool by day and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. Benjamin is clearly uncomfortable with sexuality, but he is drawn into the affair with the older, but still attractive, Mrs. Robinson. Their affair appears to last most of the summer. All of their scenes pass in a musically-backed montage, showing the endless pass of time. One scene is edited so that it appears Benjamin is walking directly from his parents' dining room into the hotel room he shares with Mrs. Robinson. This seems to accent the separation of he and his parents, though they still live under the same roof. Benjamin discovers that they have nothing to talk about but, she refuses to talk and only wants sex. After pestering her one evening, Mrs. Robinson tells Benjamin that she was forced to give up college and marry someone she didn't love when she became pregnant with her daughter Elaine.Meanwhile, Benjamin is hounded by his father to select a graduate school to attend. Benjamin, clearly not interested in pursuing his studies, shrugs off his father's wishes and spends his time lounging about and sleeping with Mrs. Robinson. His affair may serve as an escape from his lack of direction or ambition, and his fear and anxiety of his impending future. Mr. Robinson, unaware of his wife's budding affair, encourages Benjamin to call on his daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross). Benjamin's parents also repeatedly encourage him to date her. During one liaison, Mrs. Robinson forces a promise from Ben to never date Elaine. Whether out of fear of Mrs. Robinson, or sensing that getting involved with the daughter of his lover could be disastrous, he tries to avoid it. However, because of the three parents' persistent intervention, he is essentially forced to date her.Therefore, he tries to ensure his date with her will be a disaster so she would not want to pursue a relationship with him. He drives recklessly, practically ignoring Elaine, and then takes her to a strip club where she is openly humiliated and silently begins to cry. After making her cry he relents and explains he was mean only because his parents forced him to ask her out. He awkwardly kisses her to try and cheer her up and they go and get a burger at a drive-in. Benjamin discovers that Elaine is someone he is comfortable with and that he can talk to her about his worries.From here, Benjamin's life falls apart. The jealous Mrs. Robinson threatens to reveal their affair to destroy any chance Benjamin has with Elaine, so Benjamin rashly decides he has to tell Elaine first. Upset over hearing about Benjamin's tryst with her mother, Elaine returns to Berkeley refusing to speak with Benjamin.Benjamin decides he is going to marry Elaine in order to have a future with her and goes to Berkeley where he rents a room in a local flop house, and begins to stalk her. He contrives a meeting on a bus while she is on her way to a date with her classmate Carl. The next day, an angry Elaine bursts into Benjamin's room and demands to know what he is doing in Berkeley after he ""raped"" her mother by taking advantage of her while she was drunk that evening of his graduation party. Shocked by what Elaine said, Benjamin tells her it was her mother who seduced him that night, but Elaine refuses to believe him and doesn't want to hear the fact that her mother is a crafty vixen. Benjamin says he will leave Berkeley and go somewhere else for her sake. Elaine tells Benjamin not to leave until he has a definite plan at what he wants to do with his life.The next day, Elaine comes into Ben's apartment in the middle of the night and asks him to kiss her. Over the next few days, the two hang out in Berkeley while Benjamin keeps pressing her to get blood tests so that they can get married. Elaine is unsure about this and tells him she had told Carl she might marry him.Mr. Robinson, who has found out everything about Benjamin and his wife's affair, goes to Ben's apartment in Berkeley where he threatens Benjamin with violence and forces Elaine to drop out of school and takes her away to marry Carl. Benjamin tells Mr. Robinson that his wife is the bad person and she manipulated him into having an affair with her. But Mr. Robinson also is skeptic and refuses to belive Benjamin. Benjamin is left with just a note from Elaine saying that she loves him but that her father is really angry and it can never work out.Benjamin drives back to Pasadena and arrives at the Robinson house that evening looking for Elaine. After getting no response by knocking on the front door, goes around to the back of the house and forces open a screen door. Benjamin quickly sees that Elaine is not there, but finds Mrs. Robinson instead. She coldly tells him he won't be able stop Elaine and Carl's wedding and she immediately calls the police and play-acts by claiming that a man broke into her house and is assaulting her. Finally seeing the sociopath that Mrs. Robinson really is, Benjamin flees and drives back to Berkeley to hide out there.The next morning, Benjamin goes to the Delta Chi Fraternity house to look for Elaine or Carl where he learns from Carl's frat brothers that the wedding is in Santa Barbara that very morning. Benjamin then speeds off towards Santa Barbara, stopping only at a gas station to ask for directions to the church. Benjamin is in such a hurry that he rushes off without refueling.Consequently, Ben runs out of gas and must sprint the last few blocks. He arrives at the church just as the bride and groom are about to kiss. Thinking he is too late, he bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams out ""Elaine!"" repeatedly. Elaine turns around, hesitates by looking at her parents and her would-be husband, but then screams out ""Ben!"" and starts running towards him. A brawl breaks out as everyone tries to stop her and Benjamin from leaving. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who claims ""It's too late!"" for Elaine apparently already said her marriage vows, to which Elaine replies, ""Not for me!"" Benjamin holds everybody off by swinging a cross ripped from the wall, then using it to jam the outside door while the pair escape. They run down the road and flag down a bus. The elated and smiling couple take the back seat. But in the final shot, Benjamin's smile gradually fades to an enigmatic, neutral expression as he gazes forward down the bus, not looking at Elaine. Elaine also seems unsure, looks lovingly across at Ben but notices his expression and turns away with a similar expression as the bus drives away, taking the two lovers to an uncertain future.","

Although the world should be his oyster, Ben is instead in a state of extreme anxiety as he has no idea what to do with his life, which is made all the more difficult since everybody asks him what he plans on doing or tells him what he should do. In his confused state during which he would rather be alone to wallow in self-pity, he is easy prey for the aggressive Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner who he's known all his life and who seduces him. Thinking about and then eventually succumbing to her advances only adds to his anxiety and confusion as he hides what they're doing from the rest of the world, and as he needs more than just sex in a relationship, sex which is all she wants from him. His confusion is lessened but his life becomes more complicated when he is reacquainted with Elaine Robinson, the Robinsons' daughter who too is home from college at Berkeley and who he has not seen since high school. Despite a rocky start directed largely by the wants of Mrs. Robinson, Ben and Elaine start to fall for each other.

We never learn Mrs. Robinson's first name (or, indeed, the first names of any of Benjamin's and Elaine's parents) during the course of the film (in the novel, we are told that the initial of Mrs. Robinson's first name is G).Arriving at her home, she pleads for Benjamin to come inside, saying that she doesn't like to enter a dark house alone. Once inside, she forces a drink on him, and later exposes herself to him offering to have an affair with him. This scene, known as the ""Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me"" scene, as said by Benjamin, is said to be one of the most iconic scenes in the film. She, for no clear reason, does attempt to seduce him, removing her clothing. Mr. Robinson arrives home a few minute later, but does not see or suspect anything. Initially flustered and shocked by her advances, Benjamin flees into the night.A few days later Benjamin contacts Mrs. Robinson and clumsily organizes a tryst at a hotel beginning their affair. A now confident and relaxed Benjamin spends the summer drifting around in the pool by day and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. Benjamin is clearly uncomfortable with sexuality, but he is drawn into the affair with the older, but still attractive, Mrs. Robinson. Their affair appears to last most of the summer. All of their scenes pass in a musically-backed montage, showing the endless pass of time. One scene is edited so that it appears Benjamin is walking directly from his parents' dining room into the hotel room he shares with Mrs. Robinson. This seems to accent the separation of he and his parents, though they still live under the same roof. Benjamin discovers that they have nothing to talk about but, she refuses to talk and only wants sex. After pestering her one evening, Mrs. Robinson tells Benjamin that she was forced to give up college and marry someone she didn't love when she became pregnant with her daughter Elaine.Meanwhile, Benjamin is hounded by his father to select a graduate school to attend. Benjamin, clearly not interested in pursuing his studies, shrugs off his father's wishes and spends his time lounging about and sleeping with Mrs. Robinson. His affair may serve as an escape from his lack of direction or ambition, and his fear and anxiety of his impending future. Mr. Robinson, unaware of his wife's budding affair, encourages Benjamin to call on his daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross). Benjamin's parents also repeatedly encourage him to date her. During one liaison, Mrs. Robinson forces a promise from Ben to never date Elaine. Whether out of fear of Mrs. Robinson, or sensing that getting involved with the daughter of his lover could be disastrous, he tries to avoid it. However, because of the three parents' persistent intervention, he is essentially forced to date her.Therefore, he tries to ensure his date with her will be a disaster so she would not want to pursue a relationship with him. He drives recklessly, practically ignoring Elaine, and then takes her to a strip club where she is openly humiliated and silently begins to cry. After making her cry he relents and explains he was mean only because his parents forced him to ask her out. He awkwardly kisses her to try and cheer her up and they go and get a burger at a drive-in. Benjamin discovers that Elaine is someone he is comfortable with and that he can talk to her about his worries.From here, Benjamin's life falls apart. The jealous Mrs. Robinson threatens to reveal their affair to destroy any chance Benjamin has with Elaine, so Benjamin rashly decides he has to tell Elaine first. Upset over hearing about Benjamin's tryst with her mother, Elaine returns to Berkeley refusing to speak with Benjamin.Benjamin decides he is going to marry Elaine in order to have a future with her and goes to Berkeley where he rents a room in a local flop house, and begins to stalk her. He contrives a meeting on a bus while she is on her way to a date with her classmate Carl. The next day, an angry Elaine bursts into Benjamin's room and demands to know what he is doing in Berkeley after he ""raped"" her mother by taking advantage of her while she was drunk that evening of his graduation party. Shocked by what Elaine said, Benjamin tells her it was her mother who seduced him that night, but Elaine refuses to believe him and doesn't want to hear the fact that her mother is a crafty vixen. Benjamin says he will leave Berkeley and go somewhere else for her sake. Elaine tells Benjamin not to leave until he has a definite plan at what he wants to do with his life.The next day, Elaine comes into Ben's apartment in the middle of the night and asks him to kiss her. Over the next few days, the two hang out in Berkeley while Benjamin keeps pressing her to get blood tests so that they can get married. Elaine is unsure about this and tells him she had told Carl she might marry him.Mr. Robinson, who has found out everything about Benjamin and his wife's affair, goes to Ben's apartment in Berkeley where he threatens Benjamin with violence and forces Elaine to drop out of school and takes her away to marry Carl. Benjamin tells Mr. Robinson that his wife is the bad person and she manipulated him into having an affair with her. But Mr. Robinson also is skeptic and refuses to belive Benjamin. Benjamin is left with just a note from Elaine saying that she loves him but that her father is really angry and it can never work out.Benjamin drives back to Pasadena and arrives at the Robinson house that evening looking for Elaine. After getting no response by knocking on the front door, goes around to the back of the house and forces open a screen door. Benjamin quickly sees that Elaine is not there, but finds Mrs. Robinson instead. She coldly tells him he won't be able stop Elaine and Carl's wedding and she immediately calls the police and play-acts by claiming that a man broke into her house and is assaulting her. Finally seeing the sociopath that Mrs. Robinson really is, Benjamin flees and drives back to Berkeley to hide out there.The next morning, Benjamin goes to the Delta Chi Fraternity house to look for Elaine or Carl where he learns from Carl's frat brothers that the wedding is in Santa Barbara that very morning. Benjamin then speeds off towards Santa Barbara, stopping only at a gas station to ask for directions to the church. Benjamin is in such a hurry that he rushes off without refueling.Consequently, Ben runs out of gas and must sprint the last few blocks. He arrives at the church just as the bride and groom are about to kiss. Thinking he is too late, he bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams out ""Elaine!"" repeatedly. Elaine turns around, hesitates by looking at her parents and her would-be husband, but then screams out ""Ben!"" and starts running towards him. A brawl breaks out as everyone tries to stop her and Benjamin from leaving. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who claims ""It's too late!"" for Elaine apparently already said her marriage vows, to which Elaine replies, ""Not for me!"" Benjamin holds everybody off by swinging a cross ripped from the wall, then using it to jam the outside door while the pair escape. They run down the road and flag down a bus. The elated and smiling couple take the back seat. But in the final shot, Benjamin's smile gradually fades to an enigmatic, neutral expression as he gazes forward down the bus, not looking at Elaine. Elaine also seems unsure, looks lovingly across at Ben but notices his expression and turns away with a similar expression as the bus drives away, taking the two lovers to an uncertain future.

Their mission: a stealth attack on a posh vacation chateau for Wehrmacht officers in occupied France, in hopes of disrupting German command before an Allied invasion.It's essentially a suicide mission, and the proposed soldiers are bizarre. After reviewing their qualifications, their crime history, and an interview, twelve military convicts sentenced to death or life prison terms are asked to volunteer in return for full pardons.

                    US army Major John Reisman, based in London, is an inventive man who often thinks outside the box which causes many problems in the structured military. But it is because of this mentality that in March 1944, he is assigned, or as his superiors put it volunteers for a near suicide mission. Prior to the Allied forces invading continental Europe, he and his team, who he will train personally with Sergeant Bowren as his second in command, will infiltrate a highly fortified and guarded French château being used by the Nazis as respite house and meeting place primarily for high ranking German officers, kill as many of the officers as possible and take out the communications tower. His squad will consist of twelve of the most heavily sentenced GI convicts, many whose sentence is death. Reisman, who doesn't like the assignment because of the involvement of the convicts, adds one caveat to doing this job: that the convicts have their sentences commuted if they survive. Reisman quickly learns that besides a resentment to authority, the twelve convicts are a disparate group, each with their own button issues and motivations. Reisman not only has to get them to cooperate, but work as a team, which includes having a zero tolerance policy for the group as a whole on issues such as escape attempts while under his command. Even if he can achieve these goals, Reisman also faces the obstacle of Colonel Everett Breed, who is the antithesis of Reisman and who will be at the parachute training base at the same time as Reisman's squad, for which Breed has disdain.

A panther named Bagheera one day comes across an abandoned boat, in which a small baby is seen. Taking pity on the baby, Bagheera takes it to a small family of wolves, who adopt the boy.10 years pass, and Mowgli has grown into a wiry young boy, who has long since been adopted into his wolf pack, despite his differences. However, word has reached the pack that the tiger Shere Khan has been spotted in the jungle. The pack knows of Khan's hatred of 'man,' and wish to send Mowgli away for protection. Bagheera volunteers to take Mowgli to a man-village some distance away. Mowgli and Bagheera set out sometime after dark. They stay in a tree for the night, but are disturbed by Kaa, a python with a hypnotic gaze, who tries to hypnotize both of them, before being pushed out of the tree by Mowgli.The next day, they are awakened by 'The Dawn Patrol,' a pack of elephants led by Colonel Hathi. Mowgli spends a few moments with their son, who one day dreams of following in his Father's footsteps. Bagheera orders Mowgli to continue on their way to the man-village, but Mowgli refuses. After some struggles, Bagheera and Mowgli separat, fed up with the other's company.As Mowgli sulks by a rock, he is suddenly discovered by Baloo, a large bear with a care-free attitude. Bagheera hears the commotion caused by the two of them, and returns, dismayed that Mowgli has encountered the 'jungle bum.' Baloo's 'philosophy' of living care-free in the jungle easily takes hold of the young man-cub, and Mowgli now wishes to stay with Baloo. However, a group of monkeys suddenly appear, and take Mowgli away.Mowgli is taken to some ancient ruins, lorded over by an orangutan named King Louie, who figures since Mowgli is a man-cub, he can help him learn how to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo show up shortly, and after a fierce chase, get Mowgli away from King Louie.As Mowgli rests from the ordeal, Bagheera explains to Baloo why Mowgli must leave the jungle, and after telling Baloo of the danger that Shere Khan poses to him, Baloo reluctantly agrees to take Mowgli back, even though he had promised Mowgli he could stay in the jungle with him. When Mowgli finds out about this, he runs off again.After some time going through the jungle, Mowgli encounters Kaa, who hypnotizes the boy. Kaa is just about to eat Mowgli, when he is alerted to Shere Khan. Kaa manages to carry on a conversation with the tiger, and just barely hides the fact that the man-cub is nearby. Once Shere Khan leaves, Kaa's plans to eat Mowgli are foiled when Mowgli comes out of his trance, and is able to escape.Sometime afterward, Mowgli chances upon a group of vultures, who are willing to take him in as one of their own. However, before they can do so, Shere Khan appears. Even though he is feared by the vultures, Mowgli refuses to run. Just as it seems that Shere Khan may devour Mowgli, Baloo appears, and wrestles with the tiger, who ends up clawing at the large bear. In the ensuing chaos, Mowgli ties a flaming branch to Shere Khan's tail, and the fire spooks the tiger, sending him running away.Just when it appears that Baloo has died, he recovers from the ordeal. Bagheera soon joins the group, and the three of them set off back through the jungle.It seems that Bagheera's plan to get Mowgli to the man-village have failed, when a beautiful song wafts through their ears. As the three of them look through some bushes, they see the man-village, and by a small stream, a little girl appears, gathering water. This intrigues Mowgli, who tries to go for a closer look. Seeing the boy, the girl pretends to spill her water jug. Mowgli retrieves it, refills it, but instead of taking it, the girl leads him back to the man-village, humming her 'siren song.' Baloo whispers for Mowgli to come back, but the boy follows the girl into the village.Bagheera happily explains that Mowgli is now where he belongs, and Baloo accepts this fact, before wrapping an arm around the panther, and the two of them return to the jungle.","
    
                    Abandoned after an accident, baby Mowgli is taken and raised by a family of wolves. As the boy grows older, the wise panther Bagheera realizes he must be returned to his own kind in the nearby man-village. Baloo the bear however thinks differently taking the young Mowgli under his wing and teaching that living in the jungle is the best life there is. Bagheera realizes that Mowgli is in danger, particularly from Shere Khan the tiger who hates all people. When Baloo finally comes around, Mowgli runs off into the jungle where he survives a second encounter with Kaa the snake and finally, with Shere Khan. It's the sight of a pretty girl however that gets Mowgli to go the nearby man-village.

    Synopsis
    The story of ""The Jungle Book"" concerns a young man-cub named Mowgli. A panther named Bagheera one day comes across an abandoned boat, in which a small baby is seen. Taking pity on the baby, Bagheera takes it to a small family of wolves, who adopt the boy.10 years pass, and Mowgli has grown into a wiry young boy, who has long since been adopted into his wolf pack, despite his differences. However, word has reached the pack that the tiger Shere Khan has been spotted in the jungle. The pack knows of Khan's hatred of 'man,' and wish to send Mowgli away for protection. Bagheera volunteers to take Mowgli to a man-village some distance away. Mowgli and Bagheera set out sometime after dark. They stay in a tree for the night, but are disturbed by Kaa, a python with a hypnotic gaze, who tries to hypnotize both of them, before being pushed out of the tree by Mowgli.The next day, they are awakened by 'The Dawn Patrol,' a pack of elephants led by Colonel Hathi. Mowgli spends a few moments with their son, who one day dreams of following in his Father's footsteps. Bagheera orders Mowgli to continue on their way to the man-village, but Mowgli refuses. After some struggles, Bagheera and Mowgli separat, fed up with the other's company.As Mowgli sulks by a rock, he is suddenly discovered by Baloo, a large bear with a care-free attitude. Bagheera hears the commotion caused by the two of them, and returns, dismayed that Mowgli has encountered the 'jungle bum.' Baloo's 'philosophy' of living care-free in the jungle easily takes hold of the young man-cub, and Mowgli now wishes to stay with Baloo. However, a group of monkeys suddenly appear, and take Mowgli away.Mowgli is taken to some ancient ruins, lorded over by an orangutan named King Louie, who figures since Mowgli is a man-cub, he can help him learn how to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo show up shortly, and after a fierce chase, get Mowgli away from King Louie.As Mowgli rests from the ordeal, Bagheera explains to Baloo why Mowgli must leave the jungle, and after telling Baloo of the danger that Shere Khan poses to him, Baloo reluctantly agrees to take Mowgli back, even though he had promised Mowgli he could stay in the jungle with him. When Mowgli finds out about this, he runs off again.After some time going through the jungle, Mowgli encounters Kaa, who hypnotizes the boy. Kaa is just about to eat Mowgli, when he is alerted to Shere Khan. Kaa manages to carry on a conversation with the tiger, and just barely hides the fact that the man-cub is nearby. Once Shere Khan leaves, Kaa's plans to eat Mowgli are foiled when Mowgli comes out of his trance, and is able to escape.Sometime afterward, Mowgli chances upon a group of vultures, who are willing to take him in as one of their own. However, before they can do so, Shere Khan appears. Even though he is feared by the vultures, Mowgli refuses to run. Just as it seems that Shere Khan may devour Mowgli, Baloo appears, and wrestles with the tiger, who ends up clawing at the large bear. In the ensuing chaos, Mowgli ties a flaming branch to Shere Khan's tail, and the fire spooks the tiger, sending him running away.Just when it appears that Baloo has died, he recovers from the ordeal. Bagheera soon joins the group, and the three of them set off back through the jungle.It seems that Bagheera's plan to get Mowgli to the man-village have failed, when a beautiful song wafts through their ears. As the three of them look through some bushes, they see the man-village, and by a small stream, a little girl appears, gathering water. This intrigues Mowgli, who tries to go for a closer look. Seeing the boy, the girl pretends to spill her water jug. Mowgli retrieves it, refills it, but instead of taking it, the girl leads him back to the man-village, humming her 'siren song.' Baloo whispers for Mowgli to come back, but the boy follows the girl into the village.Bagheera happily explains that Mowgli is now where he belongs, and Baloo accepts this fact, before wrapping an arm around the panther, and the two of them return to the jungle.

                    New Yorkers Paul Bratter and Corie Bratter née Banks have just gotten married. He is a stuffed shirt just starting his career as a lawyer. She is an independently minded free spirit who prides herself on doing the illogical purely out of a sense of adventure, such acts as walking through Washington Square Park barefoot when it's 17°F outside. Their six day honeymoon at the Plaza Hotel shows that they can get to know each other easily in the biblical sense. But they will see if they can get to know each other in their real life when they move into their first apartment, a cozy (in other words, small), slightly broken down top floor unit in a five story walk-up. While Corie joyfully bounds up and down the stairs, Paul, always winded after the fact, hates the fact of having to walk up the six flights of stairs, if one includes the stairs that comprise the outside front stoop. Beyond the issues with the apartment itself, Paul and Corie will have to deal with an odd assortment of neighbors, most specifically eccentric senior Victor Velasco, who lives in the unusual attic and who would like to consider himself a dirty old man. Corie, worried about her single straight-laced mother Ethel Banks, wants to set her up with Victor. Without Corie or Paul truly realizing it, Ethel and Victor as a twosome is as illogical as Corie and Paul. What happens between Ethel and Victor may be a predictor if Corie and Paul's marriage can make it in the long run.

"8","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Orbiting over the Earth is Jupiter 16, a US space capsule manned by two astronauts. As they maintain radio contact with bases in Hawaii and Houston, one of the astronauts ventures outside to make routine repairs, when radar picks up another spacecraft closing fast. Radio contact is lost and the spacecraft opens up and swallows Jupiter 16, in the process severing the other astronaut's lifeline and leaving him to die in space.In Hong Kong, James Bond is enjoying a romantic encounter with a Chinese woman. She leaves the bed a pushes a button that levers it into the wall. Two men burst into the room with machine guns and spray the bed. When the police arrive, the woman has disappeared and Bond is found dead.A contentious meeting between US and Russian diplomats follows, brokered by a member of Britain's foreign service. The US believes the pirate spacecraft is Russian in origin, having tracked the ship in orbit before it ventured into the atmosphere; the US is to launch another capsule in three weeks and will regard interference with the ship as an act of war, and will launch a military attack on Russia should the capsule come under attack itself. Great Britain, however, believes the alien ship landed in the Sea of Japan based on tracking of the ship from a station in Singapore, and that a British official in Hong Kong is following this lead.MI6's best agent, James Bond, is ordered to investigate. His assassination in Hong Kong was a ruse to trick his enemies into believing he was dead so he can continue his mission undetected. He is ordered to Japan to meet with members of Japan's SIS. One, a beautiful woman named Aki, takes him to the home of Dikko Henderson, a British intelligence official living in Japan who has discovered information about the rogue spacecraft. Henderson theorizes that a third power is using Osato Chemicals, a vast multinational corporation, to launch spacecraft from Japan to attack US and Russian spacecrafts and trigger war between the two superpowers. However, Henderson is stabbed to death before he can reveal more. James subdues Henderson's killer, then takes his place and infiltrates Osato Chemicals to find more information. He battles with a large bodyguard and defeats him before he finds a safe containing paperwork and a film negative that he takes before being pursued by security guards.James is rescued by Aki, but he is now mistrustful. When Aki stops her car near a subway entrance James chases her, only to fall into a ""trap"" set by ""Tiger"" Tanaka, the head of Japanese SIS and the most secretive official in Tokyo. After verifying Tanaka's credentials via a codeword, James works with him and they examine the paperwork found in Osato's safe. It details the smuggling of LOX - technical shorthand for liquid oxygen for rocket fuel and which is also the name for smoked salmon, and the perfect cover. The film negative is of a supertanker, the Ning Po, the picture coming from an American tourist killed by whoever works for Osato Chemicals; the picture shows not only the ship but a small boat of fishing women, indicating the area is an outer island on the way to Shanghai. James theorizes that the international criminal consortium SPECTRE has a role in the space hijackings given their history of using private organizations for the actual legwork of a conspiracy in the service of other foreign powers.James spends the night at Tanaka's house, where he is given exotic hospitality in the form of being bathed by ""very sexiful"" young ladies and given a relaxing massage by one. James' massage is taken over by the shapely and scantily-dressed Aki, who has fallen in love with him, a love the two consummate.The next day James is arranged to meet with Mr. Osato in the guise of businessman Jim Fisher to negotiate a bulk-purchase of important chemicals. Osato surreptitiously X-rays James, finding he is armed, and James is given a drink by Osato's secretary, Helga Brandt, who is more than just an efficient aide-de-camp. Osato orders hitmen to kill James, but he and Aki escape and Tanaka dispatches the hitmen via a transport chopper sporting a giant magnet.Tanaka radios James and orders James and Aki to Kobe, where the Ning Po is being loaded for departure. James then urges Tanaka to contact M in London to dispatch ""Little Nellie"" and her father - a minicopter gunship built under the supervision of Major Geoffrey ""Q"" Boothroyd. After arriving at Kobe, James and Aki find tanks of liquid oxygen but the two are attacked by a gang of dockworkers. James fights them off to allow Aki to escape, and it appears James himself will get away - until he is ambushed and knocked unconscious.He is bound to a chair in Helga's room on the Ning Po, where she questions him about snooping around the dock and holds a plastic surgeon's instrument dangerously close to James to pry information from him. But she is also aroused by James' masculinity and allows herself to be seduced by him; after consummating their arousal she flies James in a private plane, then bails out and locks him in, but James manages to escape, land the crippled plane, and escape before it explodes.Returning to Tiger's house, James is given photos of the Ning Po showing she stopped at an outer island and offloaded an enormous stockpile of equipment, shown by a vastly lower waterline. The threesome meet ""Q"" and Little Nellie is assembled by Q's crew of specialists. Sporting a variety of powerful weapons aboard Little Nellie, James overflies the area islands and is attacked by four gunships which he shoots down and which leave no doubt as to the presence of SPECTRE.A scheduled Russian space shot, meanwhile, goes off, and is grabbed by the enemy rocket, which is tracked by the US Air Force before disappearing, seeming to confirm to the US that the Russians are behind the space hijackings and will now use the excuse of losing their own spacecraft to shoot down the next Jupiter launch.Both Osato and Helga Brandt meet with their leader in his headquarters after the rogue craft returns to it's base. The man's face is not shown however he holds a white cat and finishes a meeting with two scientists who designed the radar jamming system that has cloaked the location of the villain's base. Both men demand more money but acquiesce after his bodyguard, Hans, shows them his leader's pool of piranha. The two scientists leave and the mysterious villain flashes the x-ray showing Bond's Walther PPK and expresses his disappointment in both Osato and Brandt for failing to kill him. Both accuse each other of failure. The villain orders Brandt to leave and drops her into the piranha pool as she walks across its bridge; she is eaten alive. He then sharply orders Osato to kill Bond immediately.Bond is ordered to report to Tiger's palatial estate which also doubles as a ninja training camp. Tiger's plan is to use his army of men to infiltrate a fishing village on the island where the Ning Po last made port. Bond himself will be disguised as a Japanese man and will train with the rest of Tiger's ninja army; the army will later hide in the island's largest village as local fishermen. Bond will also take a wife; to his dismay, Aki will not be the woman because she is not from the village. After the procedure which disguises him, Bond and Aki spend the night together. While they sleep, an assassin sneaks into the rafters above their bed and lowers a needle on the end of a thread. He trickles a powerful poison down the thread, his target being Bond. Bond, however, shifts in his sleep. Aki also shifts at the same moment and the poison drips onto her mouth. As she struggles and dies, Bond wakes up and shoots the assassin dead. Tiger comes in and Bond tells him what happened. Bond seems more urgent than ever to investigate the plot but Tiger tells him he needs a few more days of training. The next day during a staff match, Bond is attacked again by another assassin who tries to stab him with a knife hidden in his weapon. Bond kills the man and Tiger identifies him, saying he's not one of his men. The next day Bond is wed to a lovely young woman from the fishing village, Kissy. The settle into a small house in the village and Kissy rejects Bond's advances to consummate their marriage. The two also notice a small funeral being held for a young girl who'd been exploring a nearby cave along the shoreline. When the girl's boat floated out of the cave, she was mysteriously dead. At early morning, Tiger warns Bond that the Americans are launching their next spacecraft today with a last warning to the Soviets! Bond becomes interested in the cave; the next morning, he and Kissy drift away from the fishing fleet and explore the cave. When they enter it, Bond immediately notices that a poison gas has been released in the cave and they jump over the side of their boat and swim inside. The come ashore and hike up to the volcano's caldera. They see a helicopter fly down into the basin but it disappears. A closer investigation reveals that the surface of the crater's lake is actually a gigantic metal cover that hides a secret base where the rogue rocket has been hiding after swallowing the USA and Russian spacecraft. Bond sends Kissy back to find Tiger and his men, while Bond himself sneaks into the crater.Inside the volcano, Bond locates the missing astro- and cosmonauts being held prisoner. They subdue a few guards and imprison the astronauts that are next to fly into space and capture the next spacecraft launched by the USA. Bond takes the place of one of them, in the hopes that can sabotage the next capture, however, as he prepares to enter the rogue rocket, he's stopped at the last moment and taken to the volcano's command center. There he meets the mysterious villain; Ernst Stavro Blofeld, leader of SPECTRE, a vast criminal organization. Bond's personal effects are confiscated and Blofeld reveals his plan; the capture of both American and Russian spacecraft will trigger a nuclear war between the two, eliminating them from the world stage. Presumably China would move in and seize control of the world from the two superpowers. As Blofeld's craft moves into position, Tiger's ninja army arrives at the crater, but are detected and fired upon by the sentry guns there. Seemingly helpless watching his allies' fate, Bond asks for one of his cigarettes, one of the weaponized ones given to him by Tiger. He kills one of Blofeld's men with the miniature rocket inside and opens the main crater hatch, allowing Tiger's men to storm the base. A fierce battle erupts. Bond and Tiger's men eventually gain the upper hand in battle. Bond finds a way into the control room through Blofeld's private quarters. There, Bond battles briefly with Hans until the henchman is thrown into his boss' pool of piranha. Bond reaches the control room and struggles briefly with the detonator for Blofeld's spacecraft until he is able to destroy the craft. Relieved, the POTUS calls off the nuclear run. Blofeld himself escapes after killing Osato and triggers a self-destruct device that cause the volcano to erupt. Tiger, Bond, Kissy and the ninja army escape into the sea.Bond and Kissy find a life raft waiting nearby and board it. Bond asks Kissy if it's OK to take their ""honeymoon"" now and she agrees. As they kiss, a British sub surfaces underneath them and the raft is caught on the fore section of the sub. Inside, M orders Moneypenny to tell Bond to report.","
    
                    When an American space capsule is swallowed up by what they believe to be a Russian spaceship, World War 3 nearly breaks out. The British Government, however, suspect that other powers are at work as the space craft went down near Japan. S.P.E.C.T.R.E. is the force behind the theft, as James Bond discovers, but its motives are far from clear, and he must first find out where the captured space capsule is held before America and Russia initiate another world war.

                    After a mysterious rocket ship seizes manned space missions from Earth's orbit, suspicions mount and the world superpowers are hurled to the brink of war. Their only hope rests with James Bond, who races to stop the space-jackings' true mastermind, Ernst Blofeld. Chief of the evil SPECTRE organization, Blofeld is bent on instigating global warfare from his massive headquarters nestled in an inactive volcano.

                    During a routine US space mission a manned American rocket mysteriously disappears while in orbit. The Americans naturally suspect the Soviets and threaten retaliation. However, the British are more cautious after one of their tracking stations indicates that the space craft may have come down near the Sea of Japan. James Bond is sent to investigate, but when the Soviets lose one of their space craft in similar circumstances, 007 has only a few days to locate the launch site and prevent the outbreak of World War III.

                    In 1967 the US and Soviet Russia reach a new crisis when Jupiter 16, a US space capsule, is captured in Earth orbit by a strange rocket ship. The US accuses the Soviets of the space hijacking, even though Great Britain believes the alien ship landed in the Sea Of Japan. Her Majesty's Secret Service now swings into action by ""killing"" James Bond in Hong Kong - a ruse so Bond can move about Japan unmolested by his enemies. Working with, and enjoying the exotic hospitality of, Japanese SIS and its commander ""Tiger"" Tanaka, James uncovers evidence that a major chemical company is smuggling liquid oxygen for rocket fuel, and his and Tanaka's investigation leads to an extinct volcano that is the source of the space hijacking - just as a Soviet spacecraft is grabbed by the alien rocket and a previously scheduled US launch is pushed upward with America's strategic forces on full battle alert, forcing James and Tanaka to confront the true source of the space hijackings - SPECTRE, and its ruthless leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

    Synopsis
    Orbiting over the Earth is Jupiter 16, a US space capsule manned by two astronauts. As they maintain radio contact with bases in Hawaii and Houston, one of the astronauts ventures outside to make routine repairs, when radar picks up another spacecraft closing fast. Radio contact is lost and the spacecraft opens up and swallows Jupiter 16, in the process severing the other astronaut's lifeline and leaving him to die in space.In Hong Kong, James Bond is enjoying a romantic encounter with a Chinese woman. She leaves the bed a pushes a button that levers it into the wall. Two men burst into the room with machine guns and spray the bed. When the police arrive, the woman has disappeared and Bond is found dead.A contentious meeting between US and Russian diplomats follows, brokered by a member of Britain's foreign service. The US believes the pirate spacecraft is Russian in origin, having tracked the ship in orbit before it ventured into the atmosphere; the US is to launch another capsule in three weeks and will regard interference with the ship as an act of war, and will launch a military attack on Russia should the capsule come under attack itself. Great Britain, however, believes the alien ship landed in the Sea of Japan based on tracking of the ship from a station in Singapore, and that a British official in Hong Kong is following this lead.MI6's best agent, James Bond, is ordered to investigate. His assassination in Hong Kong was a ruse to trick his enemies into believing he was dead so he can continue his mission undetected. He is ordered to Japan to meet with members of Japan's SIS. One, a beautiful woman named Aki, takes him to the home of Dikko Henderson, a British intelligence official living in Japan who has discovered information about the rogue spacecraft. Henderson theorizes that a third power is using Osato Chemicals, a vast multinational corporation, to launch spacecraft from Japan to attack US and Russian spacecrafts and trigger war between the two superpowers. However, Henderson is stabbed to death before he can reveal more. James subdues Henderson's killer, then takes his place and infiltrates Osato Chemicals to find more information. He battles with a large bodyguard and defeats him before he finds a safe containing paperwork and a film negative that he takes before being pursued by security guards.James is rescued by Aki, but he is now mistrustful. When Aki stops her car near a subway entrance James chases her, only to fall into a ""trap"" set by ""Tiger"" Tanaka, the head of Japanese SIS and the most secretive official in Tokyo. After verifying Tanaka's credentials via a codeword, James works with him and they examine the paperwork found in Osato's safe. It details the smuggling of LOX - technical shorthand for liquid oxygen for rocket fuel and which is also the name for smoked salmon, and the perfect cover. The film negative is of a supertanker, the Ning Po, the picture coming from an American tourist killed by whoever works for Osato Chemicals; the picture shows not only the ship but a small boat of fishing women, indicating the area is an outer island on the way to Shanghai. James theorizes that the international criminal consortium SPECTRE has a role in the space hijackings given their history of using private organizations for the actual legwork of a conspiracy in the service of other foreign powers.James spends the night at Tanaka's house, where he is given exotic hospitality in the form of being bathed by ""very sexiful"" young ladies and given a relaxing massage by one. James' massage is taken over by the shapely and scantily-dressed Aki, who has fallen in love with him, a love the two consummate.The next day James is arranged to meet with Mr. Osato in the guise of businessman Jim Fisher to negotiate a bulk-purchase of important chemicals. Osato surreptitiously X-rays James, finding he is armed, and James is given a drink by Osato's secretary, Helga Brandt, who is more than just an efficient aide-de-camp. Osato orders hitmen to kill James, but he and Aki escape and Tanaka dispatches the hitmen via a transport chopper sporting a giant magnet.Tanaka radios James and orders James and Aki to Kobe, where the Ning Po is being loaded for departure. James then urges Tanaka to contact M in London to dispatch ""Little Nellie"" and her father - a minicopter gunship built under the supervision of Major Geoffrey ""Q"" Boothroyd. After arriving at Kobe, James and Aki find tanks of liquid oxygen but the two are attacked by a gang of dockworkers. James fights them off to allow Aki to escape, and it appears James himself will get away - until he is ambushed and knocked unconscious.He is bound to a chair in Helga's room on the Ning Po, where she questions him about snooping around the dock and holds a plastic surgeon's instrument dangerously close to James to pry information from him. But she is also aroused by James' masculinity and allows herself to be seduced by him; after consummating their arousal she flies James in a private plane, then bails out and locks him in, but James manages to escape, land the crippled plane, and escape before it explodes.Returning to Tiger's house, James is given photos of the Ning Po showing she stopped at an outer island and offloaded an enormous stockpile of equipment, shown by a vastly lower waterline. The threesome meet ""Q"" and Little Nellie is assembled by Q's crew of specialists. Sporting a variety of powerful weapons aboard Little Nellie, James overflies the area islands and is attacked by four gunships which he shoots down and which leave no doubt as to the presence of SPECTRE.A scheduled Russian space shot, meanwhile, goes off, and is grabbed by the enemy rocket, which is tracked by the US Air Force before disappearing, seeming to confirm to the US that the Russians are behind the space hijackings and will now use the excuse of losing their own spacecraft to shoot down the next Jupiter launch.Both Osato and Helga Brandt meet with their leader in his headquarters after the rogue craft returns to it's base. The man's face is not shown however he holds a white cat and finishes a meeting with two scientists who designed the radar jamming system that has cloaked the location of the villain's base. Both men demand more money but acquiesce after his bodyguard, Hans, shows them his leader's pool of piranha. The two scientists leave and the mysterious villain flashes the x-ray showing Bond's Walther PPK and expresses his disappointment in both Osato and Brandt for failing to kill him. Both accuse each other of failure. The villain orders Brandt to leave and drops her into the piranha pool as she walks across its bridge; she is eaten alive. He then sharply orders Osato to kill Bond immediately.Bond is ordered to report to Tiger's palatial estate which also doubles as a ninja training camp. Tiger's plan is to use his army of men to infiltrate a fishing village on the island where the Ning Po last made port. Bond himself will be disguised as a Japanese man and will train with the rest of Tiger's ninja army; the army will later hide in the island's largest village as local fishermen. Bond will also take a wife; to his dismay, Aki will not be the woman because she is not from the village. After the procedure which disguises him, Bond and Aki spend the night together. While they sleep, an assassin sneaks into the rafters above their bed and lowers a needle on the end of a thread. He trickles a powerful poison down the thread, his target being Bond. Bond, however, shifts in his sleep. Aki also shifts at the same moment and the poison drips onto her mouth. As she struggles and dies, Bond wakes up and shoots the assassin dead. Tiger comes in and Bond tells him what happened. Bond seems more urgent than ever to investigate the plot but Tiger tells him he needs a few more days of training. The next day during a staff match, Bond is attacked again by another assassin who tries to stab him with a knife hidden in his weapon. Bond kills the man and Tiger identifies him, saying he's not one of his men. The next day Bond is wed to a lovely young woman from the fishing village, Kissy. The settle into a small house in the village and Kissy rejects Bond's advances to consummate their marriage. The two also notice a small funeral being held for a young girl who'd been exploring a nearby cave along the shoreline. When the girl's boat floated out of the cave, she was mysteriously dead. At early morning, Tiger warns Bond that the Americans are launching their next spacecraft today with a last warning to the Soviets! Bond becomes interested in the cave; the next morning, he and Kissy drift away from the fishing fleet and explore the cave. When they enter it, Bond immediately notices that a poison gas has been released in the cave and they jump over the side of their boat and swim inside. The come ashore and hike up to the volcano's caldera. They see a helicopter fly down into the basin but it disappears. A closer investigation reveals that the surface of the crater's lake is actually a gigantic metal cover that hides a secret base where the rogue rocket has been hiding after swallowing the USA and Russian spacecraft. Bond sends Kissy back to find Tiger and his men, while Bond himself sneaks into the crater.Inside the volcano, Bond locates the missing astro- and cosmonauts being held prisoner. They subdue a few guards and imprison the astronauts that are next to fly into space and capture the next spacecraft launched by the USA. Bond takes the place of one of them, in the hopes that can sabotage the next capture, however, as he prepares to enter the rogue rocket, he's stopped at the last moment and taken to the volcano's command center. There he meets the mysterious villain; Ernst Stavro Blofeld, leader of SPECTRE, a vast criminal organization. Bond's personal effects are confiscated and Blofeld reveals his plan; the capture of both American and Russian spacecraft will trigger a nuclear war between the two, eliminating them from the world stage. Presumably China would move in and seize control of the world from the two superpowers. As Blofeld's craft moves into position, Tiger's ninja army arrives at the crater, but are detected and fired upon by the sentry guns there. Seemingly helpless watching his allies' fate, Bond asks for one of his cigarettes, one of the weaponized ones given to him by Tiger. He kills one of Blofeld's men with the miniature rocket inside and opens the main crater hatch, allowing Tiger's men to storm the base. A fierce battle erupts. Bond and Tiger's men eventually gain the upper hand in battle. Bond finds a way into the control room through Blofeld's private quarters. There, Bond battles briefly with Hans until the henchman is thrown into his boss' pool of piranha. Bond reaches the control room and struggles briefly with the detonator for Blofeld's spacecraft until he is able to destroy the craft. Relieved, the POTUS calls off the nuclear run. Blofeld himself escapes after killing Osato and triggers a self-destruct device that cause the volcano to erupt. Tiger, Bond, Kissy and the ninja army escape into the sea.Bond and Kissy find a life raft waiting nearby and board it. Bond asks Kissy if it's OK to take their ""honeymoon"" now and she agrees. As they kiss, a British sub surfaces underneath them and the raft is caught on the fore section of the sub. Inside, M orders Moneypenny to tell Bond to report.

Their liberal persuasions are now put to the test, for although the young man is an ideal choice (he's highly and internationally respected in the medical field, and he's impeccably mannered, handsome, well dressed and of a respectable California family), he's black. The film, which covers one busy day in the Drayton home, is essentially a drawing-room comedy, a series of cross-conversations between the young doctor and the girl's parents, and finally between all sets of parents and offspring. A simple dinner is extended to include the doctor's parents, who fly up from Los Angeles for the evening, and the crusty but benevolent old Irish priest, a friend of the family. Thus, the title of the film . . .

They are outwardly in a loving, happy marriage, which belies the fact that she more often than not rejects his romantic and sexual advances in the bedroom. He tolerates her rejections in his love for her. Although she tells him of the benign situations of her many dreams, she doesn't tell him of the details, which always include he controlling and humiliating her in some form of sexual dominance. She does not know why she rejects him sexually, or why she has such dreams. She learns from various sources that one of her distant married friends, a woman by the name of Henrietta, works as a prostitute in a high end brothel, which she didn't know even existed. Although initially uncomfortable with both the thought and the actual actions of having sex with strange men for money, Séverine is nonetheless drawn to work in such an establishment. In doing so, Séverine may be able to exorcise some demons in her life, but perhaps not at others' expense in the process.

As Lisa leaves the apartment with the doll, we see the man watching her leave, then dialing someone on the phone. Lisa takes the doll with her on a flight to New York City, but when, on disembarking, she sees a man watching her, she becomes worried and gives the doll for safekeeping to fellow passenger photographer Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.). The man who'd been watching Lisa then roughly escorts her away. Later, when Lisa calls Sam to ask for the doll, Sam and his wife are unable to find it.Some time afterward, small-time con artist Mike Talman (Richard Crenna) and his partner Carlino (Jack Weston) arrive at the basement apartment where Sam lives with his blind wife, Susy (Audrey Hepburn). The two men watch until both the apartment's occupants have left, then enter. They have an appointment with Lisa, who'd been their partner in crime prior to the recent imprisonment of both, but they are met instead by Harry Roat, Jr. (Alan Arkin), whom the audience recognizes as the man who watched and met Lisa at the airport. He offers them $2,000 each if they find Lisa's doll, which is somewhere in the apartment.After discovering Lisa's dead body hanging in a garment bag, Talman and Carlino want to make a quick exit, but Roat points out that they have left their fingerprints all over the apartment, while he has worn gloves. Roat is then able to prevail upon the two to help him dispose of Lisa's body (he claims that he killed her because he caught her going into business for herself). Roat orders Talman and Carlino to help him try to find the heroin-stuffed doll.The next day, Susy's neighbor leaves for the weekend, and Sam leaves on a business trip. Once Susy is alone, the criminals begin an elaborate con game: In order to gain entry into the apartment, Talman arrives posing as a friend of Sam's, Carlino poses as a police officer, and Roat poses first as an old man and then as the man's son. Using first an innocuous story about Sam and the doll, then a darker one implying that Lisa has been murdered and that Sam will be suspected, the men persuade Susy to help them find the doll. Talman gives her the number of the phone booth across the street as his own after falsely warning her of a police car stationed outside.Susy meanwhile has grown suspicious of Carlino and Roat, and Gloria (Julie Herrod), a neighbor who is paid by Susy to help her with errands, has been going in and out of the apartment, sometimes without Susy's noticing. After Talman leaves, Gloria sneaks into the apartment carrying the doll, which she stole earlier. She tells Susy there is no police car outside, and Susy discovers the doll. Wanting to confirm her suspicions about Carlino and Roat, Susy tells Gloria to go home and watch the phone booth that is next to Roat's van parked outside. If a man goes into it, Gloria is to phone Susy, let the phone ring twice, and hang up. Gloria tells Susy she can signal her by banging on the pipes.On Carlino's next visit, after he calls Roat at the phone booth, Gloria sends Susy the telephone signal, and she sends the signal a second time after Susy calls Talman to tell him she has the doll. Finally realizing that Talman is a criminal in cahoots with the two others, Susy hides the doll. When he walks in with Corlino and Roat following quietly, she tells him the doll is at Sam's studio. The three criminals leave after Roat cuts the telephone cord.When Susy bangs on the pipes, Gloria comes in and Susy sends her to the bus station in a taxi to wait for Sam. When Susy discovers that the telephone cord has been cut, she prepares to defend herself by putting the criminals in the dark along with her, breaking all the light bulbs in the apartment's light fixtures. She also pours a chemical into a bowl.When Talman returns, she refuses to cooperate when he demands that she hand over the doll. Talman has spent the most time with Susy and he has come to admire her for her quiet strength and ability to stand up to the three criminals despite her disability. He admits to her that he and his confederates are part of a criminal plot and that Sam, as Susy suspected, is completely innocent of any involvement, while Roat is a particular danger. Susy needn't worry, though, Talman says, as he has sent Carlino to kill Roat.However, having anticipated that the others would turn on him, Roat has instead killed Carlino by running him over. As Talman prepares to leave, pausing to say something to Susy as he stands in the doorway, Roat suddenly appears and stabs him in the back.Intent on acquiring the doll, Roat chains the door shut in the dark apartment, pours gasoline on the floor, and sets a piece of newspaper on fire. A desperate battle follows in which Susy throws the chemical solution in Roat's face and forces him to put out the fire as well as smashes the last lightbulb in the apartment. The battle ends when Roat obtains light by opening the refrigerator, whose door he props open with a rag in the hinge. Susy, weeping (because she forgot about the refrigerator light), pulls the doll out of its hiding place and hands it to Roat. While Roat cuts open the doll and gloats over the treasure inside, Susy is able, unnoticed by him, to arm herself with a butcher knife.Roat then announces his intention to rape Susy, but, as he leads her to the bedroom, she manages to stab him in the belly. As she stumbles across the floor toward the kitchen window to scream for help, Roat leaps out from the darkened bedroom and grabs her ankle. Screaming, Susy wrenches free, but the dying Roat doggedly pursues her, using the knife with which she stabbed him to drag himself across the floor. Susy is at the refrigerator, trying to close its door and thus extinguish its light, unaware of the rag that is preventing its closure. She then gropes for the refrigerator's cord, murmuring desperately, ""Where is it?"" As the reeling Roat stands with his last strength and staggers toward her with the knife, the refrigerator light finally goes out, and Susy's scream merges with the sound of a police siren.The scene switches to the arrival of police cars outside the apartment. When the police enter with Sam and Gloria, Sam finds an unbroken light bulb, and we see the room littered with the bodies of Talman and Roat, but no Susy. Finally, as Sam calls out for her, the door of the unplugged refrigerator moves, and Susy emerges from behind it, shaken but alive.","
    
                    Susy was recently blinded and recently married. Susy's husband, Sam, is asked to hold a doll for a woman he doesn't know as they get off an airplane. The woman disappears. Later, she's found dead by her former associates, Mike and Carlino, small-time hoods, in Susy's basement apartment. (Both occupants of the apartment are then absent.) The doll woman's newer partner in crime, Harry Rote, who murdered her for self-dealing, presses Mike and Carlino into a scheme to recover the doll, which contains a fortune in smuggled heroin. After disposing of the body, the thugs return while Susy is present to continue their search. They assume Susy's blindness will enable them to search her apartment under her very nose for the doll. In Sam's absence, Mike pretends to be an old friend of Sam's, while the three together spin for Susy a story of a murder investigation of her husband from which only the finding of the missing doll can save him. Rote is a predator, and his stalking of Susy becomes ever more obvious as the blind woman's predicament becomes ever more desperate.

However, Sam misplaces the doll once he gets home. That adversary, a sadistic criminal named Harry Roat, using an argument they can't refuse, convinces two of Lisa's just released from prison associates, Mike Talman and Carlino, to assist him in retrieving the doll from Sam's Greenwich Village apartment, them without even knowing what's inside, or without any of the three knowing that Hendrix has no idea where the doll is anymore. Roat, Talman and Carlino believe their task is all the more easy when they learn that Sam's wife, Susy Hendrix, is blind. As Susy is still adjusting to her recent blindness, Sam does whatever he can to make her as self-sufficient as possible, which she often still resents. They concoct a seemingly innocuous plan to infiltrate Susy's life while Sam is conveniently sent out of town on business. If the plan goes awry at any point, Susy would have no idea that her life would be in danger. What Roat, Talman and Carlino may be unaware of is that Susy does have eyes in the form of the Hendrix's precocious adolescent neighbor, Gloria, who knows more about the missing doll than she initially lets on, and that Susy may have certain advantages in life due to her blindness.

Gloria tells Susy she can signal her by banging on the pipes.On Carlino's next visit, after he calls Roat at the phone booth, Gloria sends Susy the telephone signal, and she sends the signal a second time after Susy calls Talman to tell him she has the doll. Finally realizing that Talman is a criminal in cahoots with the two others, Susy hides the doll. When he walks in with Corlino and Roat following quietly, she tells him the doll is at Sam's studio. The three criminals leave after Roat cuts the telephone cord.When Susy bangs on the pipes, Gloria comes in and Susy sends her to the bus station in a taxi to wait for Sam. When Susy discovers that the telephone cord has been cut, she prepares to defend herself by putting the criminals in the dark along with her, breaking all the light bulbs in the apartment's light fixtures. She also pours a chemical into a bowl.When Talman returns, she refuses to cooperate when he demands that she hand over the doll. Talman has spent the most time with Susy and he has come to admire her for her quiet strength and ability to stand up to the three criminals despite her disability. He admits to her that he and his confederates are part of a criminal plot and that Sam, as Susy suspected, is completely innocent of any involvement, while Roat is a particular danger. Susy needn't worry, though, Talman says, as he has sent Carlino to kill Roat.However, having anticipated that the others would turn on him, Roat has instead killed Carlino by running him over. As Talman prepares to leave, pausing to say something to Susy as he stands in the doorway, Roat suddenly appears and stabs him in the back.Intent on acquiring the doll, Roat chains the door shut in the dark apartment, pours gasoline on the floor, and sets a piece of newspaper on fire. A desperate battle follows in which Susy throws the chemical solution in Roat's face and forces him to put out the fire as well as smashes the last lightbulb in the apartment. The battle ends when Roat obtains light by opening the refrigerator, whose door he props open with a rag in the hinge. Susy, weeping (because she forgot about the refrigerator light), pulls the doll out of its hiding place and hands it to Roat. While Roat cuts open the doll and gloats over the treasure inside, Susy is able, unnoticed by him, to arm herself with a butcher knife.Roat then announces his intention to rape Susy, but, as he leads her to the bedroom, she manages to stab him in the belly. As she stumbles across the floor toward the kitchen window to scream for help, Roat leaps out from the darkened bedroom and grabs her ankle. Screaming, Susy wrenches free, but the dying Roat doggedly pursues her, using the knife with which she stabbed him to drag himself across the floor. Susy is at the refrigerator, trying to close its door and thus extinguish its light, unaware of the rag that is preventing its closure. She then gropes for the refrigerator's cord, murmuring desperately, ""Where is it?"" As the reeling Roat stands with his last strength and staggers toward her with the knife, the refrigerator light finally goes out, and Susy's scream merges with the sound of a police siren.The scene switches to the arrival of police cars outside the apartment. When the police enter with Sam and Gloria, Sam finds an unbroken light bulb, and we see the room littered with the bodies of Talman and Roat, but no Susy. Finally, as Sam calls out for her, the door of the unplugged refrigerator moves, and Susy emerges from behind it, shaken but alive.

"14","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061452/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Casino Royale (1967)Sir James Bond (David Niven) retired at the height of his powers when forced to betray his lover Mata Hari, and now lives in an English country house, surrounded by lions, devoting himself to Debussy and cultivating black roses, attended by his butler (Erik Chitty). However, alarmed by the mounting losses of their spies, he is visited by the heads of the British ('M' or McTarry; John Huston), French (LeGrand; Charles Boyer), American (Ransome; William Holden) and Russian (Smernov; Kurt Kasznar) Secret Services (collectively driven by M's chauffer John LeMesurier), who petition him to return. He refuses, considering himself to belong to a nobler tradition, and them all gadget-ridden ""jokeshop"" spies, and deploring the handing on of his legend, name and number to a ""sexual acrobat"". Even a letter from the Queen does not sway him, and as a final desperate trick M signals for Sir James' home to be blown up by the Army: the attack also kills M (but not, apparently, the others).Smersh Authority (the villains) learns that ""Sir James Bond is back, with his morals, his vows and his celibate image. We must destroy that image"".Sir James, thus forced out of retirement, travels to Scotland, taking M's toupee (the only surviving relic or heirloom) to M's widow, Lady Fiona, who has been substituted by Smersh agent Mimi (Deborah Kerr). She explains the rituals surrounding the death of The McTarry, which include a banquet (with fresh goat haggis and lots of whisky), dancing, and a memorial grouse shoot (""Whenever a McTarry dies, the grouse come into season""). The castle is filled with beautiful girls, agents of Smersh, pretending to be M's eleven 16-19-year-old daughters (""some of us are adopted"") including Heather (Tracey Crisp) and Meg (Alexandra Bastedo), who undress Sir James for his bath (""be careful, that's my loose kneecap""), Buttercup (""Daddy's little thermometer"", Angela Scoular) whom Sir James discovers actually in his bath, as well as Eliza (Gabriella Licudi), Peg (Elaine Taylor), and Michele (Frances Cosslett).Sir James drinks all the others under the table at the banquet, but when later approached by Mimi in his bedroom claiming he ""comfort her"" as her ""widow's due"", upon rejecting her, she calls him a ""ninnogaywillycouf"" and summons the pipers for a 'worzle', a contest which involves picking up and attempting to throw large stone cannonballs. This he wins, largely as the five pipers (Robin, Jock, Sandy: Bob Godfrey, Percy Herbert) injure themselves in trying to pick up the balls, whereas he manages to pick one up, throw it and catch it. Mimi is so impressed the other girls decide she is a risk and lock her in her room.At the grouse shoot, one of Sir James' cape buttons has been substituted with a homing beacon, and the girls send rocket-launched explosive-laden dummy grouse towards him. Assisted by Mimi, who has escaped down the rather unsafe drainpipe from her room, Sir James uses his braces to fire the button back into the rocket launcher, blowing it up. Mimi, injured, wins a farewell kiss from Sir James (""Madam, are you quite sure you're dying?"") before entering a convent, and tells him that their orders came from ""Authority: International Mothers' Help, East Berlin"" (1).Driving back from Scotland, Sir James is trailed by a remote-controlled booby-trapped milk float (control girl Penny Riley), but manages to escape so that it kills yet another Smersh agent (). In London, he takes over as head of the British Secret Service, whose only surviving members are his secretary Miss Moneypenny (or rather her daughter; Barbara Bouchet), and his assistant Hadley (or rather his son; Derek Nimmo), who explain that all the secret agents apart from Sir James' replacement (now doing television) have been killed in sexually suggestive situations (""stabbed to death in a ladies sauna bath"", ""burnt in a blazing bordello"", ""garrotted in a geisha house"", etc.) with the possible exception of Sir James' nephew, Jimmy Bond (Woody Allen), last seen in the Caribbean escaping a firing squad (""I have a very low threshold of death"") with an exploding cigarette, only to end up in front of another firing squad. Sir James decides to call up all the auxiliary staff, and to create the ultimate 'Anti-Female Spy Device' - a man whom all women desire, but who is indifferent to them. Miss Moneypenny is tasked with finding one such (""your mother did some of her best work at night""), and she finds Cooper ('Coop': Terence Cooper: ""Sounds like something for keeping birds."" ""That's me""). Coop, a holder of the 'Kama Sutra Black Belt', is then sent for his anti-female training, against a gym-full of a variety of exotic, exotically dressed Bond girls (Yvonne Marsh, Veronica Gardnier - there are over 200 beautiful girls in the film), overcoming them all but eventually meeting new secret weapon The Detainer (Daliah Lavi), who also becomes 007 (""I don't do anything, but, unless you're one of them, you do""), Sir James having decided that to create confusion all agents, both male and female, will become 'James Bond, 007'.Sir James personally recruits two new 007 spies. The first is wealthy Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress: assistant Valentine Dyall), who Sir James persuades using a £5m tax arrears demand (2). Vesper is given the task of approaching and recruiting Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers: ""Isn't Evelyn a girl's name? No, its mine""), an expert in baccarat at the Buckingham Club, whom Sir James wants to use to defeat Smersh's treasurer, Le Chiffre (Orson Welles), currently gambling with Smersh's money at Casino Royale. She does this, seducing Tremble at her Mayfair flat (to which she has lately had Nelson's Column removed) and also encouraging him to dress up in a number of costumes (including Napoleon - complete with 'Sunny Elba' pamphlet - Hitler and Toulouse-Lautrec: ""Come on, you have more to do"". ""More?!""). Tremble, now also James Bond, 007, goes to Q (Geoffrey Bayldon) and his fey assistant Fordyce (John Wells) in their cellars full of inept inventions (where he is also shadowed by a dwarf dressed as a garden gnome ""He's our security man"") for his fitting with a gadget-filled suit (""a little bit tight about the..."" ""Poison capsule compartment?"").Sir James then recruits his own daughter by Mata Hari, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet), currently working as a living Eastern goddess (""Celestial Virgin of the Sacred Altar"" ""Figuratively speaking, of course"": temple guard Milton Reid, monk John Hollis): there is a superb temple dance sequence. Mata Bond is sent to West Berlin by London taxicab (taxicab driver Bernard Cribbins) to infiltrate International Mothers' Help, known to be a Smersh cover for the Mata Hari School of Dancing, a spy training school, with rather complex neo-Cubist décor, presided over by the formidable Frau Hoffner (Anna Quale) and the diminutive Polo (Ronnie Corbett). Revealing her identity as Mata Hari's daughter, she is shown by Polo to her mother's old room (""What an enormous bed!"" ""The German army was very large in those days""), where she discovers a secret passageway activated by the cistern, which leads to a projection suite: she also discovers 'little Otto' one of her mother's lovers (""Is he dead?"" ""Hard to tell. He always looked like that""). She learns that Le Chiffre is, via his agent (Vladek Sheybal) auctioning his art collection of blackmail photographs to raise money: the auction in the auditorium is attended by officers from the British (Jack Gwilliam, Richard Wattis), Chinese (Burt Kwouk), American (Hal Galili) and Russian armies. Warned by the taxi-driver (revealed as Carlton-Towers of the Foreign Office) to prevent Le Chiffre raising the money, as the bidding for the first lot escalates (""Seventy million tons of rice!"" ""Sixty tons of caviar!""), Mata returns to the projection room, seizes the case of projector slides and flushes them away: she then escapes Polo by unplugging his external heart battery, Frau Hoffner is shot by Otto, and Mata, using a foam fire-extinguisher on the assorted military, makes good her escape with Carlton-Towers (first trying a drain, but on hearing 'What's New, Pussycat', by taxi back to London). Le Chiffre's agent, telephoning him to report his failure, and that Smersh's leader Dr. Noah now knows what Le Chiffre has been up to, is blown up in his telephone box (the explosion also destroys part of the Berlin Wall).Tremble now travels to Casino Royale, where after meeting Matthis, a French inspector of police (with an improbable Scots accent; Duncan Macrae (3)) , and having a car-wash with many eavesdroppers (yet more beautiful girls), in his room meets Miss Goodthighs (Jacqueline Bisset) ""the management of the Hotel Tropical present their compliments"" who attempts to drug him with doped champagne. Vesper arrives, 'takes care of' Miss Goodthighs, and rouses Tremble.Vesper and Tremble go the Casino: they deposit £100,000 (cashier Graham Stark) and then meet the casino director Slimmington-Jones (Colin Gordon) in his office. Tremble spots that Le Chiffre is using infra-red spectacles to cheat: Vesper steals these: Le Chiffre shows off with some magic (assistants Jennifer Baker, Susan Baker), and then Tremble and Le Chiffre play a very-high-stakes baccarat game (50 million francs: ~£3.6m or $10m at the time), which Tremble ultimately wins. Tremble takes his winnings as a cheque drawn on a Swiss bank.On the way out of the Casino, Vesper is kidnapped: Tremble, advised of this by the doorman (John Bluthal) follows in a racing car (the racing car driver Sterling Moss, as himself, having run off) but is also captured by Le Chiffre, who wants the cheque. Placed in a very elaborate but broken chair in Le Chiffre's dungeon, he suffers torture - not physical, but mental - eventually becoming a Scot in full Highland costume attacked by four Scots marching bands (including Peter O'Toole), he is rescued by Vesper using a machine gun disguised as bagpipes, who then, however, betrays and kills him (and presumably takes the cheque: ""Never trust a rich spy'). Le Chiffre is then killed by Smersh agents sent by Dr. Noah.Back in London, Sir James goes to see the Prime Minister, leaving Mata to sight-see (""Mummy would have taken me in"" ""Mummy took everyone in""): she is captured by a Household Cavalry officer () on horseback and taken by flying saucer, which lands on the now-vacated site of Nelson's Column, to Casino Royale, where, it is now revealed, the secret headquarters of Smersh's leader Dr. Noah are located (announcer Valentine Dyall). Advised of this by former agent Mimi, now a nun collecting donations (""This department has always been very helpful to needy girls"") Sir James and Moneypenny follow to Casino Royale: attacked in the casino director's room (which is a lift connecting to Dr. Noah's HQ, activated by pushing the eye of a stuffed tiger) they eventually win through to an audience hall with chairs made of gold ingots to see Dr. Noah himself - who turns out to be Sir James' missing nephew, Jimmy Bond. Jimmy is however speechless in his uncle's presence: ""I never should have let Nellie send him to progressive school... I'm beginning to think you're a trifle neurotic"". Dr. Noah/Jimmy reveals part of his plans (using a taped message); to release a bacillus which will leave all women beautiful and all men shorter than himself; and then hits a gong to summon his staff and have Sir James and Moneypenny incarcerated.Dr. Noah then reveals to The Detainer, whom he has also captured, stripped and strapped down to a couch (""I learnt that in the Boy Scouts""), his desire to outshine his uncle, and the rest of his plans: to substitute robot doubles for all world leaders (some of which he has already done). He also shows her a pill he has invented, which ""looks like an aspirin, it tastes like an aspirin, but it is not an aspirin"" - it is in fact an atomic bomb, which goes off after 400 chain reactions. Feigning interest in him, she is released, steals the pill, and manages to slip it into his champagne, and he starts his hiccup-visualized countdown.Sir James, Mata, Moneypenny and Coop (captured earlier) now manage to escape the psychedelically-decorated room in which they have been imprisoned (using exploding 'vaporized lysergic acid' (4)), and making their way back to the audience hall (""Super place for a coming-out party"") and meeting up with The Detainer, find their way back to the Casino (with the aid of Frankenstein's monster: David Prowse). Whilst The Detainer escapes, Sir James tries to call London for aid, but is stopped by Vesper; ""Dear Vesper. The things you do for money"": who has, however, apparently fallen in love with him, and everything that has happened has been a plan to lure him to her at Casino Royale. He overpowers her, and then he and the remaining James Bonds initiate an attack on the Smersh agents in the Casino, aided by the French (Jean-Paul Belmondo: translates 'Merde!' as 'Ouch') and the Americans, both horse-riding Cowboys and tomahawk-wielding Red Indians (air-dropped with tepees as parachutes: Ransome reappears also): George Raft (as himself) shots himself during the affray, and the Keystone Cops have a cameo. Dr. Noah appears with the final chain-reaction countdown hiccups, and the Casino is explosively completely destroyed, killing all five remaining James Bonds (Sir James, Coop, Vesper, Mata, Moneypenny), as well as Dr. Noah/Jimmy Bond. The closing song explains that six James Bonds (including Tremble) go to ""a heavenly spot"", Jimmy to ""a place where it's terribly hot"").Notes:(1) For younger readers: During the Cold War, the city of Berlin was divided by the Berlin Wall (1961-1989) into West Berlin (under Allied control: the Wall surrounded this) and East Berlin (under Soviet control). One of the motifs of the film is that the International Mothers' Help building straddles the border, this being reflected in the interior décor and lighting, and a symbolic rope bisecting the auditorium.(2) In 1967, £5m was half of art auctioneers Christie's annual turnover. Nowadays (2009) it buys 10% of a Titian.(3) There is also a brief pre-credits scene where Tremble (as James Bond) and the Inspector meet in a pissoir(4) Lysergic acid is a precursor for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD - very Sixties). As its melting point is 240oC, and its (theoretical) vaporization point considerably higher (it degrades), a certain technical liberty is taken by considering it to be an explosive vapour collectable in a seat-cushion-cover in the film(Original version retained below - fades a bit to the end)Any movie directed by 5 different people is boundto be confusing. This is, off course, no exception.The movie starts off with James Bond (Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers)) meeting Lieutenant Mathis(Duncan Macrae) of the Special Police in a pissouir in Paris. After Bond checks Mathis' credentials, he follows him out.The credits roll.4 cars come in from different directions - a Citroen, a Cadilac, a Bently, and what appears to be something Russian. The 4 chaufers wait by their cars as the 4 passengers get into a Rolls Royce, driven by a fifth chaufer.Through conversations between M (McTarry (John Huston)), Ransome (William Holden), Le Grand (Charles Boyer), and Smernov (Kurt Kasznar), we learn that this is the home of the original James Bond. He is pure of mind and body. They property is protected by many lions.James is exercising as the gentlemen arrive. He has a stutter. He complains that the agent that replaced him as James Bond 007 is leaving a trail of dead women behind; that the new gadgets have taken the honour from the profession.He takes them outside to show them his black rose. Each spy head complains that they are losing agents at an alarming rate. They want James to come out of retirement to fix their shared problems.James interrupts them to play some Debussy. We learn that Bond retired because he had to lure his lover, Mata Hari, to her death. He returns from playing. M shows him a letter from the Queen. Still, he refuses the request to return to duty. M lights a cigar as a signal, and British troops bomb the property. His mansion is destroyed and M's toupee is blown off.Cut to a Smersh control room. We hear the head of Smersh (Authority) tell them that James Bond is back, with his morals, vows, and celebate image in tact. He tells them to initiate Plan B to attempt to destroy that image.We see James driving his Morgan (?) through the British countryside into Scotland. Various spys report his progress. We learn that he is heading for M's (McTarry's) castle. Plan B is in operation with Agent Mimi taking the place of M's widow (Lady Fiona) because she has the best Scot's accent.Sir James presents the remains of M to Lady Fiona (Deborah Kerr). They explain that they'd heard of the death from the Grey Piper. The room is full of women, mourning. They prepare a traditional hagis feast for midnight, where they will dance the traditional Scotish Fling and drink Ouskabar. It is explained (there's a lot of explaining going on, but it really doesn't help) that they drink until they drop in their tracks, then after an hour's rest, the piper awakes them for the morning grouse shoot.James is shown to his room, where Meg and Heather help him undress for his bath. The room is full of paintings of nude women. Meg and Heather tell him that they are 2 of M's 11 daughters - all between the ages of 16 and 19. As they walk down the hall to the bath, they walk past a series of bedrooms, each with a gorgeous girl peering out.James goes into the bath room and starts to undress, when he notices that 17 year old Buttercup is in the tub - testing the water temperature (""Daddy's little thermometer""). She invites him in to scrub his back. James has to turn on the cold water to avoid certain embarassment.Cut to James' room, where we see Meg and Heather swapping a button on his coat - but they are speaking French! We learn that the button is to be used only as a last resort - that Mimi's never failed before.At the hagis feast, everyone is drinking scotch. Two girls have their legs entwined with James at the table, as he listens to Mimi pass on some of the McTarry folklore. Everyone eventually passes out except James, who takes his cup and the scotch decanter up to his room.He's enjoying a nightcap as Mimi comes in and declares ""her Widow's Due"", insisting that James ""doodle her"". He refuses, so she insists that he ""pay the piper"". She blows a silly trumpet solo on a hunting horn, and calls the huge Scottish pipers in. They are going to ""wassle"" - play catch with heavy stone cannon balls.The first 5 do themselves in trying to lift and throw the balls. The sixth manages a throw that James catches and throws back. The piper catches the ball, but the weight forces him back, into an armour display, which falls on him and knocks him out. James then picks up the last wassle ball and karate chops it in 2. Mimi is stricken. She praises him in French, blowing her cover. The other girls realize, and lock Mimi in her room.The next morning, James is out for the grouse shoot. Mimi's locked in her room, and realizes that James is in trouble. The truck that brought the beaters is actually a launcher of exploding grouse. Mimi escapes by sliding down a drainpipe outside her window, and come to warn James that the button on his coat is actually a homing device. He shoots the grouse before they can get too close, and tells Mimi to take off his braces. They use them like a slingshot to fire the button back towards the beaters. The beaters use a garter belt to fling the homing button back. James grabs the return shot, and Mimi is able to fire it into the grouse launcher. Mimi is injured, and commits herself to a nunnery. She tells James that they are run by International Mother's Help in Berlin.James leaves the McTarry estate, but is followed by a woman driving an E-Type Jaguar. The women in the Smersh control room activate a rigged milk truck. Through some tricky driving, James gets in front of the Jag, and the milk truck loses its visual feed to Control. Control has to set the truck to automatic. James drives into his gated estate and gets the gate closed as the Jag spins into them. The milk truck plows into the Jag, and they both explode.James shows up at MI5, sees Moneypenny, and gives her a big kiss. Moneypenny enjoys it, but explains that she is actually Moneypenny's daughter. James is on a mission, and has lost his stammer. He meets Hadley, who is also the son of the original Hadley.Hadley goes over the state of MI5's agents. Most have been lured to their death by enemy women agents. The replacement James Bond has quit to ""do television"". James' nephew, Jimmy Bond was working as a spy in the Caribbean, but hasn't been heard from in a while. In a flashback, we see Jimmy (Woody Allen) about to face a firing squad. He escapes using an exploding cigarette.James assigns Moneypenny to find a replacement 007 agent that is desireable to women, but can be trained to resist them. She selects agent Cooper, and spends the night confirming that he is good with women. The next day, she is having trouble staying awake, but James likes Coopers credentials (6"" 2 1/2', 184 lbs, Kama Sutra Black Belt).James announces that all remaining agents and trainees will be known as ""James Bond 007"" to confuse the enemy.Cooper goes through his anti-female training, flipping off a girl dressed identically to Ursula Andres in Dr. No. The third girl appears later as Dr. Noah's prisoner.James shows up at the headquarters of Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress). We learn that she is the world's richest spy. She negotiates a trade of the Eiffel Tower for nuclear warheads, and purchases the Lord Nelson's statue. James requests her help in exchange for reducing a large writ for tax arears.Vesper approaches Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers) at the Buckingham Club. They come close to kissing, as Vesper suggestively tells him that she would like to go over some of the passeges in his book on winning at Baccarat. She has been reading it in her bed. She will send her car to bring him to her place.Evelyn arrives as Vesper is disposing of a body. In one of the best looking shots in the movie, they walk behind a huge aquarium - in slow motion - to ""The Look of Love"" song. Vesper is waiting for Evelyn on (in?) her sunken couch. Evelyn admires Lord Nelson's statue from her window. After some suggestive banter, we see Evelyn exercising in his pyjamas and Vesper wearing a nightgown. She films Evelyn dressing up as Hitler, Napolion (complete with a ""Sunny Elba"" brochure) and Toulouse-Lautrec. She requests his help in breaking La Chiffre, who likes to play high stakes Baccarat. Evelyn accepts, and agrees to become James Bond for the assignment.Evelyn shows up at the MI5 training facility, where we see frog-men firing bows and arrows and a drill sergent leading his men into an elevator.

                    An unofficial and secret cooperative of the heads of British/French/American/Soviet intelligence try to persuade the original Sir James Bond 007 - known to be the greatest spy in history - to come out of retirement to work on a specific case: discover and stop the unknown forces that are murdering their collective agents. The womanizer who took over Sir James' name and number - who Sir James detests as sullying that good name and number by relying too much on gadgetry to get the work done - has moved onto other things, and Sir James' nebbish nephew Jimmy Bond has proved to be a disappointment as a spy and a man, and thus are not candidates for the job. Sir James politely declines, until a specific incident not only brings him out of retirement, but places him in the top job at MI6. Sir James eventually learns that it is SMERSH who is behind the murders. As such, Sir James amasses a team of agents all who are to named James Bond 007 - even the women - to confuse SMERSH. Among the ranks of new James Bond 007's, each who his or own specific duty, are: Coop, who is irresistible to women but will be trained to deny those feelings in return, as it has been proved that the demise of most of the agents was due to falling prey to sex; the Detainer, a newly devised secret weapon in a truly feminine form; wealthy Vesper Lynd, a former agent whose main role is to be the recruiter and handler for the next Bond on the list; Evelyn Tremble, a baccarat master, who will challenge SMERSH's financial agent, Le Chiffre, to a game at Casino Royale, this the primary means SMERSH is financed; and Mata Bond, Sir James and Mata Hara's illegitimate daughter, a dancer who will infiltrate an au pair service in East Berlin known to be a front for SMERSH's training center for their young, female operatives. Even if all the James Bond 007's are able to carry out their roles successfully, Sir James and the team will still have to discover the mastermind within SMERSH and his/her specific motive for the agent murders.

                    Sir James Bond, a spy from the old school (a good spy is a pure spy) is called back to service by the death of ""M"" and the imminent collapse of civilization. The opposition tries to compromise him, but even as nubile young agents are thrown at him, he remains above it all. Going beyond parody to sillyness, every agent is renamed James Bond, 007 to confuse the enemy, including Woody Allen who plays, Little Jimmy Bond.

Bond is taken in by Agent Mimi (alias Lady Fiona McTarry) who immediately falls in love with him. Bond's illegitimate daughter, Mata Bond, whose mother was the late Mata Hari, is going to help out. The current agent using the Bond name, Cooper, has his hands full, despite his assistance by beautiful secretary, Moneypenny. 007's nephew Jimmy Bond is supposedly incompetent. Bond, hoping to clear his name from its current low repute, hires Evelyn Tremble to meet LeChiffre at the gambling tables at Casino Royale. The world's richest agent, Vesper Lynd, helps convince Tremble to masquerade as 007.

    Synopsis
    Casino Royale (1967)Sir James Bond (David Niven) retired at the height of his powers when forced to betray his lover Mata Hari, and now lives in an English country house, surrounded by lions, devoting himself to Debussy and cultivating black roses, attended by his butler (Erik Chitty). However, alarmed by the mounting losses of their spies, he is visited by the heads of the British ('M' or McTarry; John Huston), French (LeGrand; Charles Boyer), American (Ransome; William Holden) and Russian (Smernov; Kurt Kasznar) Secret Services (collectively driven by M's chauffer John LeMesurier), who petition him to return. He refuses, considering himself to belong to a nobler tradition, and them all gadget-ridden ""jokeshop"" spies, and deploring the handing on of his legend, name and number to a ""sexual acrobat"". Even a letter from the Queen does not sway him, and as a final desperate trick M signals for Sir James' home to be blown up by the Army: the attack also kills M (but not, apparently, the others).Smersh Authority (the villains) learns that ""Sir James Bond is back, with his morals, his vows and his celibate image. We must destroy that image"".Sir James, thus forced out of retirement, travels to Scotland, taking M's toupee (the only surviving relic or heirloom) to M's widow, Lady Fiona, who has been substituted by Smersh agent Mimi (Deborah Kerr). She explains the rituals surrounding the death of The McTarry, which include a banquet (with fresh goat haggis and lots of whisky), dancing, and a memorial grouse shoot (""Whenever a McTarry dies, the grouse come into season""). The castle is filled with beautiful girls, agents of Smersh, pretending to be M's eleven 16-19-year-old daughters (""some of us are adopted"") including Heather (Tracey Crisp) and Meg (Alexandra Bastedo), who undress Sir James for his bath (""be careful, that's my loose kneecap""), Buttercup (""Daddy's little thermometer"", Angela Scoular) whom Sir James discovers actually in his bath, as well as Eliza (Gabriella Licudi), Peg (Elaine Taylor), and Michele (Frances Cosslett).Sir James drinks all the others under the table at the banquet, but when later approached by Mimi in his bedroom claiming he ""comfort her"" as her ""widow's due"", upon rejecting her, she calls him a ""ninnogaywillycouf"" and summons the pipers for a 'worzle', a contest which involves picking up and attempting to throw large stone cannonballs. This he wins, largely as the five pipers (Robin, Jock, Sandy: Bob Godfrey, Percy Herbert) injure themselves in trying to pick up the balls, whereas he manages to pick one up, throw it and catch it. Mimi is so impressed the other girls decide she is a risk and lock her in her room.At the grouse shoot, one of Sir James' cape buttons has been substituted with a homing beacon, and the girls send rocket-launched explosive-laden dummy grouse towards him. Assisted by Mimi, who has escaped down the rather unsafe drainpipe from her room, Sir James uses his braces to fire the button back into the rocket launcher, blowing it up. Mimi, injured, wins a farewell kiss from Sir James (""Madam, are you quite sure you're dying?"") before entering a convent, and tells him that their orders came from ""Authority: International Mothers' Help, East Berlin"" (1).Driving back from Scotland, Sir James is trailed by a remote-controlled booby-trapped milk float (control girl Penny Riley), but manages to escape so that it kills yet another Smersh agent (). In London, he takes over as head of the British Secret Service, whose only surviving members are his secretary Miss Moneypenny (or rather her daughter; Barbara Bouchet), and his assistant Hadley (or rather his son; Derek Nimmo), who explain that all the secret agents apart from Sir James' replacement (now doing television) have been killed in sexually suggestive situations (""stabbed to death in a ladies sauna bath"", ""burnt in a blazing bordello"", ""garrotted in a geisha house"", etc.) with the possible exception of Sir James' nephew, Jimmy Bond (Woody Allen), last seen in the Caribbean escaping a firing squad (""I have a very low threshold of death"") with an exploding cigarette, only to end up in front of another firing squad. Sir James decides to call up all the auxiliary staff, and to create the ultimate 'Anti-Female Spy Device' - a man whom all women desire, but who is indifferent to them. Miss Moneypenny is tasked with finding one such (""your mother did some of her best work at night""), and she finds Cooper ('Coop': Terence Cooper: ""Sounds like something for keeping birds."" ""That's me""). Coop, a holder of the 'Kama Sutra Black Belt', is then sent for his anti-female training, against a gym-full of a variety of exotic, exotically dressed Bond girls (Yvonne Marsh, Veronica Gardnier - there are over 200 beautiful girls in the film), overcoming them all but eventually meeting new secret weapon The Detainer (Daliah Lavi), who also becomes 007 (""I don't do anything, but, unless you're one of them, you do""), Sir James having decided that to create confusion all agents, both male and female, will become 'James Bond, 007'.Sir James personally recruits two new 007 spies. The first is wealthy Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress: assistant Valentine Dyall), who Sir James persuades using a £5m tax arrears demand (2). Vesper is given the task of approaching and recruiting Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers: ""Isn't Evelyn a girl's name? No, its mine""), an expert in baccarat at the Buckingham Club, whom Sir James wants to use to defeat Smersh's treasurer, Le Chiffre (Orson Welles), currently gambling with Smersh's money at Casino Royale. She does this, seducing Tremble at her Mayfair flat (to which she has lately had Nelson's Column removed) and also encouraging him to dress up in a number of costumes (including Napoleon - complete with 'Sunny Elba' pamphlet - Hitler and Toulouse-Lautrec: ""Come on, you have more to do"". ""More?!""). Tremble, now also James Bond, 007, goes to Q (Geoffrey Bayldon) and his fey assistant Fordyce (John Wells) in their cellars full of inept inventions (where he is also shadowed by a dwarf dressed as a garden gnome ""He's our security man"") for his fitting with a gadget-filled suit (""a little bit tight about the..."" ""Poison capsule compartment?"").Sir James then recruits his own daughter by Mata Hari, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet), currently working as a living Eastern goddess (""Celestial Virgin of the Sacred Altar"" ""Figuratively speaking, of course"": temple guard Milton Reid, monk John Hollis): there is a superb temple dance sequence. Mata Bond is sent to West Berlin by London taxicab (taxicab driver Bernard Cribbins) to infiltrate International Mothers' Help, known to be a Smersh cover for the Mata Hari School of Dancing, a spy training school, with rather complex neo-Cubist décor, presided over by the formidable Frau Hoffner (Anna Quale) and the diminutive Polo (Ronnie Corbett). Revealing her identity as Mata Hari's daughter, she is shown by Polo to her mother's old room (""What an enormous bed!"" ""The German army was very large in those days""), where she discovers a secret passageway activated by the cistern, which leads to a projection suite: she also discovers 'little Otto' one of her mother's lovers (""Is he dead?"" ""Hard to tell. He always looked like that""). She learns that Le Chiffre is, via his agent (Vladek Sheybal) auctioning his art collection of blackmail photographs to raise money: the auction in the auditorium is attended by officers from the British (Jack Gwilliam, Richard Wattis), Chinese (Burt Kwouk), American (Hal Galili) and Russian armies. Warned by the taxi-driver (revealed as Carlton-Towers of the Foreign Office) to prevent Le Chiffre raising the money, as the bidding for the first lot escalates (""Seventy million tons of rice!"" ""Sixty tons of caviar!""), Mata returns to the projection room, seizes the case of projector slides and flushes them away: she then escapes Polo by unplugging his external heart battery, Frau Hoffner is shot by Otto, and Mata, using a foam fire-extinguisher on the assorted military, makes good her escape with Carlton-Towers (first trying a drain, but on hearing 'What's New, Pussycat', by taxi back to London). Le Chiffre's agent, telephoning him to report his failure, and that Smersh's leader Dr. Noah now knows what Le Chiffre has been up to, is blown up in his telephone box (the explosion also destroys part of the Berlin Wall).Tremble now travels to Casino Royale, where after meeting Matthis, a French inspector of police (with an improbable Scots accent; Duncan Macrae (3)) , and having a car-wash with many eavesdroppers (yet more beautiful girls), in his room meets Miss Goodthighs (Jacqueline Bisset) ""the management of the Hotel Tropical present their compliments"" who attempts to drug him with doped champagne. Vesper arrives, 'takes care of' Miss Goodthighs, and rouses Tremble.Vesper and Tremble go the Casino: they deposit £100,000 (cashier Graham Stark) and then meet the casino director Slimmington-Jones (Colin Gordon) in his office. Tremble spots that Le Chiffre is using infra-red spectacles to cheat: Vesper steals these: Le Chiffre shows off with some magic (assistants Jennifer Baker, Susan Baker), and then Tremble and Le Chiffre play a very-high-stakes baccarat game (50 million francs: ~£3.6m or $10m at the time), which Tremble ultimately wins. Tremble takes his winnings as a cheque drawn on a Swiss bank.On the way out of the Casino, Vesper is kidnapped: Tremble, advised of this by the doorman (John Bluthal) follows in a racing car (the racing car driver Sterling Moss, as himself, having run off) but is also captured by Le Chiffre, who wants the cheque. Placed in a very elaborate but broken chair in Le Chiffre's dungeon, he suffers torture - not physical, but mental - eventually becoming a Scot in full Highland costume attacked by four Scots marching bands (including Peter O'Toole), he is rescued by Vesper using a machine gun disguised as bagpipes, who then, however, betrays and kills him (and presumably takes the cheque: ""Never trust a rich spy'). Le Chiffre is then killed by Smersh agents sent by Dr. Noah.Back in London, Sir James goes to see the Prime Minister, leaving Mata to sight-see (""Mummy would have taken me in"" ""Mummy took everyone in""): she is captured by a Household Cavalry officer () on horseback and taken by flying saucer, which lands on the now-vacated site of Nelson's Column, to Casino Royale, where, it is now revealed, the secret headquarters of Smersh's leader Dr. Noah are located (announcer Valentine Dyall). Advised of this by former agent Mimi, now a nun collecting donations (""This department has always been very helpful to needy girls"") Sir James and Moneypenny follow to Casino Royale: attacked in the casino director's room (which is a lift connecting to Dr. Noah's HQ, activated by pushing the eye of a stuffed tiger) they eventually win through to an audience hall with chairs made of gold ingots to see Dr. Noah himself - who turns out to be Sir James' missing nephew, Jimmy Bond. Jimmy is however speechless in his uncle's presence: ""I never should have let Nellie send him to progressive school... I'm beginning to think you're a trifle neurotic"". Dr. Noah/Jimmy reveals part of his plans (using a taped message); to release a bacillus which will leave all women beautiful and all men shorter than himself; and then hits a gong to summon his staff and have Sir James and Moneypenny incarcerated.Dr. Noah then reveals to The Detainer, whom he has also captured, stripped and strapped down to a couch (""I learnt that in the Boy Scouts""), his desire to outshine his uncle, and the rest of his plans: to substitute robot doubles for all world leaders (some of which he has already done). He also shows her a pill he has invented, which ""looks like an aspirin, it tastes like an aspirin, but it is not an aspirin"" - it is in fact an atomic bomb, which goes off after 400 chain reactions. Feigning interest in him, she is released, steals the pill, and manages to slip it into his champagne, and he starts his hiccup-visualized countdown.Sir James, Mata, Moneypenny and Coop (captured earlier) now manage to escape the psychedelically-decorated room in which they have been imprisoned (using exploding 'vaporized lysergic acid' (4)), and making their way back to the audience hall (""Super place for a coming-out party"") and meeting up with The Detainer, find their way back to the Casino (with the aid of Frankenstein's monster: David Prowse). Whilst The Detainer escapes, Sir James tries to call London for aid, but is stopped by Vesper; ""Dear Vesper. The things you do for money"": who has, however, apparently fallen in love with him, and everything that has happened has been a plan to lure him to her at Casino Royale. He overpowers her, and then he and the remaining James Bonds initiate an attack on the Smersh agents in the Casino, aided by the French (Jean-Paul Belmondo: translates 'Merde!' as 'Ouch') and the Americans, both horse-riding Cowboys and tomahawk-wielding Red Indians (air-dropped with tepees as parachutes: Ransome reappears also): George Raft (as himself) shots himself during the affray, and the Keystone Cops have a cameo. Dr. Noah appears with the final chain-reaction countdown hiccups, and the Casino is explosively completely destroyed, killing all five remaining James Bonds (Sir James, Coop, Vesper, Mata, Moneypenny), as well as Dr. Noah/Jimmy Bond. The closing song explains that six James Bonds (including Tremble) go to ""a heavenly spot"", Jimmy to ""a place where it's terribly hot"").Notes:
(1) For younger readers: During the Cold War, the city of Berlin was divided by the Berlin Wall (1961-1989) into West Berlin (under Allied control: the Wall surrounded this) and East Berlin (under Soviet control). One of the motifs of the film is that the International Mothers' Help building straddles the border, this being reflected in the interior décor and lighting, and a symbolic rope bisecting the auditorium.
(2) In 1967, £5m was half of art auctioneers Christie's annual turnover. Nowadays (2009) it buys 10% of a Titian.
(3) There is also a brief pre-credits scene where Tremble (as James Bond) and the Inspector meet in a pissoir
(4) Lysergic acid is a precursor for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD - very Sixties). As its melting point is 240oC, and its (theoretical) vaporization point considerably higher (it degrades), a certain technical liberty is taken by considering it to be an explosive vapour collectable in a seat-cushion-cover in the film(Original version retained below - fades a bit to the end)Any movie directed by 5 different people is bound
to be confusing. This is, off course, no exception.The movie starts off with James Bond (Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers)) meeting Lieutenant Mathis
(Duncan Macrae) of the Special Police in a pissouir in Paris. After Bond checks Mathis' credentials, he follows him out.The credits roll.4 cars come in from different directions - a Citroen, a Cadilac, a Bently, and what appears to be something Russian. The 4 chaufers wait by their cars as the 4 passengers get into a Rolls Royce, driven by a fifth chaufer.Through conversations between M (McTarry (John Huston)), Ransome (William Holden), Le Grand (Charles Boyer), and Smernov (Kurt Kasznar), we learn that this is the home of the original James Bond. He is pure of mind and body. They property is protected by many lions.James is exercising as the gentlemen arrive. He has a stutter. He complains that the agent that replaced him as James Bond 007 is leaving a trail of dead women behind; that the new gadgets have taken the honour from the profession.He takes them outside to show them his black rose. Each spy head complains that they are losing agents at an alarming rate. They want James to come out of retirement to fix their shared problems.James interrupts them to play some Debussy. We learn that Bond retired because he had to lure his lover, Mata Hari, to her death. He returns from playing. M shows him a letter from the Queen. Still, he refuses the request to return to duty. M lights a cigar as a signal, and British troops bomb the property. His mansion is destroyed and M's toupee is blown off.Cut to a Smersh control room. We hear the head of Smersh (Authority) tell them that James Bond is back, with his morals, vows, and celebate image in tact. He tells them to initiate Plan B to attempt to destroy that image.We see James driving his Morgan (?) through the British countryside into Scotland. Various spys report his progress. We learn that he is heading for M's (McTarry's) castle. Plan B is in operation with Agent Mimi taking the place of M's widow (Lady Fiona) because she has the best Scot's accent.Sir James presents the remains of M to Lady Fiona (Deborah Kerr). They explain that they'd heard of the death from the Grey Piper. The room is full of women, mourning. They prepare a traditional hagis feast for midnight, where they will dance the traditional Scotish Fling and drink Ouskabar. It is explained (there's a lot of explaining going on, but it really doesn't help) that they drink until they drop in their tracks, then after an hour's rest, the piper awakes them for the morning grouse shoot.James is shown to his room, where Meg and Heather help him undress for his bath. The room is full of paintings of nude women. Meg and Heather tell him that they are 2 of M's 11 daughters - all between the ages of 16 and 19. As they walk down the hall to the bath, they walk past a series of bedrooms, each with a gorgeous girl peering out.James goes into the bath room and starts to undress, when he notices that 17 year old Buttercup is in the tub - testing the water temperature (""Daddy's little thermometer""). She invites him in to scrub his back. James has to turn on the cold water to avoid certain embarassment.Cut to James' room, where we see Meg and Heather swapping a button on his coat - but they are speaking French! We learn that the button is to be used only as a last resort - that Mimi's never failed before.At the hagis feast, everyone is drinking scotch. Two girls have their legs entwined with James at the table, as he listens to Mimi pass on some of the McTarry folklore. Everyone eventually passes out except James, who takes his cup and the scotch decanter up to his room.He's enjoying a nightcap as Mimi comes in and declares ""her Widow's Due"", insisting that James ""doodle her"". He refuses, so she insists that he ""pay the piper"". She blows a silly trumpet solo on a hunting horn, and calls the huge Scottish pipers in. They are going to ""wassle"" - play catch with heavy stone cannon balls.The first 5 do themselves in trying to lift and throw the balls. The sixth manages a throw that James catches and throws back. The piper catches the ball, but the weight forces him back, into an armour display, which falls on him and knocks him out. James then picks up the last wassle ball and karate chops it in 2. Mimi is stricken. She praises him in French, blowing her cover. The other girls realize, and lock Mimi in her room.The next morning, James is out for the grouse shoot. Mimi's locked in her room, and realizes that James is in trouble. The truck that brought the beaters is actually a launcher of exploding grouse. Mimi escapes by sliding down a drainpipe outside her window, and come to warn James that the button on his coat is actually a homing device. He shoots the grouse before they can get too close, and tells Mimi to take off his braces. They use them like a slingshot to fire the button back towards the beaters. The beaters use a garter belt to fling the homing button back. James grabs the return shot, and Mimi is able to fire it into the grouse launcher. Mimi is injured, and commits herself to a nunnery. She tells James that they are run by International Mother's Help in Berlin.James leaves the McTarry estate, but is followed by a woman driving an E-Type Jaguar. The women in the Smersh control room activate a rigged milk truck. Through some tricky driving, James gets in front of the Jag, and the milk truck loses its visual feed to Control. Control has to set the truck to automatic. James drives into his gated estate and gets the gate closed as the Jag spins into them. The milk truck plows into the Jag, and they both explode.James shows up at MI5, sees Moneypenny, and gives her a big kiss. Moneypenny enjoys it, but explains that she is actually Moneypenny's daughter. James is on a mission, and has lost his stammer. He meets Hadley, who is also the son of the original Hadley.Hadley goes over the state of MI5's agents. Most have been lured to their death by enemy women agents. The replacement James Bond has quit to ""do television"". James' nephew, Jimmy Bond was working as a spy in the Caribbean, but hasn't been heard from in a while. In a flashback, we see Jimmy (Woody Allen) about to face a firing squad. He escapes using an exploding cigarette.James assigns Moneypenny to find a replacement 007 agent that is desireable to women, but can be trained to resist them. She selects agent Cooper, and spends the night confirming that he is good with women. The next day, she is having trouble staying awake, but James likes Coopers credentials (6"" 2 1/2', 184 lbs, Kama Sutra Black Belt).James announces that all remaining agents and trainees will be known as ""James Bond 007"" to confuse the enemy.Cooper goes through his anti-female training, flipping off a girl dressed identically to Ursula Andres in Dr. No. The third girl appears later as Dr. Noah's prisoner.James shows up at the headquarters of Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress). We learn that she is the world's richest spy. She negotiates a trade of the Eiffel Tower for nuclear warheads, and purchases the Lord Nelson's statue. James requests her help in exchange for reducing a large writ for tax arears.Vesper approaches Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers) at the Buckingham Club. They come close to kissing, as Vesper suggestively tells him that she would like to go over some of the passeges in his book on winning at Baccarat. She has been reading it in her bed. She will send her car to bring him to her place.Evelyn arrives as Vesper is disposing of a body. In one of the best looking shots in the movie, they walk behind a huge aquarium - in slow motion - to ""The Look of Love"" song. Vesper is waiting for Evelyn on (in?) her sunken couch. Evelyn admires Lord Nelson's statue from her window. After some suggestive banter, we see Evelyn exercising in his pyjamas and Vesper wearing a nightgown. She films Evelyn dressing up as Hitler, Napolion (complete with a ""Sunny Elba"" brochure) and Toulouse-Lautrec. She requests his help in breaking La Chiffre, who likes to play high stakes Baccarat. Evelyn accepts, and agrees to become James Bond for the assignment.Evelyn shows up at the MI5 training facility, where we see frog-men firing bows and arrows and a drill sergent leading his men into an elevator. Evelyn is fitted with a wrist-TV, and body armour vest.Cut to James Bond's office, and James has learned that International Mother's Help (IMH) is a Smersh front. He decides that Mata Bond should try to infiltrate. She is his iligitmate daughter with Mata Hari.She gets to IMH and destroys the slides, forcing Le Chiffre to play baccarat.Tremble to France / Carwash / Miss GoodthighsVesper & Tremble to CasinoLe Chiffre's Magic, swap glassesTremble plays one hand, and loses.

Accountant Leopold ""Leo"" Bloom (Gene Wilder), a young man who is highly nervous and prone to hysterics, arrives at Max's office to do his books and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, Leo has a revelation: a producer could make a lot more money with a flop than a hit by overselling shares in the production, because no one will audit the books of a play presumed to have lost money. Max immediately puts this scheme into action. They will oversell shares on a massive scale and produce a play that will close on opening night, thus avoiding payouts and leaving the duo free to flee to Rio de Janeiro with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison, but Max eventually convinces him that his drab existence is no better than prison.After reading many bad plays (including a stage adaptation of Franz Kafka's 'The Metamorphosis'), the partners find the obvious choice for their scheme: Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden. It is ""a love letter to Hitler"" written in total sincerity by deranged ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). Max and Leo persuade Liebkind to sign over the stage rights, telling him they want to show the world ""the Hitler you loved, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler with a song in his heart."" To guarantee that the show is a flop, they hire Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett), a director whose plays ""close on the first day of rehearsal."" The part of Hitler goes to a charismatic, but only semicoherent, flower power hippie named Lorenzo Saint DuBois, also known as L.S.D. (Dick Shawn), who can barely remember his own name and mistakenly wandered into the theater during the casting call. After Max sells 25,000% of the play to his regular investors (dozens of lustful little old ladies), they are sure to be on their way to Rio.The result of all this is a cheerfully upbeat and utterly tasteless musical play purporting to be about the happy home life of a brutal dictator. It opens with a lavish production of the title song, ""Springtime for Hitler,"" which celebrates Nazi Germany crushing Europe (""Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for Poland and France""). After seeing the audience's dumbfounded disbelief, Max and Leo, confident that the play will be a flop, go to a bar across the street to celebrate and get drunk. Unbeknownst to them, the audience ends up finding L.S.D.'s beatnik-like portrayal (and constant ad-libbing) hilarious and misinterprets the production as a satire. During intermission, some members of the audience come to the bar at which Max and Leo are drinking and rave about the play, much to Max's and Leo's shared horror. The two decide to return to the theater after intermission to hear what the rest of the audience has to say, which echoes what the others already said. Meanwhile, L.S.D.'s portrayal of Hitler enrages and humiliates Franz, who after going behind the stage, untying the cable holding up the curtain, and rushing out on stage confronts the audience and rants about the treatment of his beloved play. However, someone behind the curtain manages to knock him out and remove him from the stage, and the audience assumes that Franz's rant was part of the act. Springtime For Hitler is declared a smash hit, which means, of course, that the investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out. Bialystock is frustrated and miserable. I was so careful, he laments. ""I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast...where did I go RIGHT?!?""As the stunned partners turn on each other, a gun-wielding Franz confronts them, accusing them of breaking the ""Siegfried Oath"". After failing to shoot Max and Leo, Franz tries to shoot himself, but runs out of bullets. Leo comforts Franz, while Max tries to convince Franz to kill the actors, but Leo intervenes. After a reconciliation, the three band together and decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are injured, arrested, tried, and found ""incredibly guilty"" by the jury. Before sentencing, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for changing his life and being his friend (while also referring to him as ""the most selfish man I have ever met in my life""), and Max tells the judge that they have learned their lesson.Max, Leo, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary. There they produce a new play called Prisoners of Love... a show which proves to be even worse than Springtime For Hitler (mostly because, this time, Leo and Max are actually striving to make a good play instead of a bad one). While Max and Franz earnestly supervise rehearsals, Leo continues their old scam - overselling shares of the play to their fellow prisoners, and even to the warden.

                    Brash and loud Max Bialystock was once a successful Broadway producer who now resorts to wooing and seducing elderly women, each with their own specific sexual peccadillo, to raise enough money for his shows. Leo Bloom, a nervous man prone to hysterics, is the latest person Max's accounting firm has sent to audit Max's books. The two decide to join forces to produce a Broadway show after an innocent passing comment by Leo: that a producer can make more money with a flop that closes after one performance than a success as the producer would not have to pay back the investors as the investors have bought into a specific percentage of the show. Thus their goal is to raise as much money as possible to produce a guaranteed flop that closes after one performance. Their first task is to find the worst show ever written, which they believe they have in the offensive ""Springtime for Hitler"", a musical love story to the famed dictator written by patriotic and deranged Nazi German, Franz Liebkind. Max then goes into overdrive to raise the money from his regular stable of elderly female investors and those of a similar ilk. He is so successful in this venture, selling 25,000% of the show, that Max decides to get a human plaything as his short term reward. And they are able to hire who is considered the worst director in the business, Roger De Bris, and miscast the lead role with an actor who goes by his initials, L.S.D., which truly does match his nature. But with all these pieces to produce a sure-fired flop, have they actually created the perfect storm?

    Synopsis
    The once-great Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) had once been the toast of Broadway, but now he has been reduced to a washed-up, aging, fraudulent, corruptible, and greedy Broadway producer who barely ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women (""angels"" in theatrical terms) in exchange for money for his next play. Accountant Leopold ""Leo"" Bloom (Gene Wilder), a young man who is highly nervous and prone to hysterics, arrives at Max's office to do his books and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play.

A classic portrayal of teen angst, where these impoverished, battered kids, who have turned out badly, are determined to brutalize everyone around them. The teachers let them dance between classes to vent some of their aggressive energy, but they all treat the classroom as though it were an unsupervised sandbox. With transcendent dignity, Thackary tames them and teaches them self-respect. As sentimental as the plot may be, the kids' transition is touching, and Poitier is as cool and classy as ever.

She reveals how she started a journey toward success by leaving her small New England town for New York City. When she gets to the city, she takes a work assignment with a talent agency, and immediately she starts to discover the harsh realities of show business. The agency sends her to a local theater to deliver contracts to renowned performer Helen Lawson (Susan Hayward). Helen's agent warns Anne not to let her guard down around Helen, and Helen's abrasiveness shocks Anne, who was expecting Helen to be true to her glamorous image. Instead, Helen is tough talking, uses vulgar language, and Anne's idle chatter with Helen sparks a terrible reaction and she sees first hand the evil and selfish woman that Helen really is. When Anne comments that a young woman singing down the hall is very good, Helen agrees, and immediately decides to have the girl fired from the show because the egotistical Helen fears being upstaged. Helen sends Anne back to the office with the contracts in shreds, threatening to leave the agency if Anne's boss doesn't get rid of the competition.The young girl that Helen sees as her rival is Neely O'Hara (Patty Duke), a talented up-and-coming singer. She is distraught when she finds out that her musical number has been cut from the show. Since all that remains for her is just a few lines of dialogue, she decides to leave the show all together. Also part of the show is a lovely showgirl named Jennifer North (Sharon Tate), who sympathizes with Neely when she's cut from the show.When Anne returns to the office to give the news about Helen (whom Anne now refers to as an ""evil queen bitch""), she instead finds the agency's younger partner, Lyon Burke (Paul Burke). Burke and Anne are immediately attracted to one another, and when Anne tells Lyon that she wants to leave the agency after her frightening brush with the mean-spirited Helen, Lyon persuades her to stay. Pulling some strings for Anne's new friend, Lyon sets up Neely to appear on a popular telethon, where she is immediately noticed. Neely and her boyfriend, Mel (Martin Milner), live in a humble apartment in New York, but after her career takes off they are married. Neely's popularity skyrockets and her demanding schedule for concerts and singing gigs leads her to start taking pills. Neely first takes caffeine pills to wake her up in the morning as well as amphetamines keep her going during the day, then takes downers to help get to sleep at night.Anne and Lyon embark on a tenuous affair. Anne seems shy about spending the night with Lyon, and she brings up the idea of marriage. Lyon firmly declares himself a bachelor, however, and does not approve of the idea of marriage. When Anne's mother dies, she goes back to her home town to mourn, and Lyon joins her there later. They have a moment of reckoning; Anne makes it clear that she feels cheap for being sexually involved with Lyon knowing that he will never marry her. Lyon leaves a farewell letter for Anne the next day, telling her that he can no longer see her. Simultaneously, Anne gets a sudden opportunity to model for a cosmetics company, and she becomes a nationally known figure. Anne's face now appears on TV commercials, billboards, newspaper and magazine advertisements.Meanwhile, Jennifer begins an affair with Tony Polar (Tony Scotti), a lounge singer whose career is also mounting. Tony's sister, Miriam (Lee Grant), manages every aspect of Tony's life, and reacts to the relationship with icy disapproval. A little later, Jennifer and Tony get married secretly, and Miriam is despondent.Elsewhere, Neely's fame eventually proves to be too much for her. Her Broadway stardom leads to a career in the movies as she relocates to Hollywood, but her addiction to pills (which she refers to as 'dolls') sabotages her life. She loses Mel when he becomes weary of her vicious and unpredictable behavior, as well as her rumored affair with a Hollywood designer named Ted Casablanca (Alexander Davion). When Mel leaves Neely after filing for divorce, she becomes associated with Ted and ultimately marries him.Jennifer's married life with Tony seems happy enough, although Miriam lives with them and obviously imposes on their marriage. After moving to Los Angeles, Jennifer and Tony settle in a house while Jennifer's modeling career flourishes, Tony's career has peaked, having made the crossover into motion pictures without the same drug-induced success as Neely. One evening, Tony begins to lose control of his motor functions, and Miriam finally reveals to Jennifer why she never wanted Tony to marry: Tony suffers from a rare motor-reutron disease called Hunington's Disease, (similar to A.L.S.) that will ultimately render him senseless and eventually kill him. The disease is genetic and was passed down to Tony from his father who died from the disease several years ago. Jennifer is mortified, because she has just discovered she is pregnant.Some months later, Anne and Lyon rekindle their affair after her modeling success, with Anne leaving behind another beau to reunite with Lyon and relocate to Los Angeles (as well as keep in close touch with both Neely and Jennifer), but she still seethes inside over the knowledge that Lyon isn't interested in marrying her. Neely shows up at her house one night while Lyon is on a business trip, and she tells Anne that Jennifer called her wanting to know where she could get an abortion. Neely also offers Anne some of her pills to help her get through her lonely period with Lyon gone, but Anne bitterly refuses. Neely's conversation with Anne sparks something in her; when she confides in Anne that her marriage with Ted is on the rocks, Anne encourages her to try and renew the spark in their relationship. Neely returns home to her home in the Hollywood Hills only to find Ted frolicking in their backyard swimming pool with another woman. They have a bitter fight and Ted walks out on her.Sinking further into alcohol and pills, Neely is thrown off of the current film project she is working on due to her drunkeness and verbal fights with the crew. When Lyon attempts to get her to a sanitarium to dry out, she sneaks off to San Francisco and spends a few days wandering while drunk and stoned. After she is robbed by a strange man, she is finally picked up and taken to a clinic in L.A. by Lyon and Anne. While there, she goes through some horrible withdrawal symptoms and has some bizarre run-ins with the other residents in the sanitarium. However, she is inspired when she discovers that Jennifer's husband, Tony, is also in the same hospital, now almost completely debilitated. Neely and Tony sing a song together in the hospital recreation room before he lapses back into senselessness. This incident prompts Neely to struggle back to sobriety.Jennifer, meanwhile, is struggling with her own demons. She also begins taking pills and booze to help her cope with Tony's absence as well as an escape for her loneliness. Consistently told by her selfish and manipulative mother that she has no real talent and is only known for her beautiful body, Jennifer turns to making ""art"" films with a French director to make money. She feels her integrity is compromised by doing this, as she is still loyal to Tony and did most of her sexually provocative work before she was married to him. The high cost of Tony's hospital and sanitarium bills forces Jennifer to do the work, and the situation is made worse when she finds herself locked into an oppressive contract with the director which makes Jennifer slide into taking more pills and booze to suppress her emotions. She continues making softcore and hardcore ""art films"" while completely numb of feelings.Emerging from the sanitarium with what seems to be a fresh outlook, Neely makes a cryptic statement to Anne about ""stealing her man"". When Lyon takes Neely to New York to prepare for her comeback to the stage, the two of them share a hotel room, and it becomes clear to Anne that they are involved on a physical level. This is made more hurtful when Anne sees her name in the gossip column, the columnist commenting about how she is a ""big loser"" due to Neely and Lyon flaunting their affair all over New York. Anne finally succumbs to the lure of the ""dolls"", at first taking Neely's old pills and then getting a prescription of her own.In New York City, Lyon gives Neely strict orders to stay out of sight until the debut of her new Broadway show, but when he goes to a party in honor of Helen Lawson's new show, Neely makes an uninvited appearance. The photographers and reporters present give her a huge welcome, much to Helen's chagrin, and she slips off to the ladies room to avoid the ruckus. Neely, however, goes after her, and the two of them have a cat-fight in the ladies lounge. When the fight turns really ugly, Neely winds up tearing off Helen's wig, revealing her unflattering grey hair color underneath. Throwing Helen's wig in the toilet, Neely renders her unwilling to step back out into the party. Helen momentarily considers slipping out the back, until she resolves to face the party again with her hair wrapped in a colorful scarf.Back in Los Angeles, Jennifer's story comes to a sudden and sad close when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. She learns that she must have a mastectomy and checks herself into a hospital to have it done. But this is the final blow for her, as she feels that now she won't be able to support herself without her lovely body to rely on. After coming home from the hospital and following a friendly visit by Annie, Jennifer commits suicide by taking an overdose on pills. Her body is discovered the next day.Alone one day and devastated over Jennifer's death as well as the loss of Lyon to Neely, the drunk and stoned Anne wonders down the beach beside her house and after passing out in the surf, she returns to her house and smashes several furniture to pieces. She then decides to leave it all behind and a few days later, she returns to her snowy New England hometown where she is welcomed back by her aunt.In New York, Neely blows her big chance for her Broadway comeback when she gets into an argument with Lyon beforehand. She disregards him by saying ""Who needs you? You're just an agent!"" Lyon abandons her, no longer able to tolerate her egoistical behavior, and in response, Neely turns to a secret stash of pills. When it comes time for her stage entrance, Neely is completely disoriented and unable to perform, giving her understudy the chance to perform on opening night. Neely spends the night getting drunk in a nearby tavern, ultimately finding herself alone and disoriented in a deserted downtown alley.The next morning, Helen Lawson has a candid conversation with Lyon. She predicts that Neely will come back yet again from her latest blunder, simply because she has true talent, but that ultimately she'll destroy herself. She also warns Lyon that he should stop being so careless with his love life and settle down with Anne, before it's too late.Lyon seems to take this advice to heart and he travels upstate to Anne's snowy hometown where he proposes marriage to Anne, but it is indeed too late for them. Anne admits that she has waited so long for Lyon to propose that she now feels nothing when the offer's been made. Having emerged from her brief drug episode with a fresh outlook, Anne seems to be the only one among the three ladies who has learned from her experience. After pouring all her liquor bottles and pills down a sink, she walks off alone into the snowy landscape of her home town and ponders her next move alone and without the need for drugs or alcohol.","

"18","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061809/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","It is November 13, 1959. Perry Smith, a dwarfish, dreamy, soft-spoken man of Cherokee Indian and Dutch descent has been paroled from prison for the past few months. He's on a Greyhound Bus drifting from an unknown location to Kansas City and strumming his guitar. A little girl is fascinated by his strumming, but after he spots her, she walks away. He is to meet up with an old prison buddy, Willie Jay. But he's also expecting to meet with Dick Hickock, another former prison buddy from the local area that had written him a letter about a ""perfect score"" they could make in western Kansas and that he will meet him at the bus terminal.Dick Hickock is a charming young man from a simple farm family that own a small tract of land and live just outside of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City. His father is ill and dying of cancer. He informs his father that is coughing badly outside the outhouse that he will get them a better place. With his rifle in the backseat of his 1949 Chevrolet, he is ready to pick up Perry and begin his journey.At the Greyhound terminal in Kansas City, Perry phones the prison chaplain, Reverend James Post, inquiring about his friend Willie Jay. Perry is upset that he has not yet been released from prison and the chaplain warns him not to set foot into Kansas, since his parole has a condition that he is not to do so.Out in western Kansas in the town of Holcomb, near Garden City, we are introduced of a prosperous farmer by the name of Herbert Clutter and his family. He is a healthy, vigorous, kindly, yet straitlaced man of 48 years of age that has never used tobacco, alcohol, or caffeine in his life and having a glass of milk for breakfast. His beautiful and sweet 16 year old daughter gives him a morning kiss informing him of her busy day ahead and he finds his 15 year old son Kenyon down in the basement, who is sneaking a smoke and painting a box for his older sister's wedding. Herbert smells the smoke and pretends he doesn't know Kenyon is doing it, but knows and dismisses it. Herbert's wife Bonnie is an ailing and frail woman suffering psychosomatic illness and bedridden much of the time.Back at the Kansas City bus terminal, Perry is in the washroom treating his badly scarred knee that he got years ago from a motorcycle accident. Afterwards, he looks in the mirror and imagines himself performing in Las Vegas in a nightclub with empty chairs, but then Dick notices him and gets him out of his trance. They leave the terminal.Dick and Perry are on Interstate 670 entering Kansas. Perry has now broken parole entering Kansas. Dick informs him of the ""perfect score"" about a rich farmer in western Kansas named Herbert Clutter that he was tipped off on by a former prison buddy, Floyd Wells. He was told that Clutter had a safe with probably 10,000 dollars in it and that they could rob it and leave no witnesses, killing everybody in sight. We get to know these two people, Perry, a quiet, introspective, dreamy, but unstable young man and Dick, less intellectual, but more masculine and practical. Dick assures Perry that it was okay he didn't meet up with Willie Jay, because he is ""a flaming faggot"".Perry and Dick stop at a hardware store in Emporia purchasing duct tape, rubber gloves, and nylon rope for their victims. At the checkout stand, Dick steals a package of razor blades. They regret not having purchased nylon stockings, but Perry said maybe they could go to a Catholic church and get them after seeing nuns. Dick jokes and says, ""yeah, we'll just go barge in like it was a five and dime store"".On the trip we simultaneously see the everyday life of the Clutter family and Perry and Dick traveling. Herbert is writing a check to an insurance salesman for 40,000 in case anything happens to him and they have a television repairman come. Perry and Dick stop at a hamburger stand, Perry dreams of his childhood growing up with his Dutch father and Cherokee mother having rodeos all over the southwest, and they arrive in Garden City and stop at a Fina gas station to refuel. Perry is in the washroom gobbling aspirin and wincing from the pain in his leg and Dick steals some snacks at the counter while his car is being fueled. The Clutter family is about to go to bed and soon afterwards, Perry and Dick arrive at the Clutter house in Holcomb. Perry said they should split and not do this, but Dick talks him into it. They are both slightly drunk.The next morning, a friend of Nancy's and her parents are repeatedly ringing the doorbell at the Clutter home, but nobody answers. They cautiously enter the home. The girls father finds a severed phone cord and the girl is screaming. Afterwards, police cars and ambulances arrive at the Clutter home to take away the bodies. The postmistress, Sadie Truitt, is surprised at what's going on.Perry is asleep at a hotel in Olathe and Dick is at his parents modest home eating. He asks his father what happened to the basketball game and told it got interrupted because of a murder that happened in Garden City that's on the news. Dick jokes and declares he's never been so hungry in his life.Agent Alvin Dewey has been in charge of the case and is a local resident. He and another agent, Roy Church, have been dispatched to investigate the scene. They are trying to recover fingerprints and Dewey can't find a clue as to why they have been robbed, because Herbert Clutter never kept large sums of cash on him and did everything by check. They are later at the courthouse in Garden City seeing a slide show of bloody footprints seen of two different kinds of shoes and Dewey informs the men that the press do not get the information. After reviewing the slideshow, Dewey insists he will give only facts, mainly that Herbert Clutter's throat was cut and that the women were not molested. He meets up with a stern, but friendly and easygoing reporter, Bill Jensen, supposedly Truman Capote's alter ego. They converse alone in the courtroom and can't figure out the case, but Dewey informs him the two older daughters will get the insurance, even though it was written the same night of the murder. Agent Church is at the Clutter home with the housekeeper and she discovers that Kenyon's radio is missing.Back at the Olathe hotel, Perry and Dick are listening to the investigation on Kenyon's radio. Perry is disgusted that Dick's prison buddy Floyd Wells lied to him about the money and feels that the story is not true about no clues as to who did the crime. Dick tells him to quit worrying, even though he's a witness.Prisoner Floyd Wells hears the report of the Clutter murders on the radio and is surprised at the 1,000 dollar reward for anybody that has any clue of them. But still the agents have no clue of it. Yet somehow they knew that over 40 dollars in cash was stolen.Meanwhile about two days later, Perry and Dick are shopping in Kansas City. Dick plans to write a lot of hot checks for a fitted suit for Perry, whom he says is about to get married, an expensive ring, camera, and a television set. Afterwards they leave and are on their way to Mexico to never come back, hoping to score there.The investigation continues with men dragging a river near the Clutter home to search for the murder weapon. No success. Dewey and Agent Clarence Duntz go back to the Clutter home and find a man staying there they believe to be a suspect, but instead he turns out to be an escaped mental patient occupying the place.Dewey and Bill Jensen meet at Hartman's Cafe, a small restaurant in Holcomb managed by Bess Hartman, a sassy, no-nonsense woman. Dewey receives an immediate phone call there from Harold Nye, another agent assigned to the case, with a phone call from Lansing, Kansas from Logan Sanford, head of Kansas Bureau of Investigation. There is a confession from Floyd Wells, Dick Hickcok's former cellmate about Floyd being a former hired man for Clutter and how he told Dick about Clutter's place and all the money and a safe that he had and that Dick wanted to rob the place. He explains how Dick was obsessed with the Clutter home, but never took him seriously. Sanford insists on a pickup for parole violation for Hickock and that he's also wanted for passing hot checks.Perry and Dick cross the border from Laredo, Texas into Mexico, believing they are now safe and sound and off to live the good life.Somewhere in Nevada in an auto junkyard with a decrepit trailer, Agents Dewey and Church meet with Tex Smith, a man nicknamed ""The Lone Wolf"" a reclusive, eccentric, yet courteous 60-ish man that is the father of Perry. They inquire of Perry's whereabouts and if he's seen him, but he says he has not seen Perry since his stint in prison, but they do the math and realize he hasn't seen Perry in years. Smith does most of the talking about Perry's background that he feels he learned his lesson and always taught his kids to be truthful, enterprising, sober, and independent, but that his wife that was a Cherokee Indian that took to drunkenness, sleeping with young men, and the kids living with that and that he put a stop to it. Also telling them of the story when Perry joined him in Alaska after getting out of the Army to prospect gold and building a lodge. The agents find the interview pointless in getting Perry captured and leave.Perry and Dick are living in a decrepit motel somewhere in Mexico. Perry believes that if they sell the car and buy some deep sea diving gear, they can get the buried treasures in the Yucatan Peninsula to get the Cortez jackpot. However, Dick being practical and realistic tells Perry to forget about it and that he's selling his car for $120 to pay their hotel bill, bar, food, and get a bus ticket to Barstow, California. Much to Perry's extreme disappointment, Dick tells him to knock it off, stop dreaming, and that it's all made up.Dewey and Bill Jensen are back at the Clutter home still trying to find out the motive of the murders. Even with a newspaper article written about how such an incident could happen months before, they still can't figure it out. But Dewey insists that once they are found, they'll hang.Dick is enjoying himself at the hotel with a prostitute, while Perry is packing his belongings. Perry takes a glimpse of the prostitute and she reminds him of his own mother. He has flashbacks of his mother sleeping with a younger man and drunk while he and his siblings look on. His father catches his mother in the act throwing the man out, slapping her bare back with a belt, and pouring her alcohol all over her back. It's made evident Perry had a very traumatic and unhappy childhood, despite his love and devotion for both of his parents and siblings.Perry and Dick are somewhere in the California desert hitching a ride. Dick comes up with a plan that Perry sit in the backseat and when Dick asks him to pass him a match, Perry take his belt to garrotte the driver and rob him. An elderly man in a jeep stops, but then drives away and changes his mind.

Perry and Dick are just about to cross into Kansas through a toll booth, but detect a police car. Perry turns the steering wheel around and he and Dick and go back before approaching the toll booth.Back in Garden City, Alvin Dewey is studying a map of Kansas about their possible travel route, then telephoned that Perry and Dick have eluded detection.

Perry concludes that his murder of the Clutter's was not personal, he just did it and thought Herbert Clutter was a very nice man.The next day, they arrive in Garden City, Kansas at the courthouse and both are jailed. Sometime later, their court case is presented by the prosecutor as a motive simply for money and that they need the death penalty, because life imprisonment would mean possible parole in 7 years. He also quotes The Ten Commandments ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"". Per Bill Jensen, the jury declared the death penalty.Perry and Dick are taken to Lansing, Kansas to the death row section. They spend the next five years there living a mundane life entirely of sitting in their cell with a weekly shower and only reading and writing material to keep themselves occupied outside their own thoughts.

                    In meeting in Kansas, ex-cons Perry Smith and Dick Hickock are breaking several conditions of their respective paroles. The meeting, initiated by Dick, is to plan and eventually carry out a robbery based on information he had received from a fellow inmate about $10,000 cash being locked in a hidden safe in the home of the farming Clutter family of Holcomb, Kansas. After the robbery, they plan on going to Mexico permanently to elude capture by the police. Each brings a necessary personality to the partnership to carry out the plan, Dick who is the brash manipulator, Perry the outwardly more sensitive but unrealistic dreamer with a violent streak under the surface. Perry literally carries all his dreams in a large box he takes with him wherever he goes. The robbery does not go according to plan in any respect, the pair who ultimately hogtie and execute all four members of the Clutter family, only coming away from the home with $43 in cash. As Perry and Dick go on the run, a murder investigation ensues, led by Topeka based Detective Alvin Dewey. If Dewey and his team are able eventually to identify the pair as the murderers and capture them, they, if they understand the two, may get their much needed confessions in dividing and conquering. Perry and Dick's fates may also be regardless of who literally pulled the trigger.

                    Truman Capote wrote the 'non-fiction novel' from which the film is drawn, using the novelist's craft to render reality. The reality was that at two a.m. on November 15, 1959 in the rural town of Holcomb, Kansas, the four members of the Clutter family were roused from their sleep, bound and gagged, and then brutally murdered by two unknown assailants. After the latters' capture, sentencing and imprisonment prior to execution, Capote researched the case thoroughly, spent weeks talking with the prisoners, Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, jurors, police, friends and neighbors, trying to unearth why such a senseless act was committed, and what society's response might have been.

    Synopsis
    It is November 13, 1959. Perry Smith, a dwarfish, dreamy, soft-spoken man of Cherokee Indian and Dutch descent has been paroled from prison for the past few months. He's on a Greyhound Bus drifting from an unknown location to Kansas City and strumming his guitar. A little girl is fascinated by his strumming, but after he spots her, she walks away. He is to meet up with an old prison buddy, Willie Jay. But he's also expecting to meet with Dick Hickock, another former prison buddy from the local area that had written him a letter about a ""perfect score"" they could make in western Kansas and that he will meet him at the bus terminal.Dick Hickock is a charming young man from a simple farm family that own a small tract of land and live just outside of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City. His father is ill and dying of cancer. He informs his father that is coughing badly outside the outhouse that he will get them a better place. With his rifle in the backseat of his 1949 Chevrolet, he is ready to pick up Perry and begin his journey.At the Greyhound terminal in Kansas City, Perry phones the prison chaplain, Reverend James Post, inquiring about his friend Willie Jay. Perry is upset that he has not yet been released from prison and the chaplain warns him not to set foot into Kansas, since his parole has a condition that he is not to do so.Out in western Kansas in the town of Holcomb, near Garden City, we are introduced of a prosperous farmer by the name of Herbert Clutter and his family. He is a healthy, vigorous, kindly, yet straitlaced man of 48 years of age that has never used tobacco, alcohol, or caffeine in his life and having a glass of milk for breakfast. His beautiful and sweet 16 year old daughter gives him a morning kiss informing him of her busy day ahead and he finds his 15 year old son Kenyon down in the basement, who is sneaking a smoke and painting a box for his older sister's wedding. Herbert smells the smoke and pretends he doesn't know Kenyon is doing it, but knows and dismisses it. Herbert's wife Bonnie is an ailing and frail woman suffering psychosomatic illness and bedridden much of the time.Back at the Kansas City bus terminal, Perry is in the washroom treating his badly scarred knee that he got years ago from a motorcycle accident. Afterwards, he looks in the mirror and imagines himself performing in Las Vegas in a nightclub with empty chairs, but then Dick notices him and gets him out of his trance. They leave the terminal.Dick and Perry are on Interstate 670 entering Kansas. Perry has now broken parole entering Kansas. Dick informs him of the ""perfect score"" about a rich farmer in western Kansas named Herbert Clutter that he was tipped off on by a former prison buddy, Floyd Wells. He was told that Clutter had a safe with probably 10,000 dollars in it and that they could rob it and leave no witnesses, killing everybody in sight. We get to know these two people, Perry, a quiet, introspective, dreamy, but unstable young man and Dick, less intellectual, but more masculine and practical. Dick assures Perry that it was okay he didn't meet up with Willie Jay, because he is ""a flaming faggot"".Perry and Dick stop at a hardware store in Emporia purchasing duct tape, rubber gloves, and nylon rope for their victims. At the checkout stand, Dick steals a package of razor blades. They regret not having purchased nylon stockings, but Perry said maybe they could go to a Catholic church and get them after seeing nuns. Dick jokes and says, ""yeah, we'll just go barge in like it was a five and dime store"".On the trip we simultaneously see the everyday life of the Clutter family and Perry and Dick traveling. Herbert is writing a check to an insurance salesman for 40,000 in case anything happens to him and they have a television repairman come. Perry and Dick stop at a hamburger stand, Perry dreams of his childhood growing up with his Dutch father and Cherokee mother having rodeos all over the southwest, and they arrive in Garden City and stop at a Fina gas station to refuel. Perry is in the washroom gobbling aspirin and wincing from the pain in his leg and Dick steals some snacks at the counter while his car is being fueled. The Clutter family is about to go to bed and soon afterwards, Perry and Dick arrive at the Clutter house in Holcomb. Perry said they should split and not do this, but Dick talks him into it. They are both slightly drunk.The next morning, a friend of Nancy's and her parents are repeatedly ringing the doorbell at the Clutter home, but nobody answers. They cautiously enter the home. The girls father finds a severed phone cord and the girl is screaming. Afterwards, police cars and ambulances arrive at the Clutter home to take away the bodies. The postmistress, Sadie Truitt, is surprised at what's going on.Perry is asleep at a hotel in Olathe and Dick is at his parents modest home eating. He asks his father what happened to the basketball game and told it got interrupted because of a murder that happened in Garden City that's on the news. Dick jokes and declares he's never been so hungry in his life.Agent Alvin Dewey has been in charge of the case and is a local resident. He and another agent, Roy Church, have been dispatched to investigate the scene. They are trying to recover fingerprints and Dewey can't find a clue as to why they have been robbed, because Herbert Clutter never kept large sums of cash on him and did everything by check. They are later at the courthouse in Garden City seeing a slide show of bloody footprints seen of two different kinds of shoes and Dewey informs the men that the press do not get the information. After reviewing the slideshow, Dewey insists he will give only facts, mainly that Herbert Clutter's throat was cut and that the women were not molested. He meets up with a stern, but friendly and easygoing reporter, Bill Jensen, supposedly Truman Capote's alter ego. They converse alone in the courtroom and can't figure out the case, but Dewey informs him the two older daughters will get the insurance, even though it was written the same night of the murder. Agent Church is at the Clutter home with the housekeeper and she discovers that Kenyon's radio is missing.Back at the Olathe hotel, Perry and Dick are listening to the investigation on Kenyon's radio. Perry is disgusted that Dick's prison buddy Floyd Wells lied to him about the money and feels that the story is not true about no clues as to who did the crime. Dick tells him to quit worrying, even though he's a witness.Prisoner Floyd Wells hears the report of the Clutter murders on the radio and is surprised at the 1,000 dollar reward for anybody that has any clue of them. But still the agents have no clue of it. Yet somehow they knew that over 40 dollars in cash was stolen.Meanwhile about two days later, Perry and Dick are shopping in Kansas City. Dick plans to write a lot of hot checks for a fitted suit for Perry, whom he says is about to get married, an expensive ring, camera, and a television set. Afterwards they leave and are on their way to Mexico to never come back, hoping to score there.The investigation continues with men dragging a river near the Clutter home to search for the murder weapon. No success. Dewey and Agent Clarence Duntz go back to the Clutter home and find a man staying there they believe to be a suspect, but instead he turns out to be an escaped mental patient occupying the place.Dewey and Bill Jensen meet at Hartman's Cafe, a small restaurant in Holcomb managed by Bess Hartman, a sassy, no-nonsense woman. Dewey receives an immediate phone call there from Harold Nye, another agent assigned to the case, with a phone call from Lansing, Kansas from Logan Sanford, head of Kansas Bureau of Investigation. There is a confession from Floyd Wells, Dick Hickcok's former cellmate about Floyd being a former hired man for Clutter and how he told Dick about Clutter's place and all the money and a safe that he had and that Dick wanted to rob the place. He explains how Dick was obsessed with the Clutter home, but never took him seriously. Sanford insists on a pickup for parole violation for Hickock and that he's also wanted for passing hot checks.Perry and Dick cross the border from Laredo, Texas into Mexico, believing they are now safe and sound and off to live the good life.Somewhere in Nevada in an auto junkyard with a decrepit trailer, Agents Dewey and Church meet with Tex Smith, a man nicknamed ""The Lone Wolf"" a reclusive, eccentric, yet courteous 60-ish man that is the father of Perry. They inquire of Perry's whereabouts and if he's seen him, but he says he has not seen Perry since his stint in prison, but they do the math and realize he hasn't seen Perry in years. Smith does most of the talking about Perry's background that he feels he learned his lesson and always taught his kids to be truthful, enterprising, sober, and independent, but that his wife that was a Cherokee Indian that took to drunkenness, sleeping with young men, and the kids living with that and that he put a stop to it. Also telling them of the story when Perry joined him in Alaska after getting out of the Army to prospect gold and building a lodge. The agents find the interview pointless in getting Perry captured and leave.Perry and Dick are living in a decrepit motel somewhere in Mexico. Perry believes that if they sell the car and buy some deep sea diving gear, they can get the buried treasures in the Yucatan Peninsula to get the Cortez jackpot. However, Dick being practical and realistic tells Perry to forget about it and that he's selling his car for $120 to pay their hotel bill, bar, food, and get a bus ticket to Barstow, California. Much to Perry's extreme disappointment, Dick tells him to knock it off, stop dreaming, and that it's all made up.Dewey and Bill Jensen are back at the Clutter home still trying to find out the motive of the murders. Even with a newspaper article written about how such an incident could happen months before, they still can't figure it out. But Dewey insists that once they are found, they'll hang.Dick is enjoying himself at the hotel with a prostitute, while Perry is packing his belongings. Perry takes a glimpse of the prostitute and she reminds him of his own mother. He has flashbacks of his mother sleeping with a younger man and drunk while he and his siblings look on. His father catches his mother in the act throwing the man out, slapping her bare back with a belt, and pouring her alcohol all over her back. It's made evident Perry had a very traumatic and unhappy childhood, despite his love and devotion for both of his parents and siblings.Perry and Dick are somewhere in the California desert hitching a ride. Dick comes up with a plan that Perry sit in the backseat and when Dick asks him to pass him a match, Perry take his belt to garrotte the driver and rob him. An elderly man in a jeep stops, but then drives away and changes his mind. Then Rosey Grier, a black football star of the New York Giants and a friend of his offer them a ride in his pink Cadillac, but they refuse. They end up taking a ride with a traveling salesman they form a friendly relationship with. Dick asks Perry to pass him a match, but just as Perry is about to garrotte the salesman, the man stops the car to pick up a soldier hitchhiking for Christmas.Agent Harold Nye is at the homestead of Walter Hickock, father of Dick, and discovers a 12 gauge shotgun he suspects is the murder weapon.

The baron's plan is to have Francesca show Felix around the island. Francesca's plan is to set Felix up for an ambush along the way. Fortunately, Felix bumbles himself from Dracula, the Mummy, and the Werewolf and all attempts to knock him off. Feeling betrayed by Dracula, Francesca concocts a new plan which involves inviting the diabolical IT to the island. In an attempt to escape from the wrath of the other monsters, however, Francesca finds herself falling in love with Felix.

This is partly because it's been so long since Yetch has seen all their friends, but also because he is besotted with the baron's secretary, the lovely, well-stacked, red-headed, cool-as-a-cucumber Francesca [Gale Garnet].As the baron and Francesca prepare to greet their guests, they are joined by Frankenstein's Monster and his Mate [Phyllis Diller]. First to arrive is Dracula, who is enchanted to see Francesca. (""You have always been my type...O-negative, isn't it?"") Next is the Werewolf. (""Wolfie, you old dog! This convention is going to be a howling success!"") The Invisible Man arrives. (""You're looking well...I think."") The Hunchback carries in the Mummy, then comes Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde, followed by the Creature. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Chef Mafia Machiavelli is preparing the menu for the party. There's octopus soup and a poison ivy salad with toadstools, poison berries, and three kinds of dressings -- arsenic, cyanide, and nitroglycerin. The antipasto consists of black widows marinated in their own poison, smoked lizards and snakes, and marinated mice. For the main course, there is boar's head, roasted vulture, and minced hyena casserole. In addition, entertainment is to be provided by Little Tibia and the Fibulas. As the dinner commences, the guests are all trying to figure out who will be the baron's successor. Dracula is assured that there is no one more evil, treacherous, and sneaky than he. Francesca thinks she might be able to use Dracula in order to attain the secrets for herself. The Monster and his Mate feel there can be no one closer to the baron than themselves (""He CREATED us!""). Ultimately, a big fight breaks out, and the guests spend the rest of the night trying to sleep it off.The next morning, the baron's nephew Felix arrives. The baron's plan is to have Francesca show Felix around the island. Francesca's plan is to set Felix up for an ambush along the way. Fortunately, Felix bumbles himself from Dracula, the Mummy, and the Werewolf and all attempts to knock him off. Feeling betrayed by Dracula, Francesca concocts a new plan which involves inviting the diabolical IT to the island. In an attempt to escape from the wrath of the other monsters, however, Francesca finds herself falling in love with Felix. As the two lovers make their way to the opposite side of the island where Francesca has a boat hidden, they are followed by the monsters who have decided unanimously to kill Felix. Just as the monsters capture Francesca and catch up with Felix, IT (King Kong) arrives. IT storms the castle, but when he finds a photo of Francesca, he falls madly in love with her. Grabbing Francesca in his oversized palm, IT climbs to the highest mountain where he is swarmed by airplanes flown by Baron von Frankenstein and his zombies. In his final act, the baron drops the vial of destruction, and the island blows up. Safe at sea, Felix makes plans to marry Francesca, but Francesca reveals that she cannot marry him because she is really only a machine fashioned by the baron. Felix consoles her. ""Don't worry, Francesca. None of us is perfect...is perfect...is perfect...is perfect...is perfect."" [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]

"23","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061584/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","During the opening credits, which feature animations of various animals, the orchestra plays an overture of three songs from the film, most notably ""Talk to the Animals."" The action begins in the quaint 19th century English seaside village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh. Matthew Mugg, an Irish fishmonger, meets his young friend Tom Stubbins, as Matt wheels his fish barrow around the wharf collecting fresh seafood for his customers. Matthew rescues an injured duck from a fisherman who intends to eat it for his dinner. As soon as Matthew finishes his rounds, he tells Tom they will take the duck to John Dolittle, the greatest animal doctor in the world. Matthew explains that Dolittle talks to the animals to determine what ails them. To explain further, Matthew sings ""My Friend the Doctor."" During the song Tom accompanies Matthew as he makes his deliveries to his customers. By the time the song ends, they have arrived at Dolittle's house. When a chimpanzee and a parrot answer the door, Matthew introduces Chee-Chee and Polynesia to Tom. After the introductions, they go into the library where Dr. Dolittle is trying to converse with some goldfish. He explains to Matthew and Tom that he is attempting to gather information about the legendary Great Pink Sea Snail. He soon plans to embark on a voyage to find the creature. Tom takes the duck out of his coat where he has been keeping it safe and hands it to the doctor. After a few quacks back and forth, Dolittle is certain that the drake has had a row with his wife. The doctor invites Tom and Matthew to dinner and instructs Polynesia, the parrot, to prepare for two more guests. Tom and Matthew had encountered a thunderstorm on the way to Dolittle's, so the good doctor furnishes them with dry clothes. When they return from changing out of their wet togs, Chee-Chee is frying sausages and bacon while a pig is squealing his displeasure. The doctor doesn't join them for dinner. He explains that he doesn't eat meat; it upsets the animals and besides one shouldn't eat their friends. In ""The Vegetarian,"" Dr. Dolittle explains further. Instead of meat, he eats such things as apple cores, plain brown bread and drinks parsnip juice. He admits, however, that the sausages look very good and begins to waver in his conviction. At that point, he calls such things as turnip pie and peanuts filth and rubbish and proclaims: ""I'm a cheat! I love meat!"" However, when he hears Gub-Gub, the pig, squeal, he returns to being a reluctant but sincere vegetarian. When Tommy asks how he became a veterinarian, Dolittle explains that his sister, Sarah, started it all. At that point, the film flashes back to an earlier time when Dolittle was a human doctor and his sister was his house keeper. Sarah complains when her brother brings animals into the house and gives them sleeping space all over the inside of their home. Presently, Lady Petherington arrives to see the doctor. Her nerves are frayed because during a dinner party the previous evening a mouse had scampered across her table. While she is explaining this to the doctor, little white mice are crawling on her chair and onto her enormous bonnet. Soon the village's Vicar arrives with a terrible sneeze. He explains to Sarah that the Bishop is coming to visit and the Vicar needs to be in good health when he arrives. Then the village Magistrate, General Bellowes, arrives with a bandaged foot. Suddenly, Lady Petherington screams and runs from the doctor's office. Her screams cause other accidents that cause more problems for the Vicar and Bellowes. By the time they all leave, Sarah presents an ultimatum to her brother: either the animals go or she goes. Dolittle chooses the latter option. Later that evening when Matthew stops by for a friendly visit, Dolittle is despondent. He admits to Matthew that he is not a good doctor because he really doesn't care about his patients. He doesnt have anything in common with the human race. From its perch, Polynesia says, ""Be an animal doctor."" Dolittle immediately likes the suggestion. After all, he says, there's not one good animal doctor in the west of England. When he learns that Polynesia, a 199-year-old parrot, speaks 2,000 animal languages, he asks if he could I learn to talk to animals? The parrot assures the kindly doctor that he could and that she will teach him. Dr. Dolittle is so keen on this idea that he expresses his feelings in ""Talk to the Animals."" Later, Matthew, Tommy and Polynesia join the doctor in the song. During the song, Dolittle goes to bed still thinking about all the animal languages he can learn so he can speak to each animal when he encounters them. In the morning, he is still awake and continuing to sing (in his mind). Once he dresses for the day and goes downstairs, Polynesia helps him say good morning to Gub-Gub, the pig, by combining sounds with foot and leg movements. The doctor is so excited with his success in communicating with the pig that he informs Polynesia that he wants to say good morning to every animal in Puddleby (and the song continues as they greet various animals). After the song, the film returns to 1845. Dr. Dolittle informs Tommy that he has learned 498 animal languages. The doctor is reminded that he'll need more than languages if he intends to search for the Great Pink Sea Snail. He'll also need lots of money. One of Dr. Dolittle's patients is a short sighted horse, which he furnishes with gigantic glasses. However, the horse's owner, General Bellowes, bursts into the doctor's office and accuses the doctor of being a horse thief. A mother fox and her babies get extremely nervous at the sight of Bellowes; he has been hunting foxes lately and has chased the mother. When the mother fox runs away, the horse bolts and runs out of the office too. Bellowes chases them , but is foiled by some skunks. Dolittle explains to Tom and Matthew that he imported the skunks from America to help protect the foxes. He assigns each skunk to a fox to disguise their smell from the foxhounds. Emma Fairfax, Bellowes' niece, had accompanied her uncle to Dolittle's office. She chides the doctor for his irresponsibility and rudeness to her Uncle. She would like to be a man so she could take revenge. For her feistiness, Matthew gives her the nickname ""Fred."" Her horse had been spooked by the skunks, so she is forced to walk home. During her walk across the countryside and through streams, Emma sings ""At the Crossroads."" In the lyrics, she admits that her life is not the one she intended to lead. Later, Dolittle and his friends find a huge package in his yard. When they open it they discover a two-headed llama-type creature from Tibet, the Pushmi-Pullyu. A picture message from Dolittle's friend, Long Arrow, accompanied the package; the message encouraged Dolittle to use the Pushmi-Pullyu to make the money necessary for the voyage to search for the Great Pink Sea Snail. Matthew, Tommy and Dolittle take the creature to a nearby circus owned by Albert Blossom. Once Blossom sees the creature, he is so excited he sings ""I've Never Seen Anything Like It."" He calls all the circus performers out to see this amazing animal. Dr. Dolittle sings about the Pushmi-Pullyu's dance ability and he and the creature demonstrate with a minuet-type dance. Once Blossom agrees to share the profits, he and Dolittle finally agree on a deal. The Pushmi-Pullyu becomes the star attraction of the Dolittle and Blossom Circus and crowds flock to see the creature dance. Emma is seen among those in the audience. Later, Emma comes to the circus to complain about Dolittle exploiting the animals, but Matthew defends his friend. Matthew, who is infatuated with ""Fred,"" attempts to help her understand by singing ""Beautiful Things."" He sings that our lives are full of beautiful things. By the end of the song, Emma seems to have changed her mind about the doctor. When the circus seal can't catch the ball thrown by his handler, Dr. Dolittle befriends the seal named Sophie and discovers that she misses her husband who is at the North Pole. Dolittle decides to take her to the Bristol Channel so she can swim to her husband. That night he sneaks her out of the circus dressed as a baby in a pram (perambulator). Once it is daylight, he dresses the seal in a woman's hat and clock he took from a tavern, so they can catch the coach to Bristol. When the road is blocked by police a few miles from Bristol, Dolittle and the seal transfer to a hay wagon. Once the driver stops, Dolittle talks to the horses into delivering the seal and the doctor to the rocky Bristol Channel shoreline. Just before he helps the seal into the sea, Dolittle sings ""When I Look Into Your Eyes."" Dolittle kisses Sophie goodbye and tosses her into the ocean still in the lady's clothing. When he turns around, two men are standing there; they think he has thrown a woman into the water, so he is hauled off to court.Unfortunately, the Magistrate for Dolittle's hearing is General Bellowes (Emma is seen in the court room). Of course, everyone thinks Dolittle is daft when he claims the seal asked him to help her get to her husband. The Doctor attempts to prove his ability to talk to animals by staging a conversation with Bellowes' Great Dane, Rufus. When Dolittle translates the dogs report of the gigantic dinner the General consumed the previous evening, Bellowes takes offense and dismisses the court until the following day. When Tommy and Matthew visit the doctor in his cell, Emma brings Tom and Matthew dinner and tells Dolittle that Rufus was correct about her Uncle's meal. The next day, the General announces that Dr. Dolittle has been acquitted, because the lady who owned the stolen clothes refused to prosecute (there seems to be some indication that the lady is Sarah, Dolittle's estranged sister), however, the General and a couple of other judges agree that Dr. Dolittle's talking to animals necessitates his being committed to an asylum. As his last speech before being taken away, Dolittle sings a clever song, ""Like Animals."" The doctor admits to not understanding the human race and accuses people of inhumane treatment of animals. He also abhors human phrases like ""treat him like a dog,"" ""working like a horse"" and ""eating like a hog"" (when we mean ""eating like a man""). He also complains that we call a hoodlum a weasel or a rat and a woman of ill-repute a vixen or a cat. He chides the women in the courtroom for wearing furs by asking them if they ever thought they were wearing someone's brother or mother. After his song, Dr. Dolittle is escorted to the jail awaiting transfer to the asylum. Matthew and Tommy plot to break their friend out, but Emma is skeptical that their plan will work. Matthew tells her that he, Tommy and several of the animals will sail away to search for the Great Pink Sea Snail as soon as they break the doctor out of jail. Emma begs Matthew to allow her to come along on the voyage as their cook. Matthew doesnt exactly approve, but he hints that if she were to stowaway he wouldn't know where to look for her. When she kisses him for the idea, he sings ""After Today."" He is confident that one little kiss will change his life.On the day the doctor is being transferred to a police wagon to take him to the asylum, Polynesia talks the horses into running away before the policemen board. She also convinces the police horses to buck and rear allowing the wagon to get away. Chee-Chee steals the keys to the police wagon so it can be unlocked to free Dr. Dolittle.In the next scene, their ship, the Flounder, is at sea. Dolittle quickly discovers that Emma is on board and has prepared a vegetarian meal, seaweed pie, for them. When Dolittle objects to having a woman on the voyage, Emma assures him that she expects to be treated as one of the crew... and, as a matter of fact, she often ends up with the hardest and dirtiest jobs. During dinner, Emma asks where they are going. Dolittle explains that he randomly sticks a pin into any page of the map and they simply end up there. Emma can't believe their destination is determined so haphazardly. She begs the doctor to take them to exotic locations in the song ""Fabulous Places."" Matthew, who is still infatuated with Fred, also joins her in the song. Their protests are in vain. At the end of the song, Emma drops the pin on the map; it lands on the tiny Sea-Star Island, a floating island. During a fierce storm, the Flounder is torn apart. Dolittle, Matthew and Tom are floating on separate parts of the wreckage, but they have no idea if Emma is safe. As if it were planned, the Sea-Star Island comes floating by, so Dolittle talks a porpoise into pulling him on shore, while Matthew and Tommy paddle their parts of the wreckage. Shortly after they reach shore, Tom and Matthew leave to search the island for Emma. While they are gone, she walks out of the woods onto the beach dressed in her under garments (all of her dresses were lost in the storm). Dolittle and Emma both seem to realize they are mutually attracted to each other and express their feelings in the song ""I Think I Like You."" Suddenly, Emma and John are taken captive by a group of savages. They are taken to the village and are tied up in a hut where Matthew and Tom are similarly captive. Dolittle talks some mice into chewing through the ropes that bind him and he unties the others. When he looks outside, Dolittle discovers frost; the island has been blown off course by the storm. When the chief of the tribe comes to the hut, the doctor says, ""Hello. Me Doctor Dolittle. Here little boy, late for school, here very cold. They all go home Puddleby, yes?"" And in perfect English, the chief replies, ""What a funny accent."" The chief's name is William Shakespeare, the Tenth. He explains that they name their children after their favorite authors. Lots of ships have wrecked on the island and they have collected numerous books and treasures and have become quite educated and civilized. However, they do have some strange laws, such as the person who brings winter must die - meaning Dolittle. The doctor quickly learns that the climate change has caused health problems for the other living things on Sea-Star Island, so he, of course, doctors them. The chief, who is known as Willie, is impressed by Dolittle's healing powers, so the death sentence is lifted. Dolittle then gets the idea to ask a blue whale to push the island back on course, but when the island begins to move, a revered balanced stone falls into a volcanic crater. Disturbing the balanced stone also carries a death sentence. Just before that sentence is carried out, the whale pushes the island back into the African mainland where it belongs. Once again, the death sentence is lifted. Dr. Dolittle resumes his task of treating the island's creatures. When several of the island's children gather, Matthew, Tommy and Polynesia sing ""Doctor Dolittle"" to welcome the children to the doctor's wonderful world where crocodiles talk and elephants sing. After the song, they hear an unusual noise. The sound is the Great Pink Sea Snail sneezing. Dr. Dolittle concocts a tonic for the snail and in gratitude it offers to transport them back to England. Since the snail's shell is watertight and has room for several passengers, Dolittle sends Matthew, Tommy, Emma and his animals back, but decides to stay behind on the island since he would be sent to the asylum if he returned. During his goodbye to Emma, Dolittle tells her he plans to explore the moon on the Giant Lunar Moth. Emma wants to remain with Dolittle, but finally kisses him goodbye and tells him she will miss him. Once she gets inside the shell and the snail sails away, she starts to cry. A little while later, Sophie, the seal, and her husband turn up at the Sea-Star Island. She tells Dolittle that the animals of England have gone on strike until he is allowed to return and the authorities are anxious for him to come back. The doctor quickly constructs a saddle and arranges for the Giant Lunar Moth to fly him back home that very evening. As the film ends with Dr. Dolittle astride the huge insect, a chorus sings a reprise of ""My Friend the Doctor.""","
    
                    Doctor Dolittle is a world-renowned veterinarian who speaks a wide array of animal languages. He sets off from his home in Puddleby-on-the-Marsh, England, in search of the Great Pink Sea Snail. In so doing, he and his friends meet such exotic creatures as the Pushme-Pullyu and the Giant Lunar Moth.

Instead of meat, he eats such things as apple cores, plain brown bread and drinks parsnip juice. He admits, however, that the sausages look very good and begins to waver in his conviction. At that point, he calls such things as turnip pie and peanuts filth and rubbish and proclaims: ""I'm a cheat! I love meat!"" However, when he hears Gub-Gub, the pig, squeal, he returns to being a reluctant but sincere vegetarian. When Tommy asks how he became a veterinarian, Dolittle explains that his sister, Sarah, started it all. At that point, the film flashes back to an earlier time when Dolittle was a human doctor and his sister was his house keeper. Sarah complains when her brother brings animals into the house and gives them sleeping space all over the inside of their home. Presently, Lady Petherington arrives to see the doctor. Her nerves are frayed because during a dinner party the previous evening a mouse had scampered across her table. While she is explaining this to the doctor, little white mice are crawling on her chair and onto her enormous bonnet. Soon the village's Vicar arrives with a terrible sneeze. He explains to Sarah that the Bishop is coming to visit and the Vicar needs to be in good health when he arrives. Then the village Magistrate, General Bellowes, arrives with a bandaged foot. Suddenly, Lady Petherington screams and runs from the doctor's office. Her screams cause other accidents that cause more problems for the Vicar and Bellowes. By the time they all leave, Sarah presents an ultimatum to her brother: either the animals go or she goes. Dolittle chooses the latter option. Later that evening when Matthew stops by for a friendly visit, Dolittle is despondent. He admits to Matthew that he is not a good doctor because he really doesn't care about his patients. He doesnt have anything in common with the human race. From its perch, Polynesia says, ""Be an animal doctor."" Dolittle immediately likes the suggestion. After all, he says, there's not one good animal doctor in the west of England. When he learns that Polynesia, a 199-year-old parrot, speaks 2,000 animal languages, he asks if he could I learn to talk to animals? The parrot assures the kindly doctor that he could and that she will teach him. Dr. Dolittle is so keen on this idea that he expresses his feelings in ""Talk to the Animals."" Later, Matthew, Tommy and Polynesia join the doctor in the song. During the song, Dolittle goes to bed still thinking about all the animal languages he can learn so he can speak to each animal when he encounters them. In the morning, he is still awake and continuing to sing (in his mind). Once he dresses for the day and goes downstairs, Polynesia helps him say good morning to Gub-Gub, the pig, by combining sounds with foot and leg movements. The doctor is so excited with his success in communicating with the pig that he informs Polynesia that he wants to say good morning to every animal in Puddleby (and the song continues as they greet various animals). After the song, the film returns to 1845. Dr. Dolittle informs Tommy that he has learned 498 animal languages. The doctor is reminded that he'll need more than languages if he intends to search for the Great Pink Sea Snail. He'll also need lots of money. One of Dr. Dolittle's patients is a short sighted horse, which he furnishes with gigantic glasses. However, the horse's owner, General Bellowes, bursts into the doctor's office and accuses the doctor of being a horse thief. A mother fox and her babies get extremely nervous at the sight of Bellowes; he has been hunting foxes lately and has chased the mother. When the mother fox runs away, the horse bolts and runs out of the office too. Bellowes chases them , but is foiled by some skunks. Dolittle explains to Tom and Matthew that he imported the skunks from America to help protect the foxes. He assigns each skunk to a fox to disguise their smell from the foxhounds. Emma Fairfax, Bellowes' niece, had accompanied her uncle to Dolittle's office. She chides the doctor for his irresponsibility and rudeness to her Uncle. She would like to be a man so she could take revenge. For her feistiness, Matthew gives her the nickname ""Fred."" Her horse had been spooked by the skunks, so she is forced to walk home. During her walk across the countryside and through streams, Emma sings ""At the Crossroads."" In the lyrics, she admits that her life is not the one she intended to lead. Later, Dolittle and his friends find a huge package in his yard. When they open it they discover a two-headed llama-type creature from Tibet, the Pushmi-Pullyu. A picture message from Dolittle's friend, Long Arrow, accompanied the package; the message encouraged Dolittle to use the Pushmi-Pullyu to make the money necessary for the voyage to search for the Great Pink Sea Snail. Matthew, Tommy and Dolittle take the creature to a nearby circus owned by Albert Blossom. Once Blossom sees the creature, he is so excited he sings ""I've Never Seen Anything Like It."" He calls all the circus performers out to see this amazing animal. Dr. Dolittle sings about the Pushmi-Pullyu's dance ability and he and the creature demonstrate with a minuet-type dance. Once Blossom agrees to share the profits, he and Dolittle finally agree on a deal. The Pushmi-Pullyu becomes the star attraction of the Dolittle and Blossom Circus and crowds flock to see the creature dance. Emma is seen among those in the audience. Later, Emma comes to the circus to complain about Dolittle exploiting the animals, but Matthew defends his friend. Matthew, who is infatuated with ""Fred,"" attempts to help her understand by singing ""Beautiful Things."" He sings that our lives are full of beautiful things. By the end of the song, Emma seems to have changed her mind about the doctor. When the circus seal can't catch the ball thrown by his handler, Dr. Dolittle befriends the seal named Sophie and discovers that she misses her husband who is at the North Pole. Dolittle decides to take her to the Bristol Channel so she can swim to her husband. That night he sneaks her out of the circus dressed as a baby in a pram (perambulator). Once it is daylight, he dresses the seal in a woman's hat and clock he took from a tavern, so they can catch the coach to Bristol. When the road is blocked by police a few miles from Bristol, Dolittle and the seal transfer to a hay wagon. Once the driver stops, Dolittle talks to the horses into delivering the seal and the doctor to the rocky Bristol Channel shoreline. Just before he helps the seal into the sea, Dolittle sings ""When I Look Into Your Eyes."" Dolittle kisses Sophie goodbye and tosses her into the ocean still in the lady's clothing. When he turns around, two men are standing there; they think he has thrown a woman into the water, so he is hauled off to court.
Unfortunately, the Magistrate for Dolittle's hearing is General Bellowes (Emma is seen in the court room). Of course, everyone thinks Dolittle is daft when he claims the seal asked him to help her get to her husband. The Doctor attempts to prove his ability to talk to animals by staging a conversation with Bellowes' Great Dane, Rufus. When Dolittle translates the dogs report of the gigantic dinner the General consumed the previous evening, Bellowes takes offense and dismisses the court until the following day. When Tommy and Matthew visit the doctor in his cell, Emma brings Tom and Matthew dinner and tells Dolittle that Rufus was correct about her Uncle's meal. The next day, the General announces that Dr. Dolittle has been acquitted, because the lady who owned the stolen clothes refused to prosecute (there seems to be some indication that the lady is Sarah, Dolittle's estranged sister), however, the General and a couple of other judges agree that Dr. Dolittle's talking to animals necessitates his being committed to an asylum. As his last speech before being taken away, Dolittle sings a clever song, ""Like Animals."" The doctor admits to not understanding the human race and accuses people of inhumane treatment of animals. He also abhors human phrases like ""treat him like a dog,"" ""working like a horse"" and ""eating like a hog"" (when we mean ""eating like a man""). He also complains that we call a hoodlum a weasel or a rat and a woman of ill-repute a vixen or a cat. He chides the women in the courtroom for wearing furs by asking them if they ever thought they were wearing someone's brother or mother. After his song, Dr. Dolittle is escorted to the jail awaiting transfer to the asylum. Matthew and Tommy plot to break their friend out, but Emma is skeptical that their plan will work. Matthew tells her that he, Tommy and several of the animals will sail away to search for the Great Pink Sea Snail as soon as they break the doctor out of jail. Emma begs Matthew to allow her to come along on the voyage as their cook. Matthew doesnt exactly approve, but he hints that if she were to stowaway he wouldn't know where to look for her. When she kisses him for the idea, he sings ""After Today."" He is confident that one little kiss will change his life.
On the day the doctor is being transferred to a police wagon to take him to the asylum, Polynesia talks the horses into running away before the policemen board. She also convinces the police horses to buck and rear allowing the wagon to get away. Chee-Chee steals the keys to the police wagon so it can be unlocked to free Dr. Dolittle.
In the next scene, their ship, the Flounder, is at sea. Dolittle quickly discovers that Emma is on board and has prepared a vegetarian meal, seaweed pie, for them. When Dolittle objects to having a woman on the voyage, Emma assures him that she expects to be treated as one of the crew... and, as a matter of fact, she often ends up with the hardest and dirtiest jobs. During dinner, Emma asks where they are going. Dolittle explains that he randomly sticks a pin into any page of the map and they simply end up there. Emma can't believe their destination is determined so haphazardly. She begs the doctor to take them to exotic locations in the song ""Fabulous Places."" Matthew, who is still infatuated with Fred, also joins her in the song. Their protests are in vain. At the end of the song, Emma drops the pin on the map; it lands on the tiny Sea-Star Island, a floating island. During a fierce storm, the Flounder is torn apart. Dolittle, Matthew and Tom are floating on separate parts of the wreckage, but they have no idea if Emma is safe. As if it were planned, the Sea-Star Island comes floating by, so Dolittle talks a porpoise into pulling him on shore, while Matthew and Tommy paddle their parts of the wreckage. Shortly after they reach shore, Tom and Matthew leave to search the island for Emma. While they are gone, she walks out of the woods onto the beach dressed in her under garments (all of her dresses were lost in the storm). Dolittle and Emma both seem to realize they are mutually attracted to each other and express their feelings in the song ""I Think I Like You."" Suddenly, Emma and John are taken captive by a group of savages. They are taken to the village and are tied up in a hut where Matthew and Tom are similarly captive. Dolittle talks some mice into chewing through the ropes that bind him and he unties the others. When he looks outside, Dolittle discovers frost; the island has been blown off course by the storm. When the chief of the tribe comes to the hut, the doctor says, ""Hello. Me Doctor Dolittle. Here little boy, late for school, here very cold. They all go home Puddleby, yes?"" And in perfect English, the chief replies, ""What a funny accent."" The chief's name is William Shakespeare, the Tenth. He explains that they name their children after their favorite authors. Lots of ships have wrecked on the island and they have collected numerous books and treasures and have become quite educated and civilized. However, they do have some strange laws, such as the person who brings winter must die - meaning Dolittle. The doctor quickly learns that the climate change has caused health problems for the other living things on Sea-Star Island, so he, of course, doctors them. The chief, who is known as Willie, is impressed by Dolittle's healing powers, so the death sentence is lifted. Dolittle then gets the idea to ask a blue whale to push the island back on course, but when the island begins to move, a revered balanced stone falls into a volcanic crater. Disturbing the balanced stone also carries a death sentence. Just before that sentence is carried out, the whale pushes the island back into the African mainland where it belongs. Once again, the death sentence is lifted. Dr. Dolittle resumes his task of treating the island's creatures. When several of the island's children gather, Matthew, Tommy and Polynesia sing ""Doctor Dolittle"" to welcome the children to the doctor's wonderful world where crocodiles talk and elephants sing. After the song, they hear an unusual noise. The sound is the Great Pink Sea Snail sneezing. Dr. Dolittle concocts a tonic for the snail and in gratitude it offers to transport them back to England. Since the snail's shell is watertight and has room for several passengers, Dolittle sends Matthew, Tommy, Emma and his animals back, but decides to stay behind on the island since he would be sent to the asylum if he returned. During his goodbye to Emma, Dolittle tells her he plans to explore the moon on the Giant Lunar Moth. Emma wants to remain with Dolittle, but finally kisses him goodbye and tells him she will miss him. Once she gets inside the shell and the snail sails away, she starts to cry. A little while later, Sophie, the seal, and her husband turn up at the Sea-Star Island. She tells Dolittle that the animals of England have gone on strike until he is allowed to return and the authorities are anxious for him to come back. The doctor quickly constructs a saddle and arranges for the Giant Lunar Moth to fly him back home that very evening. As the film ends with Dr. Dolittle astride the huge insect, a chorus sings a reprise of ""My Friend the Doctor.""

"26","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061439/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","During the opening credits, like the Broadway production, the studio orchestra plays a potpourri overture that features the ""Camelot March"" and the title song. The action begins in early morning darkness as a chorus sings a few lines from ""Guenevere."" Arthur (Richard Harris) talks to his unseen teacher, Merlyn (Laurence Naismith), asking him why everything that has happened to them happened. Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur ""Wart."" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings ""I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?"" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (""Camelot March"") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings ""The Simple Joys of Maidenhood."" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and ""kith not kill their kin"" for her. The procession halts for a rest so the royal hairdresser can prepare Guenevere to meet her mate. While everyone is busy, Guenevere sneaks away into the woods. She kneels in the snow and prays (sings) to St. Genevieve, her patron saint. Arthur, who is listening from a nearby tree, steps on a rotten branch and falls to the ground. Startled, Guenevere starts to run away, but Arthur promises he won't harm her and asks her not to leave. When Guenevere expresses her reluctance to go through with this arranged marriage, Arthur claims Camelot is unique and in the song, ""Camelot,"" describes the joys of life in his kingdom, including an extremely equitable climate. He claims it is an excellent place to live happily forever. When some of Arthur's attendants and Guenevere's entourage find them, Guenevere is shocked to discover that Wart is the King. Once all the attendants withdraw, Arthur tells Guenevere the story of how, at the age of eighteen, he pulled the sword from the stone and became king. He admits he never wanted to be king, but when he saw her for the first time, he wanted to be the wisest, most heroic, most splendid king who ever sat on any throne. Arthur offers to find someone to accompany her back home, but she slowly and tenderly sings a short reprise of ""Camelot,"" which was her way of agreeing to marry him. As they enter the city, a chorus sings a reprise of the song, which continues through their wedding ceremony.Four years later, Arthur laments to Jenny that England is made up of a mess of ill-begotten kingdoms ruled by immoral lords. He tells her that might shouldn't always mean right. After a considerable amount of thinking to himself and talking to Jenny, Arthur formulates the idea of creating a new order of chivalry where might is only used for right. Jenny is skeptical that knights would ever agree to do peaceful things, so Arthur decides to make it a great honor to be in the order. To avoid jealousies and superiority, Arthur further decides to use a round table so there is no head. Then in a reprise of the melody of ""Camelot,"" Arthur and Guenevere sing about spreading the word of this new order of knighthood. As the song continues to play in the orchestra, heralds and carrier pigeons are dispatched to carry the news.Soon the first recruits arrive at Camelot. When news of Arthur's new knighthood order reaches France, Lancelot du Lac sings a short reprise of ""Camelot"" from his castle walls as he fervently anticipates going to England to join Arthurs order. That short reprise segues into the song ""C'est Moi!"" Lancelot, who is far from modest, intends to use his considerable invincibility to serve the Round Table. He claims to be so pure, so godly, that if he had been Eve's partner they would still be in Eden. During the song he embarks on his journey to England. When he nears Arthur's castle, he dismounts, kneels and praises Arthur for creating a new order of life.Suddenly, a horseman rides by so closely that Lancelot topples over. He quickly gets up and challenges the horseman to a fight and knocks him off his horse; it is King Arthur. Once Lancelot realizes that he almost killed the King, he begs Arthur's forgiveness, but Arthur congratulates Lancelot for his fighting skills. Arthur wants to knight him immediately, but Lancelot begs to be allowed to prove himself first. A bit embarrassed, Arthur tells Lancelot that since it is the beginning of May the Queen and the Court have ""gone a-Maying."" Lancelot is incredulous that knights are doing such civilized things as attending picnics and gathering flowers.Guenevere and the Knights and Ladies of the Court are thoroughly enjoying the spring weather. In ""The Lusty Month of May,"" Guenevere recommends defiance of gentility in deference to giving in to ones amorous whims. The Knights and Ladies join her song and perform a spirited dance. At the end of the song, the revelers see an elderly man in rusty armor in the woods. He appears to be lost, so they offer assistance. The old man introduces himself as King Pellinore (Lionel Jeffries). He has mislaid his kingdom and can't find his way back. When Pellinore learns he is in Camelot, he remembers having spent a lovely day there years ago with a young lad name Wart. Guenevere informs Pellinore that Wart is now King Arthur of England and her husband. The Queen invites the old fellow to spend the night so he can see Arthur again. Pellinore quickly accepts; he hasn't slept in a bed since he left whatever the name of his kingdom was.Shortly after Pellinore leaves, Arthur arrives and introduces Guenevere to Lancelot. When the King asks Lancelot to explain some of the plans they have been discussing, Lancelot can't believe a woman would find the details of chivalry interesting. Guenevere assures him that she never tires of anything chivalrous. Lancelot proceeds to explain a training program for knights, but quickly points out that he would never expect any of the knights to live by his exalted standards of physical and spiritual perfection. When Lancelot claims to have achieved physical perfection, Guenevere doubts his boasts. She also questions his spiritual quest since he obviously has no humility.When Arthur and Lancelot depart, Guenevere begins to plot to have the three best jousters challenge Lancelot. The Queen sings ""Then You May Take Me to the Fair"" while she visits with Sir Lionel, Sir Sagramore and Sir Dinadan (Gary Marshal, Peter Bromilow, & Anthony Rogers respectively) individually to incite each of them to teach Lancelot a lesson. Pellinore doesn't trust anyone who doesn't drink, doesn't have a lady and talks to nobody but God and the King. He can hardly wait to see if the Frenchman's claims of physical prowess can withstand the three knights in the joust the next day. When Pellinore retires for the evening, Arthur discovers that the Queen has agreed to allow the three Knights to carry her kerchief in the tournament. Exasperated, he begs her to withdraw her permission, but she refuses unless he commands as King.When she exits, Arthur curses Merlyn for not teaching him how a ruler rules a Queen. He paces and sings ""How to Handle A Woman"" as he tries to remember Merlyn's advice pertaining to women. He finally remembers: ""The way to handle a woman is to love her."" The following day the jousting arena has a circus-like atmosphere. Lancelot easily defeats all three knights and appears to kill Sir Lionel with his jousting lance. Jenny rushes to Lionel's side. Lancelot cradles his defeated rival in his arms, weeps, bows his head in prayer and begs over and over again for the lifeless body to live. Suddenly, Lionel gasps for breath. Guenevere walks over to Lancelot and kneels before him with her hand over her heart, weeping over his rescue of her from the guilt of having caused Sir Lionel's death. Lancelot then kneels and kisses her hand. The look on Arthur's face suggests that he instinctively senses his wife's and Lancelot's mutual attraction. As Lancelot rises and walks away, the entire crowd kneels in homage to him for resurrecting Sir Lionel. The next few scenes show Guenevere sleeplessly thinking about Lancelot, Lancelot in torment as he thinks about Guenevere, and Arthur talking to Pellinore about being in love. When Lancelot comes to Jenny's room expecting to find Arthur, he can't hide his feelings for her and she confesses her feelings for him. Arthur interrupts when he arrives to inform Lancelot that he has proved himself worthy of being knighted.After a very regal knighting ceremony, Arthur walks into an adjacent room where he ponders what to do about the problem he senses. He readily admits that if he could choose any woman on earth, it would be Jenny. He also admits that if he could choose any man on earth as his brother, his son, or his friend, it would be Lancelot. He loves both of them, but he feels they must be punished for betraying his trust. At first, Arthur wants vengeance, but when his temper subsides, he realizes that it would not be civilized to destroy what he loves. He also begins to sense their pain and torment. Since they are both completely devoted to him and the Round Table, Arthur resolves that they will face whatever the future holds together. The Intermission comes at this point with Entracte music featuring an orchestral version of ""Camelot.""As the action commences again, Lancelot bests another knight in a sword fight. The defeated knight accuses him of having been the Queen's lover for years. Lance demands the knight defend his accusation, but the knight stands by his statement. Later, Lance and Jenny sneak into a secret garden for a clandestine meeting. Lance assures her that Arthur knows about them and, therefore, will never leave the castle without one of them with him. Lancelot realizes that he should leave at once and never return, but in ""If Ever I Would Leave You,"" he sings that the right moment never comes. Jenny feels a great deal of shame and guilt, but can't help remembering their past (while the orchestra plays more of the song, the film shows several significant scenes of their romance which apparently spans years; when Lancelot sings again, there are appropriate scenes for the seasons of the year that match the lyrics to the song). At the end of the song, they are back in the present and they embrace.Pellinore tells Arthur if he does not face the truth his Round Table is doomed (the King has been banishing every knight who accuses his wife and Lancelot of adultery). Suddenly, they are interrupted by a pompous young fellow named Mordred (David Hemmings). Arthur seems to be shaken when he learns the man's name because he realizes the young man is the son of a woman with whom he had a one-night stand, Queen Morgause of Orkney, making him Arthur's illegitimate son. Arthur invites Mordred to become a Knight of the Round Table, but the unpleasant youngster quickly admits to detesting swords, spears and horses and he is suspicious of virtues.Mordred has come to Camelot after discovering he is Arthur's bastard son in hopes of gaining the throne for himself. Lancelot advises Arthur that Mordred is trying to destroy the Round Table and is raising an army consisting of the banished knights, but the King is already aware of Mordred's deceitfulness. Lancelot wants to kill him, but Arthur forbids it. Arthur continues to hope that somehow he can make his only son worthy of the throne. After Lancelot leaves, Arthur tells Jenny he needs to talk about trivial things. This wish leads into the song ""What Do the Simple Folk Do?"" When Arthur says the simple folk find relief in whistling, he and Jenny try it, but quickly give up in frustration. Then when Arthur describes a young lad who sings when he is sad, they launch into a happy madrigal-style song. That doesn't work either. Next, Arthur says he had heard that the simple folk dance a fiery dance until their minds are blank. So they spin and twirl, but dancing is no more of a cure than whistling or singing. By the end of the dance they are distraught that these peasant remedies haven't work to relieve their strain Arthur can't escape the problems of ruling England and Guenevere can't forget Lancelot or abandon Arthur. In the following scene, Mordred's army arrives to battle the remaining Knights of the Round Table. During the fight, the Round Table itself is broken into pieces. Arthur and Lancelot watch helplessly in disbelief. Arthur leaves while the fight continues and goes into the legendary forest where Merlyn schooled him.The song ""Follow Me"" is sung by an off-screen chorus as the King rediscovers some of the woodland creatures that Merlyn had taught him about many years before. When he pretends to be Wart again, he imagines that Merlyn is there. Arthur and Wart, who is suddenly standing in front of Arthur, ask Merlyn for a remedy for sadness. Merlyn tells him (or them) to learn something. A little later, Merlyn turns Arthur (or Wart) into a fish and a hawk to help him learn (the film audience doesn't actually see a fish or a hawk). Arthur's lesson is interrupted by Mordred's arrival in the forest. Mordred continues his wickedness by slyly accusing the Queen and Lancelot of deception and infidelity. To test Lancelot's and Guenevere's loyalty, Mordred convinces Arthur to remain in the forest all night. Mordred returns to the court to tell them that Arthur will be hunting all night and will return by mid-morning the next day. Shortly after Mordred delivers his message, Lancelot visits Guenevere in her chambers and begs her to go away with him. Even though she loves Lancelot, the Queen still loves Arthur and is determined to stay with him as long as he wants her. Under those circumstances, Lancelot promises never to ask her to leave again and promises to never come to her again. Jenny similarly swears and she and Lancelot sing ""I Loved You Once in Silence."" As the song concludes, they kiss and walk together wrapped in each other's arms.Mordred and several knights confront them and accuse them of treason. Lancelot manages to escape, but Guenevere is captured. As Lancelot rides away, he encounters Arthur, who is attempting to return to the castle before something happens. Arthur immediately senses the truth and Lancelot covers his face in shame. When Arthur returns to the castle, he stands by helplessly as Guenevere is lead away to prison. An unseen chorus sings ""Guenevere,"" which narrates what happens in her trial and sentencing to be burned at the stake. As preparations for her sentence are being carried out, the chorus questions if Lancelot will be able to save her. Early in the morning Guenevere is marched to the stake. Everyone except Mordred hopes for her rescue. Mordred, on the other hand, mocks Arthur by saying, ""Let her die, your life is over. Let her live, your life's a fraud. Kill the Queen or kill the law.""Just as the fire is touched to the wood, Lancelot and the knights of the Joyous Gard arrive. Arthur is tremendously relieved! Mordred is pleased to see Lancelot and his troops slaughtering Arthur's knights. Lancelot rescues Guenevere and heads for the channel to take her to France. Lance sends a note asking Arthur to meet him in the forest at sunup (this section returns to the film's opening when Arthur is in pre-dawn darkness). Lancelot and Guenevere offer to return to England to face their punishment, but Arthur will not allow Guenevere to be burned at the stake or Lancelot to be beheaded. Instead, he urges Lance to take Jenny to Joyous Gard where she will be safe. Lancelot informs him that she has joined a convent. Arthur bids them goodbye, and seems to have forgiven them.As Arthur returns to his camp to prepare for battle, he encounters a young boy named Tom - the future Sir Thomas Malory, who really existed and who wrote ""L'Morte d'Arthur"", the definitive text on the King Arthur legend in 1471. The boy has only heard stories of the Knights of the Round Table, but those tales have inspired him to want to become a knight. Arthur is encouraged that the ideals of Camelot and the Round Table live on in this young lad. So he orders the lad to return to England to perpetuate the ideals of chivalry and tell future generations that once there was ""a fleeting wisp of glory called Camelot"" (Arthur sings his orders in a reprise of ""Camelot""). When Pellinore arrives with Arthur's sword, Excalibur, Arthur knights Tom and orders him to return home and carry out his orders. Arthur feels victorious. What he accomplished with the Knights of the Round Table and his civilized government will be remembered. As the closing credits scroll across the screen, a chorus sings a climactic reprise of ""Camelot."" The Exit Music consists of an instrumental version of ""Camelot.""","

            The synopsis below may give away important plot points.
    
    Synopsis
    During the opening credits, like the Broadway production, the studio orchestra plays a potpourri overture that features the ""Camelot March"" and the title song. The action begins in early morning darkness as a chorus sings a few lines from ""Guenevere."" Arthur (Richard Harris) talks to his unseen teacher, Merlyn (Laurence Naismith), asking him why everything that has happened to them happened. Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur ""Wart."" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings ""I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?"" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (""Camelot March"") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings ""The Simple Joys of Maidenhood."" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and ""kith not kill their kin"" for her. The procession halts for a rest so the royal hairdresser can prepare Guenevere to meet her mate. While everyone is busy, Guenevere sneaks away into the woods. She kneels in the snow and prays (sings) to St. Genevieve, her patron saint. Arthur, who is listening from a nearby tree, steps on a rotten branch and falls to the ground. Startled, Guenevere starts to run away, but Arthur promises he won't harm her and asks her not to leave. When Guenevere expresses her reluctance to go through with this arranged marriage, Arthur claims Camelot is unique and in the song, ""Camelot,"" describes the joys of life in his kingdom, including an extremely equitable climate. He claims it is an excellent place to live happily forever. When some of Arthur's attendants and Guenevere's entourage find them, Guenevere is shocked to discover that Wart is the King. Once all the attendants withdraw, Arthur tells Guenevere the story of how, at the age of eighteen, he pulled the sword from the stone and became king. He admits he never wanted to be king, but when he saw her for the first time, he wanted to be the wisest, most heroic, most splendid king who ever sat on any throne. Arthur offers to find someone to accompany her back home, but she slowly and tenderly sings a short reprise of ""Camelot,"" which was her way of agreeing to marry him. As they enter the city, a chorus sings a reprise of the song, which continues through their wedding ceremony.Four years later, Arthur laments to Jenny that England is made up of a mess of ill-begotten kingdoms ruled by immoral lords. He tells her that might shouldn't always mean right. After a considerable amount of thinking to himself and talking to Jenny, Arthur formulates the idea of creating a new order of chivalry where might is only used for right. Jenny is skeptical that knights would ever agree to do peaceful things, so Arthur decides to make it a great honor to be in the order. To avoid jealousies and superiority, Arthur further decides to use a round table so there is no head. Then in a reprise of the melody of ""Camelot,"" Arthur and Guenevere sing about spreading the word of this new order of knighthood. As the song continues to play in the orchestra, heralds and carrier pigeons are dispatched to carry the news.Soon the first recruits arrive at Camelot. When news of Arthur's new knighthood order reaches France, Lancelot du Lac sings a short reprise of ""Camelot"" from his castle walls as he fervently anticipates going to England to join Arthurs order. That short reprise segues into the song ""C'est Moi!"" Lancelot, who is far from modest, intends to use his considerable invincibility to serve the Round Table. He claims to be so pure, so godly, that if he had been Eve's partner they would still be in Eden. During the song he embarks on his journey to England. When he nears Arthur's castle, he dismounts, kneels and praises Arthur for creating a new order of life.Suddenly, a horseman rides by so closely that Lancelot topples over. He quickly gets up and challenges the horseman to a fight and knocks him off his horse; it is King Arthur. Once Lancelot realizes that he almost killed the King, he begs Arthur's forgiveness, but Arthur congratulates Lancelot for his fighting skills. Arthur wants to knight him immediately, but Lancelot begs to be allowed to prove himself first. A bit embarrassed, Arthur tells Lancelot that since it is the beginning of May the Queen and the Court have ""gone a-Maying."" Lancelot is incredulous that knights are doing such civilized things as attending picnics and gathering flowers.Guenevere and the Knights and Ladies of the Court are thoroughly enjoying the spring weather. In ""The Lusty Month of May,"" Guenevere recommends defiance of gentility in deference to giving in to ones amorous whims. The Knights and Ladies join her song and perform a spirited dance. At the end of the song, the revelers see an elderly man in rusty armor in the woods. He appears to be lost, so they offer assistance. The old man introduces himself as King Pellinore (Lionel Jeffries). He has mislaid his kingdom and can't find his way back. When Pellinore learns he is in Camelot, he remembers having spent a lovely day there years ago with a young lad name Wart. Guenevere informs Pellinore that Wart is now King Arthur of England and her husband. The Queen invites the old fellow to spend the night so he can see Arthur again. Pellinore quickly accepts; he hasn't slept in a bed since he left whatever the name of his kingdom was.Shortly after Pellinore leaves, Arthur arrives and introduces Guenevere to Lancelot. When the King asks Lancelot to explain some of the plans they have been discussing, Lancelot can't believe a woman would find the details of chivalry interesting. Guenevere assures him that she never tires of anything chivalrous. Lancelot proceeds to explain a training program for knights, but quickly points out that he would never expect any of the knights to live by his exalted standards of physical and spiritual perfection. When Lancelot claims to have achieved physical perfection, Guenevere doubts his boasts. She also questions his spiritual quest since he obviously has no humility.When Arthur and Lancelot depart, Guenevere begins to plot to have the three best jousters challenge Lancelot. The Queen sings ""Then You May Take Me to the Fair"" while she visits with Sir Lionel, Sir Sagramore and Sir Dinadan (Gary Marshal, Peter Bromilow, & Anthony Rogers respectively) individually to incite each of them to teach Lancelot a lesson. Pellinore doesn't trust anyone who doesn't drink, doesn't have a lady and talks to nobody but God and the King. He can hardly wait to see if the Frenchman's claims of physical prowess can withstand the three knights in the joust the next day. When Pellinore retires for the evening, Arthur discovers that the Queen has agreed to allow the three Knights to carry her kerchief in the tournament. Exasperated, he begs her to withdraw her permission, but she refuses unless he commands as King.When she exits, Arthur curses Merlyn for not teaching him how a ruler rules a Queen. He paces and sings ""How to Handle A Woman"" as he tries to remember Merlyn's advice pertaining to women. He finally remembers: ""The way to handle a woman is to love her."" The following day the jousting arena has a circus-like atmosphere. Lancelot easily defeats all three knights and appears to kill Sir Lionel with his jousting lance. Jenny rushes to Lionel's side. Lancelot cradles his defeated rival in his arms, weeps, bows his head in prayer and begs over and over again for the lifeless body to live. Suddenly, Lionel gasps for breath. Guenevere walks over to Lancelot and kneels before him with her hand over her heart, weeping over his rescue of her from the guilt of having caused Sir Lionel's death. Lancelot then kneels and kisses her hand. The look on Arthur's face suggests that he instinctively senses his wife's and Lancelot's mutual attraction. As Lancelot rises and walks away, the entire crowd kneels in homage to him for resurrecting Sir Lionel. The next few scenes show Guenevere sleeplessly thinking about Lancelot, Lancelot in torment as he thinks about Guenevere, and Arthur talking to Pellinore about being in love. When Lancelot comes to Jenny's room expecting to find Arthur, he can't hide his feelings for her and she confesses her feelings for him. Arthur interrupts when he arrives to inform Lancelot that he has proved himself worthy of being knighted.After a very regal knighting ceremony, Arthur walks into an adjacent room where he ponders what to do about the problem he senses. He readily admits that if he could choose any woman on earth, it would be Jenny. He also admits that if he could choose any man on earth as his brother, his son, or his friend, it would be Lancelot. He loves both of them, but he feels they must be punished for betraying his trust. At first, Arthur wants vengeance, but when his temper subsides, he realizes that it would not be civilized to destroy what he loves. He also begins to sense their pain and torment. Since they are both completely devoted to him and the Round Table, Arthur resolves that they will face whatever the future holds together. The Intermission comes at this point with Entracte music featuring an orchestral version of ""Camelot.""As the action commences again, Lancelot bests another knight in a sword fight. The defeated knight accuses him of having been the Queen's lover for years. Lance demands the knight defend his accusation, but the knight stands by his statement. Later, Lance and Jenny sneak into a secret garden for a clandestine meeting. Lance assures her that Arthur knows about them and, therefore, will never leave the castle without one of them with him. Lancelot realizes that he should leave at once and never return, but in ""If Ever I Would Leave You,"" he sings that the right moment never comes. Jenny feels a great deal of shame and guilt, but can't help remembering their past (while the orchestra plays more of the song, the film shows several significant scenes of their romance which apparently spans years; when Lancelot sings again, there are appropriate scenes for the seasons of the year that match the lyrics to the song). At the end of the song, they are back in the present and they embrace.Pellinore tells Arthur if he does not face the truth his Round Table is doomed (the King has been banishing every knight who accuses his wife and Lancelot of adultery). Suddenly, they are interrupted by a pompous young fellow named Mordred (David Hemmings). Arthur seems to be shaken when he learns the man's name because he realizes the young man is the son of a woman with whom he had a one-night stand, Queen Morgause of Orkney, making him Arthur's illegitimate son. Arthur invites Mordred to become a Knight of the Round Table, but the unpleasant youngster quickly admits to detesting swords, spears and horses and he is suspicious of virtues.Mordred has come to Camelot after discovering he is Arthur's bastard son in hopes of gaining the throne for himself. Lancelot advises Arthur that Mordred is trying to destroy the Round Table and is raising an army consisting of the banished knights, but the King is already aware of Mordred's deceitfulness. Lancelot wants to kill him, but Arthur forbids it. Arthur continues to hope that somehow he can make his only son worthy of the throne. After Lancelot leaves, Arthur tells Jenny he needs to talk about trivial things. This wish leads into the song ""What Do the Simple Folk Do?"" When Arthur says the simple folk find relief in whistling, he and Jenny try it, but quickly give up in frustration. Then when Arthur describes a young lad who sings when he is sad, they launch into a happy madrigal-style song. That doesn't work either. Next, Arthur says he had heard that the simple folk dance a fiery dance until their minds are blank. So they spin and twirl, but dancing is no more of a cure than whistling or singing. By the end of the dance they are distraught that these peasant remedies haven't work to relieve their strain Arthur can't escape the problems of ruling England and Guenevere can't forget Lancelot or abandon Arthur. In the following scene, Mordred's army arrives to battle the remaining Knights of the Round Table. During the fight, the Round Table itself is broken into pieces. Arthur and Lancelot watch helplessly in disbelief. Arthur leaves while the fight continues and goes into the legendary forest where Merlyn schooled him.The song ""Follow Me"" is sung by an off-screen chorus as the King rediscovers some of the woodland creatures that Merlyn had taught him about many years before. When he pretends to be Wart again, he imagines that Merlyn is there. Arthur and Wart, who is suddenly standing in front of Arthur, ask Merlyn for a remedy for sadness. Merlyn tells him (or them) to learn something. A little later, Merlyn turns Arthur (or Wart) into a fish and a hawk to help him learn (the film audience doesn't actually see a fish or a hawk). Arthur's lesson is interrupted by Mordred's arrival in the forest. Mordred continues his wickedness by slyly accusing the Queen and Lancelot of deception and infidelity. To test Lancelot's and Guenevere's loyalty, Mordred convinces Arthur to remain in the forest all night. Mordred returns to the court to tell them that Arthur will be hunting all night and will return by mid-morning the next day. Shortly after Mordred delivers his message, Lancelot visits Guenevere in her chambers and begs her to go away with him. Even though she loves Lancelot, the Queen still loves Arthur and is determined to stay with him as long as he wants her. Under those circumstances, Lancelot promises never to ask her to leave again and promises to never come to her again. Jenny similarly swears and she and Lancelot sing ""I Loved You Once in Silence."" As the song concludes, they kiss and walk together wrapped in each other's arms.Mordred and several knights confront them and accuse them of treason. Lancelot manages to escape, but Guenevere is captured. As Lancelot rides away, he encounters Arthur, who is attempting to return to the castle before something happens. Arthur immediately senses the truth and Lancelot covers his face in shame. When Arthur returns to the castle, he stands by helplessly as Guenevere is lead away to prison. An unseen chorus sings ""Guenevere,"" which narrates what happens in her trial and sentencing to be burned at the stake. As preparations for her sentence are being carried out, the chorus questions if Lancelot will be able to save her. Early in the morning Guenevere is marched to the stake. Everyone except Mordred hopes for her rescue. Mordred, on the other hand, mocks Arthur by saying, ""Let her die, your life is over. Let her live, your life's a fraud. Kill the Queen or kill the law.""Just as the fire is touched to the wood, Lancelot and the knights of the Joyous Gard arrive. Arthur is tremendously relieved! Mordred is pleased to see Lancelot and his troops slaughtering Arthur's knights. Lancelot rescues Guenevere and heads for the channel to take her to France. Lance sends a note asking Arthur to meet him in the forest at sunup (this section returns to the film's opening when Arthur is in pre-dawn darkness). Lancelot and Guenevere offer to return to England to face their punishment, but Arthur will not allow Guenevere to be burned at the stake or Lancelot to be beheaded. Instead, he urges Lance to take Jenny to Joyous Gard where she will be safe. Lancelot informs him that she has joined a convent. Arthur bids them goodbye, and seems to have forgiven them.As Arthur returns to his camp to prepare for battle, he encounters a young boy named Tom - the future Sir Thomas Malory, who really existed and who wrote ""L'Morte d'Arthur"", the definitive text on the King Arthur legend in 1471. The boy has only heard stories of the Knights of the Round Table, but those tales have inspired him to want to become a knight. Arthur is encouraged that the ideals of Camelot and the Round Table live on in this young lad. So he orders the lad to return to England to perpetuate the ideals of chivalry and tell future generations that once there was ""a fleeting wisp of glory called Camelot"" (Arthur sings his orders in a reprise of ""Camelot""). When Pellinore arrives with Arthur's sword, Excalibur, Arthur knights Tom and orders him to return home and carry out his orders. Arthur feels victorious. What he accomplished with the Knights of the Round Table and his civilized government will be remembered. As the closing credits scroll across the screen, a chorus sings a climactic reprise of ""Camelot."" The Exit Music consists of an instrumental version of ""Camelot.""

                    Lena, aged twenty, wants to know all she can about life and reality. She collects information on everyone and everything, storing her findings in an enormous archive. She experiments with relationships, political activism, and meditation.

                    Under his production company Sandrews, forty-two year old filmmaker Vilgot Sjöman is planning to make a film starring his current girlfriend, twenty-two year old drama student, Lena Nyman. The plot outline of the movie, titled ""Lena on the Road"", is as follows. The lead character, also named Lena, is a socio-political activist, who espouses among other things social equality and pacifism. The small room in the flat she shares with her divorced father is crammed with items reflecting her views, most notably a portrait of Francisco Franco and a chalkboard on which she writes the number of days passed in the Spanish Civil War. When she is not protesting with her friends, she goes around Stockholm interviewing people - both those in authority as well as the average Joe and Jane - about their socio-political views on topics of importance to her. Upon a chance encounter at the framing shop where her father works, Lena is pursued by Börje, the two who enter into a sexual relationship. He is her twenty-fourth sexual partner, files which she has on all of them. Their relationship is passionate and stormy, the latter based on what Lena learns is his current relationship status with other women which he did not initially divulge to her. Lena's life is altered by her experiences with Börje. Similarly, through the process of making the movie, Lena, the actress, and Vilgot's own relationship is changed as a direct outcome.

                    In 1922 New York City, Millie Dillmount and Miss Dorothy Brown are just two of the girls living at the Priscilla Hotel for Single Young Ladies run by Mrs. Meers. Orphaned, Miss Dorothy, just recently arrived, is a naive, old-fashioned girl from a seemingly privileged background who has aspirations to be a stage actress. From more modest means, Millie, in New York for three months, used to be old fashioned, but now has a new modern sensibility and look to match, complete with bobbed hair and dresses with hemlines above the knee. Included in this new modern sensibility is Millie's goal of getting a job as a stenographer, with a quick promotion to being her wealthy boss' ""Mrs."". Love is not to factor into the equation. She believes she's found the right employer in the form of chisel-jawed Trevor Graydon of the Sincere Trust Insurance Company. Millie's pursuit of Mr. Graydon is despite the fact that Mr. Graydon sees her as one of the boys, he has old fashioned sensibilities, and Millie herself has a mutual attraction to another boy named Jimmy Smith. Although she likes Jimmy, Millie feels that Jimmy, as a paper clip salesman with an overwhelming happy-go-lucky attitude, is not driven enough to be husband material. That doesn't stop Jimmy's pursuit of Millie. In her association with Jimmy, Millie meets flamboyant wealthy Renaissance woman Muzzy Van Hossmere. Jimmy's father once worked as Muzzy's gardener. Originally from humble means much like Millie, Muzzy tries to convince Millie that true love will lead to happiness, as that is what happened when she met the now deceased Mr. Van Hossmere who she had no idea was rich. In other goings-on among this new circle of friends, Miss Dorothy leaves New York without a word to anyone except Mrs. Meers. Thinking this situation rather odd, Millie connects Miss Dorothy's leaving with that of other girls previously living at the Priscilla Hotel. With Mr. Graydon's help, Jimmy and Millie try to find out what happened to Miss Dorothy.

                    Will Penny, an aging cowpoke, takes a ""line-rider"" job on a vast cattle ranch requiring him to keep trespassers and squatters moving till they're off the property. Ironically, he discovers that the mountain cabin reserved for the line rider has been appropriated by Catherine Allen and her young son, Horace, whose guide has deserted them en route to Oregon to join Catherine's husband. Too soft-hearted and ashamed to kick mother and child out just as the bitter Rocky Mountains winter sets in, he agrees to share the cabin until the spring thaw. But it isn't just the snow that slowly thaws; lonely man and woman soon forget their considerable dissimilarities and start developing a deep, if awkward and unstated, love for each another. Beyond this, Horace finds in Will the father he's never known, and Will finds in Horace the son he's never known he's wanted. The trio's little refuge is then invaded by Bible-quoting Preacher Quint and his murderous family of ""rawhiders,"" who'd earlier nearly killed Will over an imagined insult, forcing Will to defend his own ""family.""

In 1944 Paris, this quartet is reunited and Major Grau continues his investigation.

Hans is in love with Christina (Susan Denberg), the disfigured daughter of a local innkeeper. Christina's father disapproves of their relationship because Hans's father was executed for murder -- an execution Hans witnessed as a young boy. One night, while visiting Christina at the inn, Hans fights with three upper class snobs -- Anton (Peter Blythe), Johann (Derek Folds) and Karl (Barry Warren) -- when they insult her. Later that night, the three snobs sneak back into the inn and assault Christina's father, killing him.Hans is arrested for the murder. Despite the sterling character references of Dr Hertz and Frankenstein, the testimony of Anton, Johann and Karl persuade the jury. Because Hans will not reveal his whereabouts during the time of the murder -- he was making love with Christina -- he is sentenced to die at the same guillotine that killed his father some twenty years earlier.Frankenstein sees this as an opportunity to test his new machinery on a human, and he has Dr Hertz arrange to receive Hans's dead body. Christina, unaware that Hans had been sentenced to death, stumbles upon the execution site and sees Hans die. Distraught, she throws herself off a bridge and drowns. Frankenstein and Hertz successfully trap Hans' soul. The authorities bring Christina to Dr Hertz's office. Frankenstein persuades Hertz to trap her soul; once they have healed her injuries and facial disfigurements, they will restore her soul to her body.The procedure is a success. At first Frankenstein refuses to reveal to Christina who she really he is or allow her to leave Hertz's house, but after a few weeks he takes her to see the guillotine. When Christina sees the device she cries out ""Papa!"" and faints. Frankenstein's suspicions are proven: both Hans's and Christina's souls are in her body. As Frankenstein devises more experiments, Hans's soul overtakes Christina's and urges her to avenge her father. She dresses up like a promiscuous woman, seduces Anton and Johann and kills them.Christina scrawls ""Hans"" in blood next to Johann's name, leading authorities to assume that Hans had sent someone else to the guillotine and had survived himself. They go to Hertz and Frankenstein, assuming their complicity. Frankenstein reveals the truth: Hans's soul is controlling Christina. He then tracks Christina to the woods where she has taken Karl for a picnic. He arrives too late: Christina has killed Karl and is now ""speaking"" with Hans's severed head which ""informs"" her that her work is done. Shocked at what she has done, Christina's soul resumes control and rushes to the river bank. Frankenstein promises to help her, but she cannot endure her guilt and throws herself to her second watery death. Frankenstein walks sadly away.","
    
                    A dead and frozen Baron Frankenstein is re-animated by his colleague Dr. Hertz proving to him that the soul does not leave the body on the instant of death. His lab assistant, young Hans, is found guilty of murdering the local pub owner with whom he had an argument where he foolishly swore to kill the man and Frankenstein acquires his body immediately after the execution. Hans had been quite friendly with the dead man's daughter Christina who returns just in time to see him guillotined. Distraught, she commits suicide and is brought back to life by the good Doctor but with Hans' brain replacing her own. As memories return to her - Hans' memories in fact - she sets out to pursue and kill those responsible for having sent him to his death.

    Synopsis
    Abetted by the elderly Dr. Hertz (Thorley Waters) and handyman Hans (Robert Morris), Baron Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) determines that the soul does not immediately leave the body upon death, and can be transplanted from one body to another with a special apparatus he has developed. Hans is in love with Christina (Susan Denberg), the disfigured daughter of a local innkeeper. Christina's father disapproves of their relationship because Hans's father was executed for murder -- an execution Hans witnessed as a young boy. One night, while visiting Christina at the inn, Hans fights with three upper class snobs -- Anton (Peter Blythe), Johann (Derek Folds) and Karl (Barry Warren) -- when they insult her. Later that night, the three snobs sneak back into the inn and assault Christina's father, killing him.Hans is arrested for the murder. Despite the sterling character references of Dr Hertz and Frankenstein, the testimony of Anton, Johann and Karl persuade the jury. Because Hans will not reveal his whereabouts during the time of the murder -- he was making love with Christina -- he is sentenced to die at the same guillotine that killed his father some twenty years earlier.Frankenstein sees this as an opportunity to test his new machinery on a human, and he has Dr Hertz arrange to receive Hans's dead body. Christina, unaware that Hans had been sentenced to death, stumbles upon the execution site and sees Hans die. Distraught, she throws herself off a bridge and drowns. Frankenstein and Hertz successfully trap Hans' soul. The authorities bring Christina to Dr Hertz's office. Frankenstein persuades Hertz to trap her soul; once they have healed her injuries and facial disfigurements, they will restore her soul to her body.The procedure is a success. At first Frankenstein refuses to reveal to Christina who she really he is or allow her to leave Hertz's house, but after a few weeks he takes her to see the guillotine. When Christina sees the device she cries out ""Papa!"" and faints. Frankenstein's suspicions are proven: both Hans's and Christina's souls are in her body. As Frankenstein devises more experiments, Hans's soul overtakes Christina's and urges her to avenge her father. She dresses up like a promiscuous woman, seduces Anton and Johann and kills them.Christina scrawls ""Hans"" in blood next to Johann's name, leading authorities to assume that Hans had sent someone else to the guillotine and had survived himself. They go to Hertz and Frankenstein, assuming their complicity. Frankenstein reveals the truth: Hans's soul is controlling Christina. He then tracks Christina to the woods where she has taken Karl for a picnic. He arrives too late: Christina has killed Karl and is now ""speaking"" with Hans's severed head which ""informs"" her that her work is done. Shocked at what she has done, Christina's soul resumes control and rushes to the river bank. Frankenstein promises to help her, but she cannot endure her guilt and throws herself to her second watery death. Frankenstein walks sadly away.

After learning that his father has signed him up for the space program, Roy reluctantly heads for Houston, only to find out upon arriving that his job is a janitor, not an astronaut. Anxious to live up to the expectations of his domineering father, Roy manages to keep up a facade of being an astronaut to his family and friends.

Roy works at a carnival operating a children's space capsule simulation ride, he acting as the astronaut. Being a real astronaut is as far away from Roy's reality as possible, as Roy is even afraid of heights, which includes not being able to fly in airplanes. Roy's father, Arbuckle Fleming, who only hears what he wants to hear, is a WWI US Army hero. Much to Roy's chagrin, Buck has dreams of Roy becoming a ""hero"" in his own right in the form of a real live astronaut, as demonstrated by he sending astronaut applications to the space program on Roy's behalf. Roy is horrified when his application has been accepted. Upon his arrival at the space center, Roy learns that the job for which he has been accepted is not as an astronaut trainee, but rather as a janitor. Roy has every intention of telling the truth to his family and friends - who also includes his somewhat ""girl"" back home, Ellie Jackson - but he doesn't have the heart to when he learns the truth behind why his father is so desperate for him to become a hero. Roy has to continue the ruse of being in astronaut training without being caught by those back home, in the process he getting into one misadventure after another. The Americans' space race with the Russians largely factors into what ultimately happens to Roy.

His focus changes from his friends when he meets a young woman on the Staten Island Ferry, she who rides the ferry just for something to do. His friends can tell and don't like that she is now preoccupying his thoughts. The two of them end up falling in love with each other. Although he wants to, he decides not to have sex with her until after they're married, as he only considers virgins to be wife material. Conversely, he negatively refers to unmarried women who have had sex ""broads"", with who he nonetheless has previously hooked up. Ultimately, she tells him of an incident from her past that was outside of her control. Not only the information of the story but his reaction to it leads to the question whether love is enough on either side for them to enter into a truly committed relationship that both truly want under the circumstances.

                    Twenty-seven year old New York window washer, J. Pierpont Finch, believes he can be a success in the corporate world after he impulsively picks up the book ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"". The book promises its reader that he can climb the corporate ladder simply and quickly. The Worldwide Wicket Corporation, the business in the office building whose windows he washes is, according to the book, the perfect type of business. There he meets secretary Rosemary Pilkington, who sees in Ponty (as she calls him) an unassuming man who she believes the corporate world will eat alive. But Ponty, memorizing what the book tells him, does quickly climb the corporate ladder but not by doing any real work. Ponty has a few obstacles along the way such as: Bud Frump who sees Ponty as a rival and is the nephew by marriage of the company president J.B. Biggley; Hedy La Rue, a curvaceous but simple woman who has a secret or not-so-secret tie to someone important in the company; Mr. Ovington, an executive who Ponty can't figure out; and Ponty possibly making a fatal error by not reading far enough ahead in the book. Ponty ultimately has to decide if climbing to the top of the ladder is worth stepping on all those along the way and risk losing the love of Rosemary. In the end telling the truth may set him free.

                    US Army Major Weldon Penderton is stationed on a base in the American south. He and his wife Leonora Penderton are in an unsatisfying marriage. Weldon is generally a solitary man who in his time alone tries to bolster his self image as he feels less than adequate as a man and a major. He does not want to viewed like Captain Murray Weincheck, who has been bypassed for promotion time and time again solely because he is seen as being too sensitive. Self absorbed Leonora, when not focused on her passion of horses and riding, tries to maintain the facade of being what she sees an officer's wife should be while she carries on an affair with their next door neighbor, married Colonel Morris Langdon. Morris' wife, Alison Langdon, suffered a nervous breakdown three years ago after miscarrying, she still with that nervous constitution. Alison is generally drawn toward sensitive types, such as Captain Weincheck and their faithful flamboyant Filipino houseboy, Anacleto. Peripheral to the Pendertons' lives is brooding Private Williams, who Leonora knows as the enlisted man who works at the stables, and who Weldon asks to do some work around their house. While Weldon secretly becomes fixated on Williams, Williams in turn becomes secretly fixated on Leonora. The question becomes what emotions, many of those emotions being latent, will dictate what actions each of these people will make.

They go out to the woods, leaving Penderton to exercise with his barbells. Pressure mounts within Penderton. The strain finally shows on Private Williams, as well. He provokes a fight in the barracks latrine. Unable to control his voyeur instincts any longer, he later gets up from bed, makes his way through a thunderstorm to the Penderton house and Leonora's bedroom. This time, standing by an upstairs window, Penderton sees him. He takes his pistol and shoots the young soldier as he squats by Leonora's sleeping body. The shot startles her awake; Langdon rushes across from his house.

Near the top of his game, his fortunes change when he encounters Misako, a mysterious, death-obsessed woman who brings him a particularly difficult mission. In a famous moment indicative of the film's eccentric sensibility, a butterfly lands on his gun's sight at the exact moment he pulls the trigger, causing him to miss the shot. This failure means that the killer becomes the target, and must run for his life from his former employers, and the mysterious ""No. 1 Killer."" While the film does contain some spectacular action sequences, the story is played less as a suspense thriller than as a surrealistic, psychosexual nightmare, filled with grotesque imagery and strange touches, from Hanada's fetish for the smell of boiling rice, to Misako's use of a dead bird's corpse as a rear-view mirror decoration.

"62","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061789/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","This film contains the memoirs of one Lt. Earnest Goodbody (Michael Crawford) of 3rd troop, 4th Musketeers--albeit presented to us via 2 perspectives.Early on in the film, the lieutenant is captured while attempting to cross the Rhine river and secure the last intact bridge for the Allies (having boarded an inflated raft by himself and been abandoned by his men). He intermittently recounts his story to a German officer (Karl Michael Vogler) while we, the viewing audience, are also treated to what really happened (seeing as he sugar-coats his version of the story).His earliest recollections are of his officer training under Lt. Colonel Grapple (Michael Hordern), who is shown to be as oblivious to the suffering of his charges as Goodbody proves to be. During the introduction of the story (and shortly thereafter), we meet the men under Goodbody's command:Transom--the unit's suffering second-in-command, who proves to be the only true, hard-working soldier in the group. He is reluctant to take charge of the situations they find themselves in but often does. He encourages the others to kill the Lieutenant and resists the temptation several times. Portrayed by Lee Montague.Dooley--the unit's third-in-command. While he and Transom start at the same rank in the beginning (Corporal), he seems more than willing to place most of the rank-induced responsibilities in the other man's hands. In fact, he acts more like a lackey to Transom than an equal. Portrayed by Ewan Hooper.Gripweed--the Lieutenant's batman (appointed personal assistant, as was common at the time in the British Army). He is a compulsive thief and admits to having been a former member of the British Fascist Party. He seems to show some naivete regarding the true nature of war and the incapabilities of his unit and often is found both chiding and being sycophantic towards Goodbody. Portrayed by then-Beatle John Lennon.Juniper--serves as both the unit's crusty old veteran and the would-be comic relief man. He appears more than willing to spur the rest of the group on to do things but is unwilling to do any real fighting. Throughout the film we see him appear in various comedic guises (such as a ventriloquist with a dummy and a clown). He is perceived by the others to be going insane and as the film progresses; he 'promotes' himself both in rank and as a master strategist (using medals taken from dead soldiers). Portrayed by Jack MacGowran.Clapper--the realist of the group. He is constantly harboring the belief that his wife is cheating on him back home (we find out, mere moments before his death, that she was merely making up stories based on the affairs a neighbor of theirs was having). While, like the rest of the unit, he has little respect for Goodbody, he goes to him for advice numerous times. He also endures the most criticism from Transom regarding his general appearance as a soldier (being told he's improperly dressed for merely having his shirt not buttoned right--although Juniper, standing next to him in the particular shot, is dressed as a clown). Portrayed by Roy Kinnear.Drogue--resigned to dying in North Africa (as he points out repeatedly), he is constantly willing off his possessions to other members of the unit. While he's one of the few to show some level of bravery in the film, he is also shown not to be too careful. Portrayed by James Cossins.Spool--the wireless radio operator for the unit (who never gets to do so). The only major fault that can be attributed to him is that he's probably the clumsiest member of the group (he immediately gets a splinter while holding a fake rifle during training and later sets Goodbody up for landing headfirst in a sand pit merely by knocking into him with a ladder). Portrayed by Ronald Lacey.The Melancholy Musketeer (real name not known, even to himself)--the resident coward of the group, who seems to be completely unaware of what he's fighting for, and why he signed up in the first place. He flees for cover in the middle of battle and at one point even abandons the group (only to be picked up later in the film having hidden in a German truck and claiming to have been captured). Portrayed by Jack Hedley.The unit's first assignment is to land behind enemy lines and set up an advance cricket pitch at an oasis. The purpose of the mission: to give Allied soldiers something to look forward to when they take that particular region. Any other unit would have felt disgraced to accept such a mission but Lt. Goodbody takes it with pride (fearing his men will die of boredom otherwise).The mission immediately is bungled when Goodbody accidentally orders signal rockets fired (giving away their position to a nearby German defense post). In the hustle to avoid being cratered, the unit loses half of their vehicles and Dooley is killed.In a twist of surrealism, each soldier that dies under the Lieutenant's command returns immediately after, replaced by a soldier painted to resemble a plastic army man. From Goodbody's perspective, that man is still alive. Footage shown during the death scenes of these characters is tinted a certain color for each incident (green, then pink, then red, then blue), and the dead soldier 'returns' in that color.With half of their vehicles gone and little fuel remaining, Goodbody decides to raid a German fuel dump on their way to the oasis. In spite of mounting excitement from some of the men (Transom and Goodbody, specifically, with Juniper doing a brief standup routine--during which the two others debate whether or not the man has lost his mind), the raid on the fuel dump ends predictably in failure, seeing as only 3 of the men are willing to advance on the outpost once it's realized that the Germans have heavy machine guns. Drogue is killed (foolishly walking out into the line of fire), and Goodbody is nearly killed in a one-on-one fight with an enemy soldier who is promptly killed by Transom with a bayonet. After the retreat, a light plane spots them and attacks. Goodbody ignores the hail of bullets flying around him to point out how to signal an oncoming plane (having mistaken the attacker for an Allied plane) and goes into a minor tantrum upon discovery that their roller full of water is missing. He spots a group of off-duty Italian soldiers playing soccer nearby (who, it should be pointed out, were on the Allies' side by this point) and immediately spouts racial slurs against them and accuses them of stealing their roller. While this is going on, Transom grabs a submachine gun and shoots down the plane--marking their 'first real victory' (as Goodbody puts it).In the ensuing explosion of the plane's wreckage, the Melancholy Musketeer panics and attempts to flee in one of their trucks. Juniper destroys it, leaving the Musketeer to flee with his pants on fire. The rest of the group carries on towards the oasis (eventually having to go on foot, with the dead versions of Drogue and Dooley carrying the water roller). The men stop near the edge of a cliff, only to find themselves in the middle of a minefield. Spool, going mad with dehydration and heat stress, runs to the roller for a drink and begins to throw a fit after the discovery that Gripweed had let the water out to make the roller easy to move. Goodbody ends up being the last one to find out about the mines (having started doing exercises near the edge of the cliff and discovered that the oasis is nearby). In the ensuing chaos, the film breaks the fourth wall and two ladies (played by the actresses who waved to the Beatles early in the film 'Help!') discuss a similar fit suffered by a son of one of the ladies (""He's not dead, they didn't get him. Missing. Turn up he will, missing he is..."").Colonel Grapple arrives moments later (using a jeep he had 'appropriated' from the unit earlier in the film) and gives them some water, and spurs them to carry on and take the oasis. In a lengthy 'death scene' (in which a man in plain clothes delivers a long-winded recount of a joke he gave to his men during the war), the men take the oasis seemingly without a real fight and while rounding up prisoners (the men whistling the theme to ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" all the while), a rifle lands butt-first on the ground, firing off a live round that strikes Spool in the head.While the men are setting up the cricket pitch (the ground is awfully uneven, forcing some of the men to use dynamite to blast open areas), the Melancholy Musketeer turns up having been hiding in an enemy truck at the oasis. Juniper berates him for cowardice, and in his 'rage,' he strikes the Musketeer, as well as Goodbody and Colonel Grapple. He is put on an immediate court martial (with the Musketeer as his appointed attorney) while the other men in the unit attempt to play cricket with the German captives looking on. Eventually, the General who gave them the assignment arrives with another high-ranking officer, who merely points out that the men are 'rotten bowlers.' Juniper hitches a ride with the officers as they leave (we last see him near the end of the film in a straightjacket with his stolen medals pinned on).During the intermissions of these scenes and the ones to come, Goodbody and Odlebog, the German officer, discuss their views on how the war should be fought and Odlebog is appalled to discover that Goodbody is a fascist at heart. The two men seem to have plenty in common (Odlebog seems to be somewhat negligent of his men, as well) in spite of their current circumstances.The flashbacks then take us to the Allied advance towards the Rhine river. Goodbody's men are among those tasked with making a foothold along the river. Goodbody accidentally shoots the Melancholy Musketeer in the foot, cutting his unit short by yet another man. While passing through a village, Gripweed steals a milk bottle while laughing hysterically, accidentally giving their position away to the nearby German forces. The remaining troops hole up in and around a German farmhouse but are forced to retreat as a tank approaches with infantry as support. Clapper is cornered by two enemy soldiers and stabbed with a bayonet (a bit of irony seeing as how Clapper had not taken a demonstration of bayonet use seriously earlier in the film). Gripweed discovers another British soldier holed up in a shelled out barn, looting a corpse. Gripweed derides the man and dismisses him as an amateur thief, but unfortunately is forced to run when German mortars start raining on the barn. As he crosses an open field, a mortar lands right in front of him, perforating him with shrapnel. He solemnly looks at the camera and says ""I knew this would happen. You knew it would happen, didn't you?""As Goodbody and Transom retreat, a German flamethrower operator nearly corners them. They kill the man and Transom flees as the enemy tank approaches. Goodbody yells for him to come back to their cover, and Transom is mowed down by a tank-mounted machine gun in the confusion (spouting regrets of not having killed the Lieutenant earlier in his last breaths).As we return to the present, Odlebog realizes that in spite of his orders to destroy the bridge, he feels it would be much better if he let Goodbody 'have' it as it would end the war and bring his retirement sooner. In what appears to be a slant against capitalism, the two negotiate a price and Goodbody writes him a check for it. Meanwhile, Grapple leads the push to the bridge in a tank and is the first to cross. He runs over Odlebog in the process, leaving Goodbody with a small piece of the cold, hard reality of war that he had missed all those times before (he then shows relief at not having to deal with a bad check as though he hadn't just lost a friend). He then addresses his 'men' (who are now merely just the replacmenets of the dead soldiers from before) with optimism over the inevitable end of World War II.The film ends with a post-war 'reunion' orchestrated by Goodbody, with the Melancholy Musketeer obviously being the only one who shows up. The Musketeer says there was a good reason for fighting, but Goodbody points out that HE had won the war.","
    
                    This film features former Beatle John Lennon and Roy Kinnear as ill-fated enlisted men in under the inept command of Lieutenant Earnest Goodbody. The story unwinds mostly in flashbacks of Lieutenant Goodbody who has lower-class beginnings and education which make him a poor officer who commands one of the worst units of the army.

His ""victory"" is despite the unfeeling power mongering of one of his superiors, Col. Grapple. As he tells the story of the primary mission he led of his Musketeers, the mission to construct a cricket field behind enemy lines in North Africa, his troop members - some no longer in the living - tell both of their own preoccupations with other things in life preventing them from being the best of soldiers, and of Goodbody's ineptitude. Some lament the fact that they didn't kill Goodbody when they had the chance. The actual telling of the story is due to Goodbody's troop being caught in a precarious situation in the Rhine Valley, from which Goodbody commandeers his way out of successfully. Are Goodbody's actions actually successful?

Throughout the film we see him appear in various comedic guises (such as a ventriloquist with a dummy and a clown). He is perceived by the others to be going insane and as the film progresses; he 'promotes' himself both in rank and as a master strategist (using medals taken from dead soldiers). Portrayed by Jack MacGowran.Clapper--the realist of the group. He is constantly harboring the belief that his wife is cheating on him back home (we find out, mere moments before his death, that she was merely making up stories based on the affairs a neighbor of theirs was having). While, like the rest of the unit, he has little respect for Goodbody, he goes to him for advice numerous times. He also endures the most criticism from Transom regarding his general appearance as a soldier (being told he's improperly dressed for merely having his shirt not buttoned right--although Juniper, standing next to him in the particular shot, is dressed as a clown). Portrayed by Roy Kinnear.Drogue--resigned to dying in North Africa (as he points out repeatedly), he is constantly willing off his possessions to other members of the unit. While he's one of the few to show some level of bravery in the film, he is also shown not to be too careful. Portrayed by James Cossins.Spool--the wireless radio operator for the unit (who never gets to do so). The only major fault that can be attributed to him is that he's probably the clumsiest member of the group (he immediately gets a splinter while holding a fake rifle during training and later sets Goodbody up for landing headfirst in a sand pit merely by knocking into him with a ladder). Portrayed by Ronald Lacey.The Melancholy Musketeer (real name not known, even to himself)--the resident coward of the group, who seems to be completely unaware of what he's fighting for, and why he signed up in the first place. He flees for cover in the middle of battle and at one point even abandons the group (only to be picked up later in the film having hidden in a German truck and claiming to have been captured). Portrayed by Jack Hedley.The unit's first assignment is to land behind enemy lines and set up an advance cricket pitch at an oasis. The purpose of the mission: to give Allied soldiers something to look forward to when they take that particular region. Any other unit would have felt disgraced to accept such a mission but Lt. Goodbody takes it with pride (fearing his men will die of boredom otherwise).The mission immediately is bungled when Goodbody accidentally orders signal rockets fired (giving away their position to a nearby German defense post). In the hustle to avoid being cratered, the unit loses half of their vehicles and Dooley is killed.In a twist of surrealism, each soldier that dies under the Lieutenant's command returns immediately after, replaced by a soldier painted to resemble a plastic army man. From Goodbody's perspective, that man is still alive. Footage shown during the death scenes of these characters is tinted a certain color for each incident (green, then pink, then red, then blue), and the dead soldier 'returns' in that color.With half of their vehicles gone and little fuel remaining, Goodbody decides to raid a German fuel dump on their way to the oasis. In spite of mounting excitement from some of the men (Transom and Goodbody, specifically, with Juniper doing a brief standup routine--during which the two others debate whether or not the man has lost his mind), the raid on the fuel dump ends predictably in failure, seeing as only 3 of the men are willing to advance on the outpost once it's realized that the Germans have heavy machine guns. Drogue is killed (foolishly walking out into the line of fire), and Goodbody is nearly killed in a one-on-one fight with an enemy soldier who is promptly killed by Transom with a bayonet. After the retreat, a light plane spots them and attacks. Goodbody ignores the hail of bullets flying around him to point out how to signal an oncoming plane (having mistaken the attacker for an Allied plane) and goes into a minor tantrum upon discovery that their roller full of water is missing. He spots a group of off-duty Italian soldiers playing soccer nearby (who, it should be pointed out, were on the Allies' side by this point) and immediately spouts racial slurs against them and accuses them of stealing their roller. While this is going on, Transom grabs a submachine gun and shoots down the plane--marking their 'first real victory' (as Goodbody puts it).In the ensuing explosion of the plane's wreckage, the Melancholy Musketeer panics and attempts to flee in one of their trucks. Juniper destroys it, leaving the Musketeer to flee with his pants on fire. The rest of the group carries on towards the oasis (eventually having to go on foot, with the dead versions of Drogue and Dooley carrying the water roller). The men stop near the edge of a cliff, only to find themselves in the middle of a minefield. Spool, going mad with dehydration and heat stress, runs to the roller for a drink and begins to throw a fit after the discovery that Gripweed had let the water out to make the roller easy to move. Goodbody ends up being the last one to find out about the mines (having started doing exercises near the edge of the cliff and discovered that the oasis is nearby). In the ensuing chaos, the film breaks the fourth wall and two ladies (played by the actresses who waved to the Beatles early in the film 'Help!') discuss a similar fit suffered by a son of one of the ladies (""He's not dead, they didn't get him. Missing. Turn up he will, missing he is..."").Colonel Grapple arrives moments later (using a jeep he had 'appropriated' from the unit earlier in the film) and gives them some water, and spurs them to carry on and take the oasis. In a lengthy 'death scene' (in which a man in plain clothes delivers a long-winded recount of a joke he gave to his men during the war), the men take the oasis seemingly without a real fight and while rounding up prisoners (the men whistling the theme to ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" all the while), a rifle lands butt-first on the ground, firing off a live round that strikes Spool in the head.While the men are setting up the cricket pitch (the ground is awfully uneven, forcing some of the men to use dynamite to blast open areas), the Melancholy Musketeer turns up having been hiding in an enemy truck at the oasis. Juniper berates him for cowardice, and in his 'rage,' he strikes the Musketeer, as well as Goodbody and Colonel Grapple. He is put on an immediate court martial (with the Musketeer as his appointed attorney) while the other men in the unit attempt to play cricket with the German captives looking on. Eventually, the General who gave them the assignment arrives with another high-ranking officer, who merely points out that the men are 'rotten bowlers.' Juniper hitches a ride with the officers as they leave (we last see him near the end of the film in a straightjacket with his stolen medals pinned on).During the intermissions of these scenes and the ones to come, Goodbody and Odlebog, the German officer, discuss their views on how the war should be fought and Odlebog is appalled to discover that Goodbody is a fascist at heart. The two men seem to have plenty in common (Odlebog seems to be somewhat negligent of his men, as well) in spite of their current circumstances.The flashbacks then take us to the Allied advance towards the Rhine river. Goodbody's men are among those tasked with making a foothold along the river. Goodbody accidentally shoots the Melancholy Musketeer in the foot, cutting his unit short by yet another man. While passing through a village, Gripweed steals a milk bottle while laughing hysterically, accidentally giving their position away to the nearby German forces. The remaining troops hole up in and around a German farmhouse but are forced to retreat as a tank approaches with infantry as support. Clapper is cornered by two enemy soldiers and stabbed with a bayonet (a bit of irony seeing as how Clapper had not taken a demonstration of bayonet use seriously earlier in the film). Gripweed discovers another British soldier holed up in a shelled out barn, looting a corpse. Gripweed derides the man and dismisses him as an amateur thief, but unfortunately is forced to run when German mortars start raining on the barn. As he crosses an open field, a mortar lands right in front of him, perforating him with shrapnel. He solemnly looks at the camera and says ""I knew this would happen. You knew it would happen, didn't you?""As Goodbody and Transom retreat, a German flamethrower operator nearly corners them. They kill the man and Transom flees as the enemy tank approaches. Goodbody yells for him to come back to their cover, and Transom is mowed down by a tank-mounted machine gun in the confusion (spouting regrets of not having killed the Lieutenant earlier in his last breaths).As we return to the present, Odlebog realizes that in spite of his orders to destroy the bridge, he feels it would be much better if he let Goodbody 'have' it as it would end the war and bring his retirement sooner. In what appears to be a slant against capitalism, the two negotiate a price and Goodbody writes him a check for it. Meanwhile, Grapple leads the push to the bridge in a tank and is the first to cross. He runs over Odlebog in the process, leaving Goodbody with a small piece of the cold, hard reality of war that he had missed all those times before (he then shows relief at not having to deal with a bad check as though he hadn't just lost a friend). He then addresses his 'men' (who are now merely just the replacmenets of the dead soldiers from before) with optimism over the inevitable end of World War II.The film ends with a post-war 'reunion' orchestrated by Goodbody, with the Melancholy Musketeer obviously being the only one who shows up. The Musketeer says there was a good reason for fighting, but Goodbody points out that HE had won the war.

"66","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062477/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The movie opens with the credits rolling over the visual of two uniformed U.S. Army officers driving a horse-drawn Army wagon up a remote and rocky road in what appears to be the Old West. The audio is Roger Miller (King of the Road) singing the beginning of The Ballad of Waterhole #3: The Code of the West (Lyrics by Robert Wells). Miller never appears in the movie except in voice-over. He will sing a verse or two of the ballad throughout the movie to narrate and punctuate the action.'I'll tell you a story that's never been toldOf rapin and killin and government gold.The place: Arizona; the year 84.Sit back and I'll tell you some more.'A thirty-year captain just earning his payWas moving a shipment of bullion that dayWhile men without honor were waiting to testThe unwritten Code of the West.'Its the Code of the West: you must honor your neighbors.The Code of the West, to your own self be true.The Code of the West, you must do unto others,Do unto others before they do it unto you.'The story is about the theft of 100 pounds of U.S. Army gold--an inside job pulled off by Sgt. Henry J. Foggers (Claude Akins), assigned to guard the gold, and his co-conspirators, Doc Quinlen (Roy Jenson), the mastermind of the caper, and Hilb (Timothy Carey), a billy-goat-bearded ruffian.The wagons destination is an Army warehouse. We see it arrive from a point of view inside a shoe parlor located next door to the warehouse. The shoemaker, Ben Akajanian (Harry Davis), is working on the sole of a cowboy boot, when we see that a gun barrel protruding from the rear curtain of the shop is trained on him. A voice says, 'Time to close up shop, shoemaker,' and Ben nervously moves to the door and shuts it, momentarily making eye contact with the Army officer, Captain Shipley (James Whitmore), who has got down from the wagon and is preparing to move the gold to the warehouse. Ben pulls down the shades of the shoe shop's windows.The inside thief, Sgt. Foggers, and his accomplices have built a tunnel from the shoe parlor to the Army warehouse, through which they will remove the gold. Quinlen waves the gun to summon Ben to the rear of the shop, where Hilb, chewing on a carrot says to Ben, 'In your hole, rabbit.' The three men move through the tunnel to the warehouse.Capt. Shipley, an earnest, if gullible, career officer, surveys his surroundings, then moves to the rear of the wagon and opens the covering. Two soldiers emerge carrying a strongbox, heavy for its size, marked 'Property of U.S. Army.' Shipley supervises their carrying the box from the rear of the wagon, to the door of the warehouse, upon which he knocks. Sgt. Foggers, referred to in the ballad as Henry J, is the lone soldier guarding the warehouse. He slides open the warehouse door only wide enough to accept the delivery. The captain apologizes to the sergeant for his inability to provide additional men to assist in guarding the gold, to which the sergeant responds, 'Sir, the Army's my home, and I would protect my home with my life.'As Capt. Shipley resumes his seat in the wagon, the gold is already moving through the tunnel to the shoemaker's shop. Cpl. Blyth, (Jim Boles) seated next to the captain, remarks, 'Thats uh, thats a lot of gold for one inside man to guard,' to which Shipley responds, 'Thats a lot of soldier, corporal.' 'Well, I still say its a lot of gold, sir,' to which Shipley retorts, 'Firm up! We're not civilians.' Through intercut scenes, we see that by the time the Army wagon begins to roll, the removal of the gold from federal custody is complete.'Sweet yellow, sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold,You make a man fever, you make a man bold.'In the shoemaker's shop, the thieves are squabbling. Hilb wants to bury Shoemaker Ben in the shaft, but Quinlen says that the shoemaker is temporarily useful as an alibi--his disappearance will make him appear to be the thief, and if things do not go well, Sgt. Henry J. can claim to be meek Ben's hostage rather than a deserter. Ben complains, 'You cannot dispose of my life like it was a chess piece,' to which Quinlen replies, 'No? You do everything right, you have some hope. Do anything wrong, and I'll guarantee you pain.' As Quinlen digs his fingers into the pressure points near Ben's neck, causing Ben to sink to his knees, Quinlen continues, 'You understand pain?'Hilb wants to divvy but Doc Quinlen says he will bury the gold. Henry J. must step between Quinlen and Hilb to prevent a fight. The sergeants face says he is no happier with this plan than Hilb, but his words say, 'That's alright with me.' Quinlen will make a map showing where the gold is, and the three men will meet in the town of Delores in a couple of weeks to divide the loot. Hilb says, 'I may get there just a little earlier,' and Quinlen says, 'If you do, don't let me see you.' Hilb brays like a billy-goat to express his displeasure.Fast forward a couple of weeks: Two cowboys on horseback ride into town past a sign that reads, Delores.'So the town of Delores, that morning in MayWas in for an infamous day.'In a saloon in Delores we first meet Lewton Cole (James Coburn) dealing Three Card Monte to the bartender (Jay Ose) for the price of a cold glass of fresh milk. Cole is setting up the two cowpokes who have just arrived from the range. Enter Quinlen, who owes a gambling debt to Cole. Cole has pinched Quinlen's wallet claiming he is entitled to interest on the debt. When Quinlen shows concern only about one twenty dollar bill, which has written upon it in large letters, 'Mex' above a line, and in smaller letters, 'X Integrity' below the line, followed by an arrow along side three dots, followed by 'W #3', Cole deduces that this particular twenty-dollar note has significance beyond its monetary value. Angry that Cole now knows something, Quinlen challenges Cole to a shootout at sundown, and storms out of the bar.The bartender solemnly hands Cole his glass of milk, and observes that Cole has opened his mouth to the wrong man. Quinlen is a quick draw who will 'cut your pocket out as soon as you start to reach.' Cole replies, 'It does look like I stepped in it a bit,' sniffs the milk, and sits back down at the card table.One of the cowpokes (Buzz Henry) has used the distraction of the exchange between Quinlen and Cole to bend the edge of the Queen of Spades so that when the game of Three Card Monte resumes, he will know which card is the queen. The cowboy wins successive hands, so Cole quits. The cowboy, sensing that he cannot lose, begs Cole to continue, so Cole raises the stakes. He asks the cowpoke how much money he has, and agrees to play one more hand for the man's entire stake, as well as the stake of his buddy. Cole asks, Now you sure you want to do this? and the grinning cowboys eagerly nod, Yes. Their smiles evaporates when Cole's deal reveal that all three cards now have identically bent corners.Sundown has arrived, and as Cole moves to rake in all of the cowpokes money, Quinlen is heard calling out Cole from the street. Knowing that his life can be measured in minutes, because he will surely be shot dead in the street, Cole remarks, Lucky in cards, unlucky in love, then asks, Did I wash you out, boys? and graciously tosses them a few coins.Cole moves to the bar, and drops a few coins for the bartender, who, grave at the prospect of what is about to unfold, slides the coins back to Cole. Cole slides them once more to the bartender, gestures toward the cowpokes, and says, Buy the boys a drink.Cole leaves the saloon, preparing to meet his maker. The soundtrack is a rumble of dirge-like drums. Quinlen taunts Cole from far down the street You're yellow, Cole. Lets get on with it. The doomed man forthrightly moves to his horse, ostensibly for a handgun with which to participate in the duel. Instead, he pulls a rifle and, from 100 yards, guns down Quinlen.Against an early evening sky, Cole moves to Quinlen's lifeless body; out of respect, Cole doffs his Stetson, shakes his head as if to say, What a shame, and then removes the cash from the dead mans inside breast pocket.You don't draw with a stranger if he's faster than you.You've sung your last ditty,You've kissed your last prettyAnd played your last hand if you do.As Cole rides off, Hilb emerges to stand over Quinlen's body. He rakes his spurs over the sprawled mans chest and kicks his thigh to confirm he is dead, doffs his hat, and emits his trademark billy-goat bray. Hilb replaces his hat and watches Cole ride into the darkening evening. Cole, bathed in the red glow of dusk silhouetted against a purple sky, examines the map and gazes toward the horizon.When fate is the dealer you raise or you call;A chance-takin man plays the cards as they fall.A map worth a killin is worth tracking down,So off to Integrity Town.The next day, a column of Army cavalry led by Capt. Shipley, cantors past a sign above a water trough, Integrity 8 miles. When the cavalry has passed, Lewton Cole surfaces from being submerged in the water trough, sputters to regain the breath he has been holding, and resumes shaving and puffing a cigar.In the town of Integrity, Sheriff John (Carroll O'Connor) and his deputy (Bruce Dern), are discussing the sheriffs reelection bid, and the accounts of the heist in the newspaper. Everyone seems to think that Shoemaker Ben has taken the gold and hightailed it to Mexico. The sheriff has some ideas about how to recover the gold and wishes he had a nice theft to investigate. The deputy observes that Sheriff John has a habit of bringing thieves back dead and bringing back only half of the loot. The sheriff says, Half is better than none, aint it? He shares with his deputy that he had once planned to pull off a gold robbery, but had to give it up because he got elected sheriff. But Im gonna tell ya, if this job weren't so sweet and soft, I might just elect to follow the criminal profession. His deputy observes, You'd be real good [at it] too, John.Cole arrives in Integrity on the back of a wagon, carrying his saddle. His horse has gone lame. He moves to the sheriff and deputy to inquire about buying a new mount. The deputy tell Cole that the sheriff owns the best horse in the county, Old Blue, but the sheriff says the horse is not for sale.Cole, whose face is on a Wanted for Murder poster on the wall, tricks the two lawmen, and locks them in the sheriffs own jail, where he forces them to strip naked. In response to Sheriff Johns question, Why you doin this terrible thing to me? Cole dryly remarks, A naked sheriff makes a slow posse. As he leaves, he says, Being found locked naked, in your own jail, in an election year. Now, to be too noisy about it might be bad politics. Shhh. The deputy looks down at himself and then at the sheriff and says, He sure left us bare, followed by his signature phrase, Ain't that right, John?Cut to the sheriff's ranch outside of town, where the sheriffs fetching daughter, Billee (Margaret Blye), needs three more eggs for the batter of the chocolate cake she is making. She calls for the Mexican stable-hand, Francisco (Alex Tinne), but he is taking a siesta.A yellow-haired woman is early to bloom;Her laughter is roses, her smile is perfume.But the child of a lawman can die on the vineWith no man to taste of her wine.So, Billee enters the barn, where the hens nest and Old Blue is stabled, to find Cole changing his drawers. She smiles at Cole, and he returns the smile. Billee is then all business: Alright, what are you doin here? Cole says, Puttin on my pants. She asks, Well, what do you want? and he says, Well, I was gonna get on this big black horse and ride him outta here, butBillee moves toward the door, but Cole cuts her off. She says, Look. Im not alone. Cole points to where the stableman is sleeping in the shade, What? Francisco? What is he gonna do, challenge me to a duel? He dont have a gun. Billee says, Well my daddy does, and he's the sheriff of this county. Cole says, Yeah, I know; I seen him, and then eyeing Billees fine form, says, You must take after your momma. She buttons up her dress, and Cole reciprocates by unbuttoning his shirt. She informs him, You're gonna have to take it, and a wrestling match ensues. When he has her where he wants her, he says, Easy now; you're supposed to wear yourself out lovin not fightin. She gasps, You can't do it this way, and he says, Slow. Slow. Easy. He kisses her, and she returns the kiss.Some minutes later, a rooster crows, and Cole exits the barn leading Old Blue, and mounts him.Its the Code of the West: you don't leave for tomorrow,The Code of the West, what can be done today.As Cole departs, Billee, disheveled, wistfully emerges from the barn.Its the Code of the West, its a true fact of livinWhat's lovingly given will lovingly come back your way.Sheriff John arrives home, and orders his Mexican servant, Francisco to get Old Blue saddled. The sheriff, obviously preoccupied with the preparations to pursue Cole, notices his daughters disheveled condition and asks if she is all right. She is not sure. She says, I think he raped me. Incredulous, the sheriff asks, Who? Francisco? Billee says, dreamily, He was big. And tall, then remembering herself, adds, and mean, and cruel. Francisco interrupts, Padron. Blue. He is gone. What do you mean gone? and Billee says, I tried to tell you. Sheriff John, starting to get the picture, asks Billee, Wait a minute; was your man wearing a gamblers coat and a little brown vest, to which Billee replies, Part of the time. As the painful reality sinks in, the sheriff growls, Cole. The man must hate me personal.Sheriff John prepares to mount an ornery mule to pursue. He took my Big Blue out in that desert. Billee protests, Oh Daddy! Is that all you care about? The sheriff, eager to get after Cole, says to his daughter, Aw Billee, now Ill make it up to you. You know a man picks his pleasure from the nearest tree. Why if you weren't my own daughter--I mean there's worse things. He could've killed you. Now that a been worse, wouldn't it, I think. She angrily says, You bring him back. Yeah, I'll bring him back. My election to a third term as sheriff depends on it. And my honor. YOUR honor? Oh, darlin, I can only keep my mind on one offense at a time.The scene shifts to Cole on Old Blue:The desert was losin its fight with the sun,As Cole stopped for water at hole #1.Just what was he chasin he'd sure like to know,But he still had him two holes to go.Oh the Code of the West: show your backside to evil.The Code of the West, give the devil his due.The Code of the West, you gotta do unto othersDo unto others before they do it unto you.The sheriff is checking the trail, but is having difficulty with the mule.Now rapin and killin ain't really so bad.But stealing Ol Blue, now that made Sheriff John mad.You don't help yourself to the eggs in the nestOf a man with a badge on his vest.Sheriff John arrives at Hole #1. He says to the mule, Two waterholes to go. Were gonna get him at one of them. He dips his hat in the brackish water, and asks the mule, Do you want any. He takes a sip and says, Well, it ain't too bad. It ain't gonna get any better at the next one either.Nightfall. We see Old Blue meandering through the desert with Cole asleep in the saddle. The horse finds its own way to Waterhole #2.Poor tumbleweed stumblin from boulder to stoneYour permanent address is places unknown.You eat when you're hungry, you drink when you're dryIf wishes were eagles, you'd fly.Cole makes camp beside Waterhole #2, puffs on his cigar, and doodles a stick in the dying embers of his fire. He covers the shallow pit with desert dirt, spreads his blanket over the now dead but still warm fire bed and curls up to sleep. Sheriff John, a few miles behind, is also done for the day.Rest your head on your saddle; dream of fortune and fame.Meanwhile, Billee sighs in her bed, and then moves toward the window.When the winds in the willowA girl hugs her pillowAnd wishes that she knew his name.Sunrise. Cole is back in the saddle, breathing in the desert air, and heading for Waterhole #3. A few hours later, the sheriff arrives at Cole's camp, and carefully examines a cigar butt that he has removed from the sand.Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Billee saddles her sorrel, and heads into the desert at the gallop. Cole surveys the landscape and rides on. The sheriff, hot on Coles heels, is still having trouble with the mule, who throws him into a sand dune. Spitting sand, John says, Damn mule, followed by his signature line, I wish you hadn't done that.Cole has arrived at his destination, and is wading waist-deep, peering at the bottom of Waterhole #3. Cole finds the strongbox, lugs it to dry land, when he becomes aware of another presence; he turns and is staring down the barrel of Sheriff Johns rifle. Good morning, Sheriff.Go ahead, go for that gun. I wish you'd go for that gun.Well, I don't need to now, sheriff. I got all of yours.Cole bends to open the box. The sheriff kneels with him, and reads the words on the box, Property of the U.S. Army, and asks, What's in it, General Grant's head? Cole guesses its bullion--the proceeds of the robbery in the news. If it is, its over a hundred pounds of that fine yellow gold.Cole fiddles with the lock. The sheriff says, You just get up outta there. Ill get it open. What the hell, Sheriff. I found it; I get to open it. Again, Cole gets the jump on John with his derringer, which he points at John's chest. Abruptly, Cole trains the pistol on the lock, fires, and holsters his gun. The two men gleefully discover the contents of the Army's strongbox.John regains the advantage. He permits Cole to change into dry britches, and asks him what the gold might fetch in Mexico. I imagine those thieves, if they got across the river without sinking too deep in the sand, and got by those Mexican bandits, and they knew how to make a deal down there, I imagine those thieves might get in upwards to a hundred thousand dollars.The sheriff relieves Cole of his stingy little gun, and has Cole arrange the gun's chain properly in the sheriff's vest pocket. Cole says, A little touch of gold always looks good on a man. The sheriff replies, Now I got something that will look good on you, and applies handcuffs. Cole says, I might just sue you for false arrest. I didn't break any law, Sheriff.No? What about stealin my horse?I needed that horse to recover the gold.Lockin me in my own jail?I wanted you behind me.Murder?Self defense.Rapin?Assault with a friendly weapon?Cut to Billee, struggling to follow the trail, but determined.Now treat a girl tender, shell preen like a bride,But take her for granted, she'll come for your hide.She'll shoot off your head if you leave her behind,And you'll lose your natural mind.The sheriff is bringing Cole back to Integrity. As the two men travel, the sheriff points out, Even if they don't stretch your neck, you'll be wearing a number into the twentieth century. Cole says, I got a number for you, Sheriff: one hundred and eight pounds of yellow gold in that saddlebag. You show me an honest sheriff and I'll show you a man without money.Cut to Sgt. Henry J. and Hilb, with Shoemaker Ben in tow, also on the trail of the man who stole the map. Back to Cole and the sheriff: Cole continues to use his magic tongue to turn the sheriff into an accomplice:You know, a man with money, he don't touch the principal.He don't?No. He lives off the interest. And there'll be lots of interest. He'll subscribe to a little railroad stock, or some cotton futures, maybe some corn, tobacco, sugar, wheat--all from his ranch, where he's got a fancy saloon and his own private gambling hall for a watering hole. And all them sloe-eyed senoritas just a hungerin...After my money.True, John, but you will wear out before you go broke.John and Cole stop for a meager lunch of beef jerky. While admiring the beauty of the desert, they share stories of their lives, their career choices and their loves; they bond.Sheriff: How come at your age a fella like you ain't tied down yet?Cole: Well I was. Once.What'd you do to her?Well, I don't know, just got on separate trains, I guess.That thing with Billee, course not being there I'll never really know, but what was that all about?Just a hasty love affair. Nothing got bruised but her pride.Well, you should have stayed to talk a bit. I always talk about five minutes before I run. You left her upside down.Don't think on it, John. Think about something important like getting our gold to Mexico.John does not object to the concept of our gold. They are now partners, although when Cole lights John's cigar, we note that he is still wearing the handcuffs. Cole sings, Going back, going back, to Durango, and John joins him, where the sun goes down at noon.John and Cole continue on their way, talking. You always been wearin that badge? No, we ran cows after that big dry-up in 73. Cole responds, Yeah, we had some cattle until the government started taxin public land. The sheriff: Well, if it ain't the drought, if it ain't the hoof-n-mouth, the black leg, or the government throwin its hook into everything, it's always some damn thing, always. You're right there, John, and Cole gestures toward trouble: Sgt. Henry J., Hilb and the shoemaker have caught them.Hilb orders the shoemaker to search the men and remove their guns. As the shoemaker reaches for the watch chain attached to the derringer, the sheriff says, It's only a watch. Hilb says, I want it, whereupon the shoemaker turns the guns he has removed from the sheriff on Hilb, who spits and says, Drop them guns or I'll kill ya, and Ben, shaking like a leaf, drops them.Hilb is ready to shoot Cole, the sheriff, and Ben, but Henry convinces Hilb that murder at this juncture would not be advisable. Hilb points his gun at Ben, He knows everything, that shoemaker. Henry replies, What do we care; we'll be swappin tequilas with Ortiz at the presidential palace. Hilb points his gun at Cole, He killed Quinlen. Henry says, Well, you should thank him; you get a bigger cut. Now, ya see how everything works out? Turning to Cole, Henry asks, Not that it matters but, how did you know about Quinlen? Cole replies, You got time for a long story, sergeant? Henry smiles and says, Nah. Cuff em, shoemaker, on their ankles.Hilb says, We divvy, and Henry says, Why not. He throws a cord to the shoemaker to tie the men back-to-back. Henry moves the gold to his saddlebag, but first hugs it.Sweet yellow, sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold,You make a man fever, you make a man bold.Youre won like a woman, a treasure to hold,Sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold.Henry stares at the bullion, Kind of makes your tongue coat up, and Hilb brays like a billy-goat. In the distance, the cavalry column gallops by. Henry says, My old outfit. To Cole and the sheriff, tied together, Bye now. The thieves mount, and as they depart with the gold and the horses, Henry says to Cole and John, As we used to say in the cavalry, Without a horse, a man's afoot.You make a man fever, you make a man boldSweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold.Cut to Billee on her horse, checking the ground for signs of the track.Cut back to Cole and John struggling to free themselves, while Cole tells the long story that the sergeant did not have time for. And there was this twenty dollar bill with a bunch a doodlin on it. I didn't know what it was until Ol Quinlen made it important by not lettin me go without a shootout. Asked why he didn't stick around to clear his name, Cole says, I don't know, John. I guess I was just in a hurry to see what this man was so willin to die over. The sheriff says, The way things are gonna work out, you're gonna be a hero, and I'm gonna be the town jackass.Unknown to the two struggling men, Billee has arrived on the scene, but remains in the background while the sheriff complains about where Cole's finger is. Billee says, Well now, look at that. Thats something you don't see everyday: two big men, way out here in the middle of the desert, playin grapple-finger. When ordered by her father to cut out the smart talk and get over here and cut us loose, Billee says, Maybe, approaches, and delivers roundhouse blows to the belly of each man.She mounts her horse to go find me some Indians or some red fire ants. The sheriff, with Coles advice, tries to mollify her. I promise you this man, but I gotta have him first. Now you see that, don't you? Its a point of honor, and my duty. Billee, listen to me, I know I'm a fool and a sinner, but it's only your poor dad you'd be turnin loose if you did it. Billee. She reluctantly gets off her horse to help.The only knife is in the front pocket of Cole's britches. She reaches her fingers in and Cole encourages her. Deeper. She frees her father, but refuses to untie, Cole. Instead, she cocks a gun at him. Cole says tenderly, Go ahead [and shoot me]. It was worth it. She looks him in the eyes, and asks, What's your name anyway? and John says, Aw, Billee, quit foolin around. Here, gimme that gun. John takes the gun, saying, His name is Lewton Cole. I thought you knew him.All three climb aboard Billee's horse. As they start off, Cole asks, Where are we goin, John? and the sheriff says, Integrity guards the pass to Mexico, don't it? Well, our best chance is if they lay over in Integrity. Billee, seated between the two men, squirming, says, What about my rape! to which John says, Forget about it. Were after gold!The three alternate positions: one walking and two riding, then the men walking, until nightfall finds Billee and Cole on the horse, with John walking alongside, leading the horse. Cole hugs Billee. Billee says, I should have shot you back there, and Cole laughs and says, You never woulda shot me, and she says, right in that deep pocket. The sheriff smiles. Cole asks, What did you want me to do anyway, bring you candies and flowers? and she says, No. I wanted you to do the decent thing, and Cole asks, Which is what? and she says, Well, if you don't know, what's the use of talking. Cole: What does that mean? Billee: Think about it. Cole laughs and says, Oh, no, Billee, we don't want to start thinking about it. That takes us too far from the point of it all. She looks back and asks, What's that mean? and Cole says, Think about it.Well she thought, and he thought, and like it or not,The colder she acted, the warmer he got.The horse takes a misstep and the three are thrown, with Cole and Billee tumbling down an embankment, and Cole ending face-to-face on top of her. She says, Has anybody ever said anything about your style? John yells, Thats your fault, Cole. If you hadn't a been doin what you oughtn't a back there, this never woulda happened. Come on Billee, get out from under him, and lets get goin.The thieves have arrived at the outskirts of Integrity. Sgt. Henry J. tells Hilb to stay to guard our flank, while he and the shoemaker head for the hotel, and then to a brothel operated by Lavinia (Joan Blondell). Ben plays the organ, while Lavinia greets Henry. He opens his saddle bag to give her a peek, and she says, Looks like you robbed the Army. He asks, Do I have the house for the night? and she says, Your credit seems good. The place is empty of other customers because the town council is meeting and the sheriff is out chasing a man who locked him in his own jail, and in a very unusual condition.Henry moves to the eight prostitutes and says, All right girls, and in military fashion, Present arms! whereupon the women descend on Henry, squealing with delight. Henry kisses as many as he can.Hilb, at his post outside of town, spots the approaching three on horseback, and hightails it to the hotel, where he barricades himself in an upstairs room. The sheriff, Cole and Billee, riding at the gallop, are again thrown, this time in front of a desert shack. The man inside, pokes his head out the window and says, Get the hell off my lawn.They run into town, and the sheriff exclaims, Cole, there's Old Blue, tied up in front of the hotel. Cole is carrying Billee over his shoulder, his hand firmly on her butt, as she yells, Put me down! Put me down! The sheriff says, Put her down before she wakes up the whole town. Cole: You're gonna have to tell me why you named her Billee. John: Her ma and me was tryin to make a boy. Cole: Well, you didn't even come close.They enter the hotel, check the register, and ask George, the hotel clerk (Robert Cornthwaite) about the men registered as Smith and Wesson in 301. The sheriff asks the clerk for his guns. The clerk hands a pistol to the sheriff, saying, I've got one of two Colts were taken off of John Wesley Hardin by Constable John Selman after he shot Hardin behind the right ear in the Acme Saloon in El Paso on a Monday afternoon.The clerk produces a second handgun: This 32 caliber rimfire Hopkins & Allen was almost smuggled in to Bill Longley before they hanged him high, October 11, 1878, in Giddings, Lee County, Texas. Cole: Does it shoot? The clerk: Beautifully. Cole: Thank you very much, George. Ill try and return it in the same condition.The sheriff and Cole move upstairs.When a showdowns a comin, when a shootout is due,In the lobby, George says to Billee, Oh, I forgot to tell them. The big and the little one checked in, stayed long enough to get some stuff, and then went right out.Billee: Where'd they go?George: Well, you know...Billee: Lavinia's! As Billee runs upstairs, George says, Did I mention the scary one?Face up to the danger, throw a slug in a strangerBefore he throws one into you.Billee delivers the current situation to Cole and her father. Cole asks her to go downstairs to ask George for the key to 302, opposite the room in which Hilb is holed up. Billee tells Cole to go down himself, whereupon her father kicks her in the butt and tell her to go on down like you're told and get that there key. As Billee moves away rubbing the place where she has been kicked, Cole observes, She sure moves fine, and the sheriff says, Aw Cole, dammit.At Lavinia's, Henry is having a good old time, while Lavinia herself takes an interest in Ben. He tells her the story of his abduction, and says, I am getting ideas. Lavinia cautions him: Don't get reckless, Robert. He corrects her, Ben.Meanwhile, the sheriff and Hilb eye each other's hotel room doors through their respective keyholes. Cole has taken a position at the window to monitor Hilbs only route of escape. Billee tries to tell her father her side of what occurred in the barn, but John dismisses her with, Not now, Billee. She says, Daddy, don't you care? Doesn't it mean anything? which he ignores, and asks Cole, You reckon he's still in there? Billee moves to Cole and demands to know, What have you done to us? to which Cole replies, Believed your eyes and not your words, Billee. She says, All right. If nobody cares, I don't, and flops on her back on the bed. Cole reacts to her implied offer, and John scowls, Not now, Cole.At Lavinia's, Henry, laughing and wearing a pink garter as a headband, heads upstairs with two of the women, while the others wave. Lavinia takes Ben upstairs.In the hotel room, John is impatient. He asks Cole to tell him again about living off the interest, but Cole says, You gotta grow your own dream. Suddenly worried, John asks Cole if he is thinking of giving him some kind of second-card deal. Cole says, I'm not dealin this hand.You gotta do unto others, do unto others, before they do it unto you.The standoff continues until dawn. A drunk cowpoke, (Buzz Henry, who is also the film's stuntman) rides his horse beneath Hilb's hotel window. Hilb drops a note on his head, written on a pillowcase, HELP HELP. I'm a prisoner in room 301. FiFi LaFlame.The cowboy rides his horse into the hotel lobby, runs upstairs, and is taken by Hilb at gunpoint as a hostage to shield Hilb's escape. In the lobby, Hilb mounts the horse and, amid gunfire from Cole and the sheriff, gallops toward Lavinia's. In his haste, he drops his share of the gold in the middle of the street. As gunfire is raining down, he cannot retrieve the fallen treasure.The sound of the shootout awakens the denizens of the brothel. Whatever Ben and Lavinia have been doing together invigorates Ben and makes him reckless. The sergeant comes downstairs, but is almost struck by bullets from a crazed Hilb, who is returning fire at anything that moves.Crying, My gold! My gold! Hilb wheels his horse, and continues shooting until, out of ammo, he rides out of the movie, crying and braying like a billy-goat.The sheriff moves to retrieve the saddlebag containing half of the gold. Henry takes a shot at him, but retreats. Cole gallops toward John on Old Blue, and dismounts. John places the saddlebag on the horse, and says, Well that's it. I got mine. Cole says, Thats good John. Now you can help me get mine. The sheriff is preparing to leave, and Cole says, Hell, this hand isn't over yet, is it? The sheriff says, All right, Cole, and the two plan how they will attack Henry.Henry is creating a defensive position in Lavinia's, destroying the brothel in the process. Lavinia desperately saves a painting of a younger version of herself, and tells Henry he will have to pay for the damages. He replies, as he frantically moves furniture to create a barricade, I always pick up my broken glass, and tells Lavinia that she has to talk the sheriff out of this fight.The condition of the premises does not improve as Cole and the sheriff take the gunfight inside. Using shotguns, they are taking out doors, walls, mirrors and chandeliers wholesale. When Lavinia screams, You are about to shoot-up my meal ticket, the sheriff says, while reloading, This is official business. I'll get the town council to pay for any refurbishments.As the fusillade intensifies, and a piece of pottery explodes, Lavinia cries, That vase was brought around the horn! This is a home, not just a house, you bastards!During a momentary lull, as the men reload, Cole calls for a hiatus, so We can talk a spell. Henry asks, What's your proposition? The sheriff responds, Your life for that gold. That's the proposition. Well? Henry says, I'm thinkin about it. Do you know how hard I had to work for that gold? The sheriff says, Ain't that terrible, Cole? Why, in another minute he'll have us believin he earned it.Henry then sees out the window Shoemaker Ben being lowered in a sling made of bed sheets. The hookers are helping him escape with the remaining gold. Henry runs outside, and the other two follow. The shooting continues, as Henry is both pursuing Ben and protecting his own hide. John has a strategy, and Cole reluctantly agrees to attempt to execute the more dangerous maneuver.While Ben was playin steal the gold, and make your getaway,The other three played shoot-em-up and turnabout's fair play.But Ben had tasted painted lips and heard the sirens song,So he could hardly keep from goin wrong.From the upstairs windows, the hookers are signaling to Ben with their undergarments to assist his escape.Its the Code of the West: heed the word of your sisters;The Code of the West, make a left turn from sin.The Code of the West, keep an eye on temptation; recite the quotationThat says, When-Satan-calls-your-name-it doesn't-matter-how-you-play-the game-cause-all-he-cares-about-isDid you win?Henry pursues Ben to an outhouse; Ben slugs Henry in the face with the saddlebag filled with gold, and is able to escape. Cole and John are destroying the shack with their shotguns, so that Henry is forced to use a woman's corset to waive the white flag of surrender.Cole demands, Sergeant, where's the gold? and Henry points to the shoemaker mounting Old Blue. All the gold is now reunited on the horse with Ben.Now Cole and John and Henry J. were feelin mighty sad,As Shoemaker Ben escapes on John's horse with the gold, the sheriff says, Oh Blue! Hell let anybody ride him.To bank a little sack of gold, could turn a good man bad,But when you pick the meek and mild against the brave and boldThe meek inherit all the Army's gold.The three men have forgotten their fight, and join forces to pursue Ben. Billee, on foot, yells, Hey wait for me! and runs to the livery.Now, in the meantime Billee-girl was schemin on her own.She knew a healthy sweet young thing can't live by bread alone.Billee emerges from the livery stable on her own mount at the gallop.To play the tricky game of life a woman needs a plan.To play the game of love she needs a man.Ben has ridden Old Blue into the encampment of the cavalry. His three pursuers also gallop into the hands of the Army. Cpl. Blye summons Capt. Shipley from his tent, who dons his cap: Well, what have we here? Corporal Blye, put Sgt. Foggers, Henry J., U.S. Cav., under arrest immediately, and to Henry, You were supposed to be guarding the Army's gold.Henry salutes, Sgt. Foggers, Henry J., reporting sir! He took me as a hostage until I got the best of him; pointing at Ben, The foreign shoemaker, sir.Ben stutters trying to defend himself. Capt. Shipley, Well it fits. It was his tunnel. Sgt. Foggers, if this is true, the Army has lost a deserter and gained a hero.Shipley continues, Cpl. Blye, arrest Lewton Cole for the murder of Doc Quinlen.Cole: Oh captain, captain, sir. Self defense. See, Doc Quinlen found out that I found out that shoemaker and him was plannin that whole gold robbery. I was forced to do it to save the Army's gold.Capt. Shipley: Well, Mr. Cole, if what you say is true, you're in for a nice reward. Turning to the sheriff, Honest John, did all of this transpire as my sergeant and Mr. Cole have related?John: Ah yes, captain. You might say these men were acting as my deputies in the recovery of the gold.Shipley moves toward the sheriff, No reward for us professionals, eh, John? Of course, you'll get your recognition come election time. Corporal Blye! Arrest the foreigner.Ben: I am innocent. I am the only innocent.Capt. Shipley, laughing, They all say that, don't they John?Ben: I was the hostage.Sheriff, sharing the captains laugh: Ain't that terrible, captain?Ben: It is hopeless.Capt. Shipley: Hopeless, eh? You are asking me to doubt appearances. He points at Henry, The Army; at John, The Law, and at Cole, Professional enterprise. Corporal Blye! Haul him away. Careful, he's a dangerous man.Ben refuses to be handled: No man hauls Ben Akajanian. I walk free; alone. Thank you.As Ben is led away, the captain smiles at Henry, Sgt. Foggers, and walks toward him, Henry J., where is the Army's gold?Its in the saddlebag, sir, but there is nothing there except rocks. Get that shoemaker back here!Billee arrives at the camp. Capt. Shipley greets her, What a pleasure to see you here, Miss Billee.She points at Cole: Arrest that man, but the captain says, It turns out that it was a case of self defense.Billee says, I don't care about that. He forced his affections on me.Captain Shipley and Cole exchange smiles, Miss Billee, there is not a court in the land who would convict with a ravishing beauty like you for a witness. And who on the jury would not do the same thing if given the chance.Bens response to interrogation is stony silence. Everyone leaves to find where Ben has stashed the gold, leaving only Billee and Ben in the Army camp. Billee asks Ben, Do you trust me? Cole backtracks in time to see Billee gallop off, leaving Ben alone.Now Lewton Cole knew Billee had some mighty fetchin waysOle Ben would tell her everything, and still get ninety days.Billee cantors to a spot in the desert near some boulders.Beneath the rock, beside the trail, that leads to Mexico,You'll find yourself a hundred pounds, or so.Its the Code of the West: every girl needs a dowry.Billee finds the gold and smiles, Now I've got you, Lewton Cole.The Code of the West, and it don't matter who.Billee loads two of the four bars of bullion into the saddlebag on Old Blue.The Code of the West, when a girl's pushin twenty, shes got to give plentyBillee picks up the other two bars, kisses one of them, and loads them on the horse.To end up with rice in her shoe.A hand holding a small bouquet of native goldenrod enters the foreground of the frame. Cole's voice: Hello there, Billee honey.Billee: You! What are you doin here?Cole: I just come lookin after you.Billee: You're after the gold.Cole: Oh well, that too, but uh, What about partners?Billee: What kind of partners?Cole: What kind of partners did you have in mind?Billee: Full time.Cole takes a moment to think over this proposition, then asks, You take me like I am?Billee melts, walks over to Cole, takes the flowers, smells them, smiles, removes Cole's hat, and kisses him. The two sink out of the frame, leaving the camera unfocused on the desert hills.The cavalry, seen from overhead, cantors on its way to the sound of a bugle. Cut to Ben sitting forlornly on a rock; Lavinia's carriage arrives, driven by her houseman, The Prince (Rupert Crosse). Ben, relieved, says Lavinia. I thought you would never get here. Lavinia smiles, and Ben gets in the carriage. They ride to where Ben hid the gold. The cavalry is also riding to the spot where the gold has been hidden.Cut to Lewton Cole donning his jacket, and placing goldenrod in the band of his hat.Well, Cole had a few other things left to do,He flowered his Stetson, and boarded Ol Blue.Billee (naked): Hey! Wait a minute! Where ya goin?Cole (on his horse): Durango. Thats the way I am. Bye bye.The rougher you treat em, the stronger they grieve.Billee, now dressed, reclines on a rock watching Cole in the distance riding off.And the longer they watch when you leave.The sheriff and the sergeant arrive at Billees location and circle her on their horses, but ignore her, asking each other where they are headed. Lavinia's carriage arrives. The sergeant yells to Ben, Hey shoemaker, are you gonna tell us where the gold is? Lavinia pulls a gun, points it at John and Henry, and says, Go and get it, Ben.As Ben gets out of the carriage, the Army arrives. Shipley demands, Where is the Army's gold?Ben: 'Where is it, Miss Billee?'Billee uses the goldenrod bouquet whose aroma she has been admiring to point toward Lewton Cole, who can be seen riding Old Blue on the rim of a distant ridge.Old Mexico is just ahead, so gambler move along.There ain't nobody there to care if you did right or wrong.You shot a thief, you found some gold, you stole a kiss or two,And the world's a better place because of you.Oh the Code of the West: When you're drinkin tequila,The Code of the West, toast the Red, White and Blue;The Code of the West, be good to your neighbors--Your new northern neighbors--Remember they were awful good to you.THE ENDThe Paramount Picture LogoThat's the Code of the West!Roll the Cast of Characters.","

            The synopsis below may give away important plot points.
    
    Synopsis
    The movie opens with the credits rolling over the visual of two uniformed U.S. Army officers driving a horse-drawn Army wagon up a remote and rocky road in what appears to be the Old West. The audio is Roger Miller (King of the Road) singing the beginning of The Ballad of Waterhole #3: The Code of the West (Lyrics by Robert Wells). Miller never appears in the movie except in voice-over. He will sing a verse or two of the ballad throughout the movie to narrate and punctuate the action.'I'll tell you a story that's never been told
Of rapin and killin and government gold.
The place: Arizona; the year 84.
Sit back and I'll tell you some more.'A thirty-year captain just earning his pay
Was moving a shipment of bullion that day
While men without honor were waiting to test
The unwritten Code of the West.'Its the Code of the West: you must honor your neighbors.
The Code of the West, to your own self be true.
The Code of the West, you must do unto others,
Do unto others before they do it unto you.'The story is about the theft of 100 pounds of U.S. Army gold--an inside job pulled off by Sgt. Henry J. Foggers (Claude Akins), assigned to guard the gold, and his co-conspirators, Doc Quinlen (Roy Jenson), the mastermind of the caper, and Hilb (Timothy Carey), a billy-goat-bearded ruffian.The wagons destination is an Army warehouse. We see it arrive from a point of view inside a shoe parlor located next door to the warehouse. The shoemaker, Ben Akajanian (Harry Davis), is working on the sole of a cowboy boot, when we see that a gun barrel protruding from the rear curtain of the shop is trained on him. A voice says, 'Time to close up shop, shoemaker,' and Ben nervously moves to the door and shuts it, momentarily making eye contact with the Army officer, Captain Shipley (James Whitmore), who has got down from the wagon and is preparing to move the gold to the warehouse. Ben pulls down the shades of the shoe shop's windows.The inside thief, Sgt. Foggers, and his accomplices have built a tunnel from the shoe parlor to the Army warehouse, through which they will remove the gold. Quinlen waves the gun to summon Ben to the rear of the shop, where Hilb, chewing on a carrot says to Ben, 'In your hole, rabbit.' The three men move through the tunnel to the warehouse.Capt. Shipley, an earnest, if gullible, career officer, surveys his surroundings, then moves to the rear of the wagon and opens the covering. Two soldiers emerge carrying a strongbox, heavy for its size, marked 'Property of U.S. Army.' Shipley supervises their carrying the box from the rear of the wagon, to the door of the warehouse, upon which he knocks. Sgt. Foggers, referred to in the ballad as Henry J, is the lone soldier guarding the warehouse. He slides open the warehouse door only wide enough to accept the delivery. The captain apologizes to the sergeant for his inability to provide additional men to assist in guarding the gold, to which the sergeant responds, 'Sir, the Army's my home, and I would protect my home with my life.'As Capt. Shipley resumes his seat in the wagon, the gold is already moving through the tunnel to the shoemaker's shop. Cpl. Blyth, (Jim Boles) seated next to the captain, remarks, 'Thats uh, thats a lot of gold for one inside man to guard,' to which Shipley responds, 'Thats a lot of soldier, corporal.' 'Well, I still say its a lot of gold, sir,' to which Shipley retorts, 'Firm up! We're not civilians.' Through intercut scenes, we see that by the time the Army wagon begins to roll, the removal of the gold from federal custody is complete.'Sweet yellow, sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold,
You make a man fever, you make a man bold.'In the shoemaker's shop, the thieves are squabbling. Hilb wants to bury Shoemaker Ben in the shaft, but Quinlen says that the shoemaker is temporarily useful as an alibi--his disappearance will make him appear to be the thief, and if things do not go well, Sgt. Henry J. can claim to be meek Ben's hostage rather than a deserter. Ben complains, 'You cannot dispose of my life like it was a chess piece,' to which Quinlen replies, 'No? You do everything right, you have some hope. Do anything wrong, and I'll guarantee you pain.' As Quinlen digs his fingers into the pressure points near Ben's neck, causing Ben to sink to his knees, Quinlen continues, 'You understand pain?'Hilb wants to divvy but Doc Quinlen says he will bury the gold. Henry J. must step between Quinlen and Hilb to prevent a fight. The sergeants face says he is no happier with this plan than Hilb, but his words say, 'That's alright with me.' Quinlen will make a map showing where the gold is, and the three men will meet in the town of Delores in a couple of weeks to divide the loot. Hilb says, 'I may get there just a little earlier,' and Quinlen says, 'If you do, don't let me see you.' Hilb brays like a billy-goat to express his displeasure.Fast forward a couple of weeks: Two cowboys on horseback ride into town past a sign that reads, Delores.'So the town of Delores, that morning in May
Was in for an infamous day.'In a saloon in Delores we first meet Lewton Cole (James Coburn) dealing Three Card Monte to the bartender (Jay Ose) for the price of a cold glass of fresh milk. Cole is setting up the two cowpokes who have just arrived from the range. Enter Quinlen, who owes a gambling debt to Cole. Cole has pinched Quinlen's wallet claiming he is entitled to interest on the debt. When Quinlen shows concern only about one twenty dollar bill, which has written upon it in large letters, 'Mex' above a line, and in smaller letters, 'X Integrity' below the line, followed by an arrow along side three dots, followed by 'W #3', Cole deduces that this particular twenty-dollar note has significance beyond its monetary value. Angry that Cole now knows something, Quinlen challenges Cole to a shootout at sundown, and storms out of the bar.The bartender solemnly hands Cole his glass of milk, and observes that Cole has opened his mouth to the wrong man. Quinlen is a quick draw who will 'cut your pocket out as soon as you start to reach.' Cole replies, 'It does look like I stepped in it a bit,' sniffs the milk, and sits back down at the card table.One of the cowpokes (Buzz Henry) has used the distraction of the exchange between Quinlen and Cole to bend the edge of the Queen of Spades so that when the game of Three Card Monte resumes, he will know which card is the queen. The cowboy wins successive hands, so Cole quits. The cowboy, sensing that he cannot lose, begs Cole to continue, so Cole raises the stakes. He asks the cowpoke how much money he has, and agrees to play one more hand for the man's entire stake, as well as the stake of his buddy. Cole asks, Now you sure you want to do this? and the grinning cowboys eagerly nod, Yes. Their smiles evaporates when Cole's deal reveal that all three cards now have identically bent corners.Sundown has arrived, and as Cole moves to rake in all of the cowpokes money, Quinlen is heard calling out Cole from the street. Knowing that his life can be measured in minutes, because he will surely be shot dead in the street, Cole remarks, Lucky in cards, unlucky in love, then asks, Did I wash you out, boys? and graciously tosses them a few coins.Cole moves to the bar, and drops a few coins for the bartender, who, grave at the prospect of what is about to unfold, slides the coins back to Cole. Cole slides them once more to the bartender, gestures toward the cowpokes, and says, Buy the boys a drink.Cole leaves the saloon, preparing to meet his maker. The soundtrack is a rumble of dirge-like drums. Quinlen taunts Cole from far down the street You're yellow, Cole. Lets get on with it. The doomed man forthrightly moves to his horse, ostensibly for a handgun with which to participate in the duel. Instead, he pulls a rifle and, from 100 yards, guns down Quinlen.Against an early evening sky, Cole moves to Quinlen's lifeless body; out of respect, Cole doffs his Stetson, shakes his head as if to say, What a shame, and then removes the cash from the dead mans inside breast pocket.You don't draw with a stranger if he's faster than you.
You've sung your last ditty,
You've kissed your last pretty
And played your last hand if you do.As Cole rides off, Hilb emerges to stand over Quinlen's body. He rakes his spurs over the sprawled mans chest and kicks his thigh to confirm he is dead, doffs his hat, and emits his trademark billy-goat bray. Hilb replaces his hat and watches Cole ride into the darkening evening. Cole, bathed in the red glow of dusk silhouetted against a purple sky, examines the map and gazes toward the horizon.When fate is the dealer you raise or you call;
A chance-takin man plays the cards as they fall.
A map worth a killin is worth tracking down,
So off to Integrity Town.The next day, a column of Army cavalry led by Capt. Shipley, cantors past a sign above a water trough, Integrity 8 miles. When the cavalry has passed, Lewton Cole surfaces from being submerged in the water trough, sputters to regain the breath he has been holding, and resumes shaving and puffing a cigar.In the town of Integrity, Sheriff John (Carroll O'Connor) and his deputy (Bruce Dern), are discussing the sheriffs reelection bid, and the accounts of the heist in the newspaper. Everyone seems to think that Shoemaker Ben has taken the gold and hightailed it to Mexico. The sheriff has some ideas about how to recover the gold and wishes he had a nice theft to investigate. The deputy observes that Sheriff John has a habit of bringing thieves back dead and bringing back only half of the loot. The sheriff says, Half is better than none, aint it? He shares with his deputy that he had once planned to pull off a gold robbery, but had to give it up because he got elected sheriff. But Im gonna tell ya, if this job weren't so sweet and soft, I might just elect to follow the criminal profession. His deputy observes, You'd be real good [at it] too, John.Cole arrives in Integrity on the back of a wagon, carrying his saddle. His horse has gone lame. He moves to the sheriff and deputy to inquire about buying a new mount. The deputy tell Cole that the sheriff owns the best horse in the county, Old Blue, but the sheriff says the horse is not for sale.Cole, whose face is on a Wanted for Murder poster on the wall, tricks the two lawmen, and locks them in the sheriffs own jail, where he forces them to strip naked. In response to Sheriff Johns question, Why you doin this terrible thing to me? Cole dryly remarks, A naked sheriff makes a slow posse. As he leaves, he says, Being found locked naked, in your own jail, in an election year. Now, to be too noisy about it might be bad politics. Shhh. The deputy looks down at himself and then at the sheriff and says, He sure left us bare, followed by his signature phrase, Ain't that right, John?Cut to the sheriff's ranch outside of town, where the sheriffs fetching daughter, Billee (Margaret Blye), needs three more eggs for the batter of the chocolate cake she is making. She calls for the Mexican stable-hand, Francisco (Alex Tinne), but he is taking a siesta.A yellow-haired woman is early to bloom;
Her laughter is roses, her smile is perfume.
But the child of a lawman can die on the vine
With no man to taste of her wine.So, Billee enters the barn, where the hens nest and Old Blue is stabled, to find Cole changing his drawers. She smiles at Cole, and he returns the smile. Billee is then all business: Alright, what are you doin here? Cole says, Puttin on my pants. She asks, Well, what do you want? and he says, Well, I was gonna get on this big black horse and ride him outta here, butBillee moves toward the door, but Cole cuts her off. She says, Look. Im not alone. Cole points to where the stableman is sleeping in the shade, What? Francisco? What is he gonna do, challenge me to a duel? He dont have a gun. Billee says, Well my daddy does, and he's the sheriff of this county. Cole says, Yeah, I know; I seen him, and then eyeing Billees fine form, says, You must take after your momma. She buttons up her dress, and Cole reciprocates by unbuttoning his shirt. She informs him, You're gonna have to take it, and a wrestling match ensues. When he has her where he wants her, he says, Easy now; you're supposed to wear yourself out lovin not fightin. She gasps, You can't do it this way, and he says, Slow. Slow. Easy. He kisses her, and she returns the kiss.Some minutes later, a rooster crows, and Cole exits the barn leading Old Blue, and mounts him.Its the Code of the West: you don't leave for tomorrow,
The Code of the West, what can be done today.As Cole departs, Billee, disheveled, wistfully emerges from the barn.Its the Code of the West, its a true fact of livin
What's lovingly given will lovingly come back your way.Sheriff John arrives home, and orders his Mexican servant, Francisco to get Old Blue saddled. The sheriff, obviously preoccupied with the preparations to pursue Cole, notices his daughters disheveled condition and asks if she is all right. She is not sure. She says, I think he raped me. Incredulous, the sheriff asks, Who? Francisco? Billee says, dreamily, He was big. And tall, then remembering herself, adds, and mean, and cruel. Francisco interrupts, Padron. Blue. He is gone. What do you mean gone? and Billee says, I tried to tell you. Sheriff John, starting to get the picture, asks Billee, Wait a minute; was your man wearing a gamblers coat and a little brown vest, to which Billee replies, Part of the time. As the painful reality sinks in, the sheriff growls, Cole. The man must hate me personal.Sheriff John prepares to mount an ornery mule to pursue. He took my Big Blue out in that desert. Billee protests, Oh Daddy! Is that all you care about? The sheriff, eager to get after Cole, says to his daughter, Aw Billee, now Ill make it up to you. You know a man picks his pleasure from the nearest tree. Why if you weren't my own daughter--I mean there's worse things. He could've killed you. Now that a been worse, wouldn't it, I think. She angrily says, You bring him back. Yeah, I'll bring him back. My election to a third term as sheriff depends on it. And my honor. YOUR honor? Oh, darlin, I can only keep my mind on one offense at a time.The scene shifts to Cole on Old Blue:The desert was losin its fight with the sun,
As Cole stopped for water at hole #1.
Just what was he chasin he'd sure like to know,
But he still had him two holes to go.Oh the Code of the West: show your backside to evil.
The Code of the West, give the devil his due.
The Code of the West, you gotta do unto others
Do unto others before they do it unto you.The sheriff is checking the trail, but is having difficulty with the mule.Now rapin and killin ain't really so bad.
But stealing Ol Blue, now that made Sheriff John mad.
You don't help yourself to the eggs in the nest
Of a man with a badge on his vest.Sheriff John arrives at Hole #1. He says to the mule, Two waterholes to go. Were gonna get him at one of them. He dips his hat in the brackish water, and asks the mule, Do you want any. He takes a sip and says, Well, it ain't too bad. It ain't gonna get any better at the next one either.Nightfall. We see Old Blue meandering through the desert with Cole asleep in the saddle. The horse finds its own way to Waterhole #2.Poor tumbleweed stumblin from boulder to stone
Your permanent address is places unknown.
You eat when you're hungry, you drink when you're dry
If wishes were eagles, you'd fly.Cole makes camp beside Waterhole #2, puffs on his cigar, and doodles a stick in the dying embers of his fire. He covers the shallow pit with desert dirt, spreads his blanket over the now dead but still warm fire bed and curls up to sleep. Sheriff John, a few miles behind, is also done for the day.Rest your head on your saddle; dream of fortune and fame.Meanwhile, Billee sighs in her bed, and then moves toward the window.When the winds in the willow
A girl hugs her pillow
And wishes that she knew his name.Sunrise. Cole is back in the saddle, breathing in the desert air, and heading for Waterhole #3. A few hours later, the sheriff arrives at Cole's camp, and carefully examines a cigar butt that he has removed from the sand.Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Billee saddles her sorrel, and heads into the desert at the gallop. Cole surveys the landscape and rides on. The sheriff, hot on Coles heels, is still having trouble with the mule, who throws him into a sand dune. Spitting sand, John says, Damn mule, followed by his signature line, I wish you hadn't done that.Cole has arrived at his destination, and is wading waist-deep, peering at the bottom of Waterhole #3. Cole finds the strongbox, lugs it to dry land, when he becomes aware of another presence; he turns and is staring down the barrel of Sheriff Johns rifle. Good morning, Sheriff.Go ahead, go for that gun. I wish you'd go for that gun.Well, I don't need to now, sheriff. I got all of yours.Cole bends to open the box. The sheriff kneels with him, and reads the words on the box, Property of the U.S. Army, and asks, What's in it, General Grant's head? Cole guesses its bullion--the proceeds of the robbery in the news. If it is, its over a hundred pounds of that fine yellow gold.Cole fiddles with the lock. The sheriff says, You just get up outta there. Ill get it open. What the hell, Sheriff. I found it; I get to open it. Again, Cole gets the jump on John with his derringer, which he points at John's chest. Abruptly, Cole trains the pistol on the lock, fires, and holsters his gun. The two men gleefully discover the contents of the Army's strongbox.John regains the advantage. He permits Cole to change into dry britches, and asks him what the gold might fetch in Mexico. I imagine those thieves, if they got across the river without sinking too deep in the sand, and got by those Mexican bandits, and they knew how to make a deal down there, I imagine those thieves might get in upwards to a hundred thousand dollars.The sheriff relieves Cole of his stingy little gun, and has Cole arrange the gun's chain properly in the sheriff's vest pocket. Cole says, A little touch of gold always looks good on a man. The sheriff replies, Now I got something that will look good on you, and applies handcuffs. Cole says, I might just sue you for false arrest. I didn't break any law, Sheriff.No? What about stealin my horse?
I needed that horse to recover the gold.
Lockin me in my own jail?
I wanted you behind me.
Murder?
Self defense.
Rapin?
Assault with a friendly weapon?Cut to Billee, struggling to follow the trail, but determined.Now treat a girl tender, shell preen like a bride,
But take her for granted, she'll come for your hide.
She'll shoot off your head if you leave her behind,
And you'll lose your natural mind.The sheriff is bringing Cole back to Integrity. As the two men travel, the sheriff points out, Even if they don't stretch your neck, you'll be wearing a number into the twentieth century. Cole says, I got a number for you, Sheriff: one hundred and eight pounds of yellow gold in that saddlebag. You show me an honest sheriff and I'll show you a man without money.Cut to Sgt. Henry J. and Hilb, with Shoemaker Ben in tow, also on the trail of the man who stole the map. Back to Cole and the sheriff: Cole continues to use his magic tongue to turn the sheriff into an accomplice:You know, a man with money, he don't touch the principal.
He don't?
No. He lives off the interest. And there'll be lots of interest. He'll subscribe to a little railroad stock, or some cotton futures, maybe some corn, tobacco, sugar, wheat--all from his ranch, where he's got a fancy saloon and his own private gambling hall for a watering hole. And all them sloe-eyed senoritas just a hungerin...
After my money.
True, John, but you will wear out before you go broke.John and Cole stop for a meager lunch of beef jerky. While admiring the beauty of the desert, they share stories of their lives, their career choices and their loves; they bond.Sheriff: How come at your age a fella like you ain't tied down yet?
Cole: Well I was. Once.
What'd you do to her?
Well, I don't know, just got on separate trains, I guess.
That thing with Billee, course not being there I'll never really know, but what was that all about?
Just a hasty love affair. Nothing got bruised but her pride.
Well, you should have stayed to talk a bit. I always talk about five minutes before I run. You left her upside down.
Don't think on it, John. Think about something important like getting our gold to Mexico.John does not object to the concept of our gold. They are now partners, although when Cole lights John's cigar, we note that he is still wearing the handcuffs. Cole sings, Going back, going back, to Durango, and John joins him, where the sun goes down at noon.John and Cole continue on their way, talking. You always been wearin that badge? No, we ran cows after that big dry-up in 73. Cole responds, Yeah, we had some cattle until the government started taxin public land. The sheriff: Well, if it ain't the drought, if it ain't the hoof-n-mouth, the black leg, or the government throwin its hook into everything, it's always some damn thing, always. You're right there, John, and Cole gestures toward trouble: Sgt. Henry J., Hilb and the shoemaker have caught them.Hilb orders the shoemaker to search the men and remove their guns. As the shoemaker reaches for the watch chain attached to the derringer, the sheriff says, It's only a watch. Hilb says, I want it, whereupon the shoemaker turns the guns he has removed from the sheriff on Hilb, who spits and says, Drop them guns or I'll kill ya, and Ben, shaking like a leaf, drops them.Hilb is ready to shoot Cole, the sheriff, and Ben, but Henry convinces Hilb that murder at this juncture would not be advisable. Hilb points his gun at Ben, He knows everything, that shoemaker. Henry replies, What do we care; we'll be swappin tequilas with Ortiz at the presidential palace. Hilb points his gun at Cole, He killed Quinlen. Henry says, Well, you should thank him; you get a bigger cut. Now, ya see how everything works out? Turning to Cole, Henry asks, Not that it matters but, how did you know about Quinlen? Cole replies, You got time for a long story, sergeant? Henry smiles and says, Nah. Cuff em, shoemaker, on their ankles.Hilb says, We divvy, and Henry says, Why not. He throws a cord to the shoemaker to tie the men back-to-back. Henry moves the gold to his saddlebag, but first hugs it.Sweet yellow, sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold,
You make a man fever, you make a man bold.
Youre won like a woman, a treasure to hold,
Sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold.Henry stares at the bullion, Kind of makes your tongue coat up, and Hilb brays like a billy-goat. In the distance, the cavalry column gallops by. Henry says, My old outfit. To Cole and the sheriff, tied together, Bye now. The thieves mount, and as they depart with the gold and the horses, Henry says to Cole and John, As we used to say in the cavalry, Without a horse, a man's afoot.You make a man fever, you make a man bold
Sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold.Cut to Billee on her horse, checking the ground for signs of the track.Cut back to Cole and John struggling to free themselves, while Cole tells the long story that the sergeant did not have time for. And there was this twenty dollar bill with a bunch a doodlin on it. I didn't know what it was until Ol Quinlen made it important by not lettin me go without a shootout. Asked why he didn't stick around to clear his name, Cole says, I don't know, John. I guess I was just in a hurry to see what this man was so willin to die over. The sheriff says, The way things are gonna work out, you're gonna be a hero, and I'm gonna be the town jackass.Unknown to the two struggling men, Billee has arrived on the scene, but remains in the background while the sheriff complains about where Cole's finger is. Billee says, Well now, look at that. Thats something you don't see everyday: two big men, way out here in the middle of the desert, playin grapple-finger. When ordered by her father to cut out the smart talk and get over here and cut us loose, Billee says, Maybe, approaches, and delivers roundhouse blows to the belly of each man.She mounts her horse to go find me some Indians or some red fire ants. The sheriff, with Coles advice, tries to mollify her. I promise you this man, but I gotta have him first. Now you see that, don't you? Its a point of honor, and my duty. Billee, listen to me, I know I'm a fool and a sinner, but it's only your poor dad you'd be turnin loose if you did it. Billee. She reluctantly gets off her horse to help.The only knife is in the front pocket of Cole's britches. She reaches her fingers in and Cole encourages her. Deeper. She frees her father, but refuses to untie, Cole. Instead, she cocks a gun at him. Cole says tenderly, Go ahead [and shoot me]. It was worth it. She looks him in the eyes, and asks, What's your name anyway? and John says, Aw, Billee, quit foolin around. Here, gimme that gun. John takes the gun, saying, His name is Lewton Cole. I thought you knew him.All three climb aboard Billee's horse. As they start off, Cole asks, Where are we goin, John? and the sheriff says, Integrity guards the pass to Mexico, don't it? Well, our best chance is if they lay over in Integrity. Billee, seated between the two men, squirming, says, What about my rape! to which John says, Forget about it. Were after gold!The three alternate positions: one walking and two riding, then the men walking, until nightfall finds Billee and Cole on the horse, with John walking alongside, leading the horse. Cole hugs Billee. Billee says, I should have shot you back there, and Cole laughs and says, You never woulda shot me, and she says, right in that deep pocket. The sheriff smiles. Cole asks, What did you want me to do anyway, bring you candies and flowers? and she says, No. I wanted you to do the decent thing, and Cole asks, Which is what? and she says, Well, if you don't know, what's the use of talking. Cole: What does that mean? Billee: Think about it. Cole laughs and says, Oh, no, Billee, we don't want to start thinking about it. That takes us too far from the point of it all. She looks back and asks, What's that mean? and Cole says, Think about it.Well she thought, and he thought, and like it or not,
The colder she acted, the warmer he got.The horse takes a misstep and the three are thrown, with Cole and Billee tumbling down an embankment, and Cole ending face-to-face on top of her. She says, Has anybody ever said anything about your style? John yells, Thats your fault, Cole. If you hadn't a been doin what you oughtn't a back there, this never woulda happened. Come on Billee, get out from under him, and lets get goin.The thieves have arrived at the outskirts of Integrity. Sgt. Henry J. tells Hilb to stay to guard our flank, while he and the shoemaker head for the hotel, and then to a brothel operated by Lavinia (Joan Blondell). Ben plays the organ, while Lavinia greets Henry. He opens his saddle bag to give her a peek, and she says, Looks like you robbed the Army. He asks, Do I have the house for the night? and she says, Your credit seems good. The place is empty of other customers because the town council is meeting and the sheriff is out chasing a man who locked him in his own jail, and in a very unusual condition.Henry moves to the eight prostitutes and says, All right girls, and in military fashion, Present arms! whereupon the women descend on Henry, squealing with delight. Henry kisses as many as he can.Hilb, at his post outside of town, spots the approaching three on horseback, and hightails it to the hotel, where he barricades himself in an upstairs room. The sheriff, Cole and Billee, riding at the gallop, are again thrown, this time in front of a desert shack. The man inside, pokes his head out the window and says, Get the hell off my lawn.They run into town, and the sheriff exclaims, Cole, there's Old Blue, tied up in front of the hotel. Cole is carrying Billee over his shoulder, his hand firmly on her butt, as she yells, Put me down! Put me down! The sheriff says, Put her down before she wakes up the whole town. Cole: You're gonna have to tell me why you named her Billee. John: Her ma and me was tryin to make a boy. Cole: Well, you didn't even come close.They enter the hotel, check the register, and ask George, the hotel clerk (Robert Cornthwaite) about the men registered as Smith and Wesson in 301. The sheriff asks the clerk for his guns. The clerk hands a pistol to the sheriff, saying, I've got one of two Colts were taken off of John Wesley Hardin by Constable John Selman after he shot Hardin behind the right ear in the Acme Saloon in El Paso on a Monday afternoon.The clerk produces a second handgun: This 32 caliber rimfire Hopkins & Allen was almost smuggled in to Bill Longley before they hanged him high, October 11, 1878, in Giddings, Lee County, Texas. Cole: Does it shoot? The clerk: Beautifully. Cole: Thank you very much, George. Ill try and return it in the same condition.The sheriff and Cole move upstairs.When a showdowns a comin, when a shootout is due,In the lobby, George says to Billee, Oh, I forgot to tell them. The big and the little one checked in, stayed long enough to get some stuff, and then went right out.Billee: Where'd they go?
George: Well, you know...
Billee: Lavinia's! As Billee runs upstairs, George says, Did I mention the scary one?Face up to the danger, throw a slug in a stranger
Before he throws one into you.Billee delivers the current situation to Cole and her father. Cole asks her to go downstairs to ask George for the key to 302, opposite the room in which Hilb is holed up. Billee tells Cole to go down himself, whereupon her father kicks her in the butt and tell her to go on down like you're told and get that there key. As Billee moves away rubbing the place where she has been kicked, Cole observes, She sure moves fine, and the sheriff says, Aw Cole, dammit.At Lavinia's, Henry is having a good old time, while Lavinia herself takes an interest in Ben. He tells her the story of his abduction, and says, I am getting ideas. Lavinia cautions him: Don't get reckless, Robert. He corrects her, Ben.Meanwhile, the sheriff and Hilb eye each other's hotel room doors through their respective keyholes. Cole has taken a position at the window to monitor Hilbs only route of escape. Billee tries to tell her father her side of what occurred in the barn, but John dismisses her with, Not now, Billee. She says, Daddy, don't you care? Doesn't it mean anything? which he ignores, and asks Cole, You reckon he's still in there? Billee moves to Cole and demands to know, What have you done to us? to which Cole replies, Believed your eyes and not your words, Billee. She says, All right. If nobody cares, I don't, and flops on her back on the bed. Cole reacts to her implied offer, and John scowls, Not now, Cole.At Lavinia's, Henry, laughing and wearing a pink garter as a headband, heads upstairs with two of the women, while the others wave. Lavinia takes Ben upstairs.In the hotel room, John is impatient. He asks Cole to tell him again about living off the interest, but Cole says, You gotta grow your own dream. Suddenly worried, John asks Cole if he is thinking of giving him some kind of second-card deal. Cole says, I'm not dealin this hand.You gotta do unto others, do unto others, before they do it unto you.The standoff continues until dawn. A drunk cowpoke, (Buzz Henry, who is also the film's stuntman) rides his horse beneath Hilb's hotel window. Hilb drops a note on his head, written on a pillowcase, HELP HELP. I'm a prisoner in room 301. FiFi LaFlame.The cowboy rides his horse into the hotel lobby, runs upstairs, and is taken by Hilb at gunpoint as a hostage to shield Hilb's escape. In the lobby, Hilb mounts the horse and, amid gunfire from Cole and the sheriff, gallops toward Lavinia's. In his haste, he drops his share of the gold in the middle of the street. As gunfire is raining down, he cannot retrieve the fallen treasure.The sound of the shootout awakens the denizens of the brothel. Whatever Ben and Lavinia have been doing together invigorates Ben and makes him reckless. The sergeant comes downstairs, but is almost struck by bullets from a crazed Hilb, who is returning fire at anything that moves.Crying, My gold! My gold! Hilb wheels his horse, and continues shooting until, out of ammo, he rides out of the movie, crying and braying like a billy-goat.The sheriff moves to retrieve the saddlebag containing half of the gold. Henry takes a shot at him, but retreats. Cole gallops toward John on Old Blue, and dismounts. John places the saddlebag on the horse, and says, Well that's it. I got mine. Cole says, Thats good John. Now you can help me get mine. The sheriff is preparing to leave, and Cole says, Hell, this hand isn't over yet, is it? The sheriff says, All right, Cole, and the two plan how they will attack Henry.Henry is creating a defensive position in Lavinia's, destroying the brothel in the process. Lavinia desperately saves a painting of a younger version of herself, and tells Henry he will have to pay for the damages. He replies, as he frantically moves furniture to create a barricade, I always pick up my broken glass, and tells Lavinia that she has to talk the sheriff out of this fight.The condition of the premises does not improve as Cole and the sheriff take the gunfight inside. Using shotguns, they are taking out doors, walls, mirrors and chandeliers wholesale. When Lavinia screams, You are about to shoot-up my meal ticket, the sheriff says, while reloading, This is official business. I'll get the town council to pay for any refurbishments.As the fusillade intensifies, and a piece of pottery explodes, Lavinia cries, That vase was brought around the horn! This is a home, not just a house, you bastards!During a momentary lull, as the men reload, Cole calls for a hiatus, so We can talk a spell. Henry asks, What's your proposition? The sheriff responds, Your life for that gold. That's the proposition. Well? Henry says, I'm thinkin about it. Do you know how hard I had to work for that gold? The sheriff says, Ain't that terrible, Cole? Why, in another minute he'll have us believin he earned it.Henry then sees out the window Shoemaker Ben being lowered in a sling made of bed sheets. The hookers are helping him escape with the remaining gold. Henry runs outside, and the other two follow. The shooting continues, as Henry is both pursuing Ben and protecting his own hide. John has a strategy, and Cole reluctantly agrees to attempt to execute the more dangerous maneuver.While Ben was playin steal the gold, and make your getaway,
The other three played shoot-em-up and turnabout's fair play.
But Ben had tasted painted lips and heard the sirens song,
So he could hardly keep from goin wrong.From the upstairs windows, the hookers are signaling to Ben with their undergarments to assist his escape.Its the Code of the West: heed the word of your sisters;
The Code of the West, make a left turn from sin.
The Code of the West, keep an eye on temptation; recite the quotation
That says, When-Satan-calls-your-name-it doesn't-matter-how-you-play-the game-cause-all-he-cares-about-is
Did you win?Henry pursues Ben to an outhouse; Ben slugs Henry in the face with the saddlebag filled with gold, and is able to escape. Cole and John are destroying the shack with their shotguns, so that Henry is forced to use a woman's corset to waive the white flag of surrender.Cole demands, Sergeant, where's the gold? and Henry points to the shoemaker mounting Old Blue. All the gold is now reunited on the horse with Ben.Now Cole and John and Henry J. were feelin mighty sad,As Shoemaker Ben escapes on John's horse with the gold, the sheriff says, Oh Blue! Hell let anybody ride him.To bank a little sack of gold, could turn a good man bad,
But when you pick the meek and mild against the brave and bold
The meek inherit all the Army's gold.The three men have forgotten their fight, and join forces to pursue Ben. Billee, on foot, yells, Hey wait for me! and runs to the livery.Now, in the meantime Billee-girl was schemin on her own.
She knew a healthy sweet young thing can't live by bread alone.Billee emerges from the livery stable on her own mount at the gallop.To play the tricky game of life a woman needs a plan.
To play the game of love she needs a man.Ben has ridden Old Blue into the encampment of the cavalry. His three pursuers also gallop into the hands of the Army. Cpl. Blye summons Capt. Shipley from his tent, who dons his cap: Well, what have we here? Corporal Blye, put Sgt. Foggers, Henry J., U.S. Cav., under arrest immediately, and to Henry, You were supposed to be guarding the Army's gold.Henry salutes, Sgt. Foggers, Henry J., reporting sir! He took me as a hostage until I got the best of him; pointing at Ben, The foreign shoemaker, sir.Ben stutters trying to defend himself. Capt. Shipley, Well it fits. It was his tunnel. Sgt. Foggers, if this is true, the Army has lost a deserter and gained a hero.Shipley continues, Cpl. Blye, arrest Lewton Cole for the murder of Doc Quinlen.Cole: Oh captain, captain, sir. Self defense. See, Doc Quinlen found out that I found out that shoemaker and him was plannin that whole gold robbery. I was forced to do it to save the Army's gold.Capt. Shipley: Well, Mr. Cole, if what you say is true, you're in for a nice reward. Turning to the sheriff, Honest John, did all of this transpire as my sergeant and Mr. Cole have related?John: Ah yes, captain. You might say these men were acting as my deputies in the recovery of the gold.Shipley moves toward the sheriff, No reward for us professionals, eh, John? Of course, you'll get your recognition come election time. Corporal Blye! Arrest the foreigner.Ben: I am innocent. I am the only innocent.Capt. Shipley, laughing, They all say that, don't they John?Ben: I was the hostage.Sheriff, sharing the captains laugh: Ain't that terrible, captain?Ben: It is hopeless.Capt. Shipley: Hopeless, eh? You are asking me to doubt appearances. He points at Henry, The Army; at John, The Law, and at Cole, Professional enterprise. Corporal Blye! Haul him away. Careful, he's a dangerous man.Ben refuses to be handled: No man hauls Ben Akajanian. I walk free; alone. Thank you.As Ben is led away, the captain smiles at Henry, Sgt. Foggers, and walks toward him, Henry J., where is the Army's gold?Its in the saddlebag, sir, but there is nothing there except rocks. Get that shoemaker back here!Billee arrives at the camp. Capt. Shipley greets her, What a pleasure to see you here, Miss Billee.She points at Cole: Arrest that man, but the captain says, It turns out that it was a case of self defense.Billee says, I don't care about that. He forced his affections on me.Captain Shipley and Cole exchange smiles, Miss Billee, there is not a court in the land who would convict with a ravishing beauty like you for a witness. And who on the jury would not do the same thing if given the chance.Bens response to interrogation is stony silence. Everyone leaves to find where Ben has stashed the gold, leaving only Billee and Ben in the Army camp. Billee asks Ben, Do you trust me? Cole backtracks in time to see Billee gallop off, leaving Ben alone.Now Lewton Cole knew Billee had some mighty fetchin ways
Ole Ben would tell her everything, and still get ninety days.Billee cantors to a spot in the desert near some boulders.Beneath the rock, beside the trail, that leads to Mexico,
You'll find yourself a hundred pounds, or so.Its the Code of the West: every girl needs a dowry.Billee finds the gold and smiles, Now I've got you, Lewton Cole.The Code of the West, and it don't matter who.Billee loads two of the four bars of bullion into the saddlebag on Old Blue.The Code of the West, when a girl's pushin twenty, shes got to give plentyBillee picks up the other two bars, kisses one of them, and loads them on the horse.To end up with rice in her shoe.A hand holding a small bouquet of native goldenrod enters the foreground of the frame. Cole's voice: Hello there, Billee honey.Billee: You! What are you doin here?
Cole: I just come lookin after you.
Billee: You're after the gold.
Cole: Oh well, that too, but uh, What about partners?
Billee: What kind of partners?
Cole: What kind of partners did you have in mind?
Billee: Full time.Cole takes a moment to think over this proposition, then asks, You take me like I am?Billee melts, walks over to Cole, takes the flowers, smells them, smiles, removes Cole's hat, and kisses him. The two sink out of the frame, leaving the camera unfocused on the desert hills.The cavalry, seen from overhead, cantors on its way to the sound of a bugle. Cut to Ben sitting forlornly on a rock; Lavinia's carriage arrives, driven by her houseman, The Prince (Rupert Crosse). Ben, relieved, says Lavinia. I thought you would never get here. Lavinia smiles, and Ben gets in the carriage. They ride to where Ben hid the gold. The cavalry is also riding to the spot where the gold has been hidden.Cut to Lewton Cole donning his jacket, and placing goldenrod in the band of his hat.Well, Cole had a few other things left to do,
He flowered his Stetson, and boarded Ol Blue.Billee (naked): Hey! Wait a minute! Where ya goin?
Cole (on his horse): Durango. Thats the way I am. Bye bye.The rougher you treat em, the stronger they grieve.Billee, now dressed, reclines on a rock watching Cole in the distance riding off.And the longer they watch when you leave.The sheriff and the sergeant arrive at Billees location and circle her on their horses, but ignore her, asking each other where they are headed. Lavinia's carriage arrives. The sergeant yells to Ben, Hey shoemaker, are you gonna tell us where the gold is? Lavinia pulls a gun, points it at John and Henry, and says, Go and get it, Ben.As Ben gets out of the carriage, the Army arrives. Shipley demands, Where is the Army's gold?Ben: 'Where is it, Miss Billee?'Billee uses the goldenrod bouquet whose aroma she has been admiring to point toward Lewton Cole, who can be seen riding Old Blue on the rim of a distant ridge.Old Mexico is just ahead, so gambler move along.
There ain't nobody there to care if you did right or wrong.
You shot a thief, you found some gold, you stole a kiss or two,
And the world's a better place because of you.Oh the Code of the West: When you're drinkin tequila,

He clashes with one of the new settlers, Lije Evans, who doesn't quite appreciate Tadlock's ways. Along the way, the families must face death and heartbreak and a sampling of frontier justice when one of them accidentally kills a young Indian boy.

At the same time, Godfrey Hanson (Christopher Lee) is checking cameras that are set to trigger with trip wires and a mirror. An old tramp (Sydney Bromley as Sidney Bromley) watches and comes to examine everything as soon as Hanson leaves.Angela gets a hot radiator and has to pull over. Tinker Mason (Kenneth Cope) in a van pulls up behind her and adds some anti-freeze to her radiator. He tells her the Swan Inn she is looking for is just down the road to the right. He leaves and she waits for the engine to cool. All at once she hears a high-pitched humming sound.The old tramp goes into his cave where he has been living, but is soon disturbed by a high-pitched humming sound. As it gets louder, something approaches him. He backs away and scrambles to get away from it as it gets closer to him.Angela is seen driving down the road. Hanson steps out onto the roadway just as she passes.Meanwhile at the Swan Inn, Dr. Vernon Stone (Peter Cushing) has been served an ale by Frankie Callum (Sarah Lawson). They listen as the weather forecast is given by a radio announcer. It is said that the temperature is unnaturally high for the island of Fara. They discuss how hot it is.Angela drives up to see Tinker and Bob Hayward (Thomas Heathcote as Tom Heathcote) sitting outside with drinks. They watch as she carries her suitcase inside.Angela asks for Jeff Callum (Patrick Allen) and is told he is away by his wife Frankie. Angela announces that she is Jeffs new secretary. Frankie offers to show her to her room, but Angela requests a drink. Dr. Stone introduces himself and says he will pay for the drink. Bob comes in, bringing the two beer mugs and asks for a refill. He is served one. Angela says she wants to finish her drink in her room. Frankie leads her upstairs to the room and places her suitcase on the bed. Opening the window, Frankie says how hot it is. She notices in Angelas suitcase a copy of Jeffs last novel. Angela says she thought she should read it since she will be working for him. In the bathroom she is observed putting perfume on her neck. Frankie tells her she will inform her husband when he returns.Hanson arrives and asks if Jeff has brought the parcel he is expecting. Frankie tells him he is not back yet. Hanson insists that Jeff deliver it to his room immediately when he gets back. After he goes to his room, Frankie and Dr. Stone discuss how rude Hanson is. Frankie talks about how mysterious Hanson is, going out each day, setting up cameras and staying in his room the rest of the time. Stone suggests it sounds like material for one of Jeffs novels.Jeff is driving to the inn. As he rounds a corner, Bob is standing there on his bicycle and there is almost a collision. Jeff gets out and questions what Bob is doing there in the middle of the road. Bob looks confused but apologizes, saying he was not thinking. Jeff asks if he is all right. Bob says he is, but that he heard something: a strange whirring noise. Jeff chalks it up to Bob having had one too many.Arriving at the Swan Inn, Jeff greets Ken Stanley (William Lucas) who just loaded something into his vehicle. They joke about the weather and Ken leaves.Inside, Jeff greets his wife, who asks about his trip. He says it was good except for almost running over Bob, who was in the middle of the road. Frankie says Bob was fine when he left here and gets Tinker to agree.Frankie asks about the parcel Jeff brought for Hanson. She tells him Hanson is impatient to receive it. Stone tells him Hanson demanded it be brought up to him right away. Jeff delivers it to Hanson, who rudely grabs it away and locks the door.Frankie tells Jeff that his new secretary has arrived and is staying at the Cove. Tinker offers Jeff a ride. When they get there, they see Angela on the beach in a bikini. She waves to Jeff, who starts down toward her. Tinker leaves.Jeff tells Angela that she had better leave right away. Their former affair led to no writing and almost wrecked his marriage. Angela tells him that he cant just love a girl and then leave. She asks what he will tell his wife (who doesnt know about them). Jeff says that is his problem.They hear the high-pitched whining and wonder what it is. After it dies down, Angela and Jeff kiss.Back at the Inn, Tinker helps Ben Siddle (Jack Bligh) inside as Jeff and Angela drive up. Hanson notices this from an upper window. They sit him down at a table and ask what is wrong. Dr. Stone comes in to examine him. Ben tells them that his sheep are all dead. They take him to a cot in another room. Hanson seems especially interested in what killed the sheep. He goes to his room and places a red lens on his camera. Then he loads it into a bag with some film and leaves. Dr. Stone gives a sedative to Ben and tells them to let him rest.Jeff calls Bens wife to tell her that Ben is not feeling well but he experiences some interference on the phone line. He is unable to complete the conversation and hangs up.Angela goes up to her room to take a bath. Jeff comes in and warns her not to reveal their affair to his wife. Suddenly Frankie comes in, bringing some towels to Angela. Jeff hides in the bathroom with Angela, who takes a towel from Frankie without giving away that Jeff is hiding. After Frankie leaves, Jeff warns Angela again. She is amused.Tinker tells Jeff that the television is having problems. There is static and technical interference. Jeff wonders if it is from static electricity built up by the heat. Meanwhile, Bob also notices trouble on his television and asks his wife Stella (Anna Turner) if she did anything to the set. She replies that she never touches it. Suddenly the television explodes. He tells his wife to get a dustpan and broom. Still examining the television wires, Bob hears the whirring noise and is maddened by the heat. Going out to his car, he drives in misery, crashing through a fence and going over a precipice. His car burns.Meanwhile in the kitchen, Angela cools herself with an ice cube. Frankie and Angela talk about why Jeff would come to live in an out-of-the-way place like Fara Island. Angela suggests that Jeff is running away from something. When Frankie tells her she doesnt know Jeff very well, Angela confesses to the affair. Frankie expresses shock and disbelief. Finally Angela tells her she was lying in anger.Hanson goes out at night to look at the dead sheep. He makes a photo of one sheep. Next he is seen removing a knife from a metal box.Jeff and Frankie are sitting on a patio table as Angela joins them. Talk of the heat turns to the question of whether Jeff has seen Bob. He hasnt. He hands over his manuscript to Angela to type. Frankie goes inside. Jeff lights a cigarette and Angela comes out, asking for a light. When he goes over to her, she feels his trembling hand and places it on her chest.  You know you want me,  she says.The whirring sound is heard again by both of them. Frankie comes out and tells them that she saw something landing that made a whining noise. They go out to the hill and see Hanson returning. Frankie questions what Hanson is doing. They see nothing and Jeff again questions Frankie about what she saw. He tells them to wait while he goes to look. They tell him they dont want to wait in the dark and to wait until morning. He says he is tired of Hansons sneaking around and will go ask him what he is up to.Hanson is developing film in his room under a red light when Jeff knocks on the door and calls to him. He refuses to open the door, and Jeff threatens to break it down. Hanson tells him to wait a few minutes, but Jeff kicks in the door. Hanson angrily shuts the door to protect the photographs from being exposed to the light. Jeff questions Hanson about what he is doing and why he was on the hill that night. When he mentions about a landing, Hanson is eager to know what was seen. Jeff confesses that it was his wife who saw it. Hanson tells Jeff that he has been investigating an alien invasion the past week and that this is the source of the heat. Jeff expresses doubt about this. Hanson tells him that he ruined the photos he was developing. They go out on location where Hanson has the cameras set up. He shows Jeff some black cinders which he says were burned by something hotter than anything on this planet. As Jeff goes to see about a dog whining at the fence, Hanson calls Jeff to see what broke through the fence. They look at Bobs burned car. Jeff says they must warn others about this, but Hanson says not yet. He wants time to gather new evidence to prove the aliens exist.At the Inn, an old man orders a beer and takes it to a table where an old woman sits. Angela comes downstairs and is seen by Tinker and Ken, who wants to know where the girl was hiding. She says she will go to work on the typing.Jeff and Hanson come into the Inn. Hanson goes up to his room, and Jeff orders a bottle of beer. Frankie asks what the matter is, but Jeff snaps that nothing is wrong. He says the heat is bothering everybody. Suddenly the bottles of beer begin to burst. Frankie gets cut by the shattering glass, and Jeff goes to get a first aid kit. He looks for it in the room where Angela is. She is told about the bursting bottles. He looks at her with her blouse open and cant resist kissing her. At this moment Frankie enters and sees them kissing.Tinker, now affected by the heat, comes in and attacks Angela. They struggle and he throws her onto the couch and tries to rape her. She jumps up and hits the floor, where he continues his attack until she is able to hit him on the head. Tinker flees just as Ken, Jeff and Frankie come in. Ken puts Angela on the bed and goes to get Dr. Stone. Jeff and Hanson run after Tinker. Jeff struggles with Tinker, telling him to come back with him to the Inn. Tinker hits Jeff with a stick and runs off. Hanson approaches and Jeff tells him that Tinker got the best of him.Tinker runs to his garage and lights a welding torch. Looking through the door to see who is coming, he is horrified by something approaching which gives off a bright light and a tremendous humming sound. Dropping the torch, he runs behind a car. The car falls as the door slowly opens, the light shining from outside. Tinker covers his ears as the noise grows unbearable and screams. When Hanson and Jeff arrive, they see only burnt areas and a tank from which all the energy has been drained by the aliens.Dr. Stone is discussing what happened with Tinker, saying it is unlikely under normal circumstances. Hanson says these circumstances are not normal. Frankie comes in just in time to hear Jeff say that two men have been killed. She wants to know who. Stone tells her that Tinker met with an accident. She asks Jeff who the other man was. He tells her it was Bob. Jeff is getting excited and Hanson tells him to remain calm. He tells Frankie and Stone that Hanson believes aliens are attacking them. Jeff says the temperature is now 108 and the telephones are out. Stone suggests they go to the relay station where they can radio for help. He offers to go. Hanson brings him a two-way radio to keep in touch with them.Stone reports over the radio that the car is overheating. As he gets close to the station, the car stalls and he says he will have to walk the rest of the way. As he is looking at the car engine, he is approached by an alien force which produces the loud droning sound and emits a bright light. Stone screams as it closes in on him. Hanson and the others can only listen in shock.Jeff volunteers to go next, but Hanson convinces him that he is better equipped to deal with them. He gets the car keys and tells them to lock all doors and windows. Angela screams and Jeff runs to comfort her. She says she must have had a dream. The man was attacking her. He comforts her as Frankie looks on. She leaves the room, lost in thought. Jeff comes out and Frankie confronts him about knowing the girl before. He denies it at first, but finally admits he knew her before and that they moved here to get away from her. Frankie asks if he loves her. He admits that it was strictly a physical attraction and that his love is for his wife. He calls Angela a slut and admits that he wanted her.Angela comes out and wants the doctor. Jeff tells her the doctor cant come. She insists that she needs him. Finally under duress Frankie tells her the doctor is dead. Angela seems distraught.Hanson arrives at Stones car and finds the battery drained. He finds the radio and calls Jeff to report that Stone is dead, burnt up. He also sees a glowing light in the stone quarry and is going in. Jeff tells him to be careful.Hanson sees Stella and her dog searching with a flashlight. He thinks to warn her, but suddenly she and the dog cry out and flames are seen. Hanson retreats to the car, dropping his flashlight, which goes out. At that moment he realizes the aliens are attracted to the light. He calls Jeff and tells him to put out all the lights at the Inn. He says he will drive to the station with no lights on.At the station we see the radar operator (Barry Halliday) as he notices disturbances on the radar screen. He goes to call someone on the phone and the screen explodes. [This scene was also shown at the beginning of the film, just before the titles.] The electrical circuits crackle and pop. The droning sound becomes very loud and the aliens light reflects on the face of the screaming radar operator.Jeff, Frankie and Angela get restless and decide to drive to the station in Angelas car. Meanwhile, Gerald Foster (Percy Herbert), Hanson and Ken are viewing the burned out control room at the station. Ken says the radar operator was burned to a crisp. Hanson tells them that the aliens were attracted to us through the signals we send into space. Needing an energy source, they were drawn here in energy waves and materialized like a television image. Ken says we must destroy them before they destroy us. They go to get some explosives near the quarry.Jeff says the car is about to fail. Suddenly they run off into a ditch. Angela runs into the road and lies down just as Ken drives up. Jeff comes and they stand Angela to her feet. Ken tells them the radar operator was burnt up. He helps them get the car out of the ditch.At the station Ken says he and Gerald will set the dynamite. Jeff questions using the dynamite, which will light the area and attract the aliens. Hanson argues that there are no other ideas. He tells them to watch for his signal flare gun.Jeff tells Ken to look after Angela if things turn bad so he can stay with Frankie. At that time the flare is shot and seen. They advance to the quarry, where Hanson is setting fires with his flare gun. More flares are shot into the sky by Ken and Jeff. All at once Gerald, who has been throwing dynamite at the creature (who is now visible as a glowing glob) gets stuck and cant get out from where he is. Hanson shouts for Gerald to get away, but he is unable. Dynamite blasts go off near the creature. Angela runs down toward the fires with Ken following her. He catches her and tells her to come back with him. She tries to get away, but he persuades her to follow him to a stone building outside the edge of the quarry. Inside, she tells him not to tell her what to do. She curses him but he tries to reassure her that they should not give up hope. As he looks out the window at the explosions, she eyes the gun in his pocket.As lightning and thunder are heard, Jeff shoots more flares and tells Frankie to stay close. Hanson runs up and warns about the storm. Suddenly the creature is seen coming toward Hanson. Jeff shouts for Hanson to run, but he is overcome by the creature. Inside, Angela grabs the gun and turns it on Ken. He knocks it out of her hand, but she grabs it again, saying shed rather not be burned alive out there. He tells her to think of someone else for once in her life and to shoot him first. She curses him and he takes back the gun. The sound is growing louder and she holds her ears. He holds her.All at once rain begins to fall. Ken and Angela come out to watch. The rain kills the creature and they rejoice as it dies off.","

Next he is seen removing a knife from a metal box.Jeff and Frankie are sitting on a patio table as Angela joins them. Talk of the heat turns to the question of whether Jeff has seen Bob. He hasnt. He hands over his manuscript to Angela to type. Frankie goes inside. Jeff lights a cigarette and Angela comes out, asking for a light. When he goes over to her, she feels his trembling hand and places it on her chest.  You know you want me,  she says.The whirring sound is heard again by both of them. Frankie comes out and tells them that she saw something landing that made a whining noise. They go out to the hill and see Hanson returning. Frankie questions what Hanson is doing. They see nothing and Jeff again questions Frankie about what she saw. He tells them to wait while he goes to look. They tell him they dont want to wait in the dark and to wait until morning. He says he is tired of Hansons sneaking around and will go ask him what he is up to.Hanson is developing film in his room under a red light when Jeff knocks on the door and calls to him. He refuses to open the door, and Jeff threatens to break it down. Hanson tells him to wait a few minutes, but Jeff kicks in the door. Hanson angrily shuts the door to protect the photographs from being exposed to the light. Jeff questions Hanson about what he is doing and why he was on the hill that night. When he mentions about a landing, Hanson is eager to know what was seen. Jeff confesses that it was his wife who saw it. Hanson tells Jeff that he has been investigating an alien invasion the past week and that this is the source of the heat. Jeff expresses doubt about this. Hanson tells him that he ruined the photos he was developing. They go out on location where Hanson has the cameras set up. He shows Jeff some black cinders which he says were burned by something hotter than anything on this planet. As Jeff goes to see about a dog whining at the fence, Hanson calls Jeff to see what broke through the fence. They look at Bobs burned car. Jeff says they must warn others about this, but Hanson says not yet. He wants time to gather new evidence to prove the aliens exist.At the Inn, an old man orders a beer and takes it to a table where an old woman sits. Angela comes downstairs and is seen by Tinker and Ken, who wants to know where the girl was hiding. She says she will go to work on the typing.Jeff and Hanson come into the Inn. Hanson goes up to his room, and Jeff orders a bottle of beer. Frankie asks what the matter is, but Jeff snaps that nothing is wrong. He says the heat is bothering everybody. Suddenly the bottles of beer begin to burst. Frankie gets cut by the shattering glass, and Jeff goes to get a first aid kit. He looks for it in the room where Angela is. She is told about the bursting bottles. He looks at her with her blouse open and cant resist kissing her. At this moment Frankie enters and sees them kissing.Tinker, now affected by the heat, comes in and attacks Angela. They struggle and he throws her onto the couch and tries to rape her. She jumps up and hits the floor, where he continues his attack until she is able to hit him on the head. Tinker flees just as Ken, Jeff and Frankie come in. Ken puts Angela on the bed and goes to get Dr. Stone. Jeff and Hanson run after Tinker. Jeff struggles with Tinker, telling him to come back with him to the Inn. Tinker hits Jeff with a stick and runs off. Hanson approaches and Jeff tells him that Tinker got the best of him.Tinker runs to his garage and lights a welding torch. Looking through the door to see who is coming, he is horrified by something approaching which gives off a bright light and a tremendous humming sound. Dropping the torch, he runs behind a car. The car falls as the door slowly opens, the light shining from outside. Tinker covers his ears as the noise grows unbearable and screams. When Hanson and Jeff arrive, they see only burnt areas and a tank from which all the energy has been drained by the aliens.Dr. Stone is discussing what happened with Tinker, saying it is unlikely under normal circumstances. Hanson says these circumstances are not normal. Frankie comes in just in time to hear Jeff say that two men have been killed. She wants to know who. Stone tells her that Tinker met with an accident. She asks Jeff who the other man was. He tells her it was Bob. Jeff is getting excited and Hanson tells him to remain calm. He tells Frankie and Stone that Hanson believes aliens are attacking them. Jeff says the temperature is now 108 and the telephones are out. Stone suggests they go to the relay station where they can radio for help. He offers to go. Hanson brings him a two-way radio to keep in touch with them.Stone reports over the radio that the car is overheating. As he gets close to the station, the car stalls and he says he will have to walk the rest of the way. As he is looking at the car engine, he is approached by an alien force which produces the loud droning sound and emits a bright light. Stone screams as it closes in on him. Hanson and the others can only listen in shock.Jeff volunteers to go next, but Hanson convinces him that he is better equipped to deal with them. He gets the car keys and tells them to lock all doors and windows. Angela screams and Jeff runs to comfort her. She says she must have had a dream. The man was attacking her. He comforts her as Frankie looks on. She leaves the room, lost in thought. Jeff comes out and Frankie confronts him about knowing the girl before. He denies it at first, but finally admits he knew her before and that they moved here to get away from her. Frankie asks if he loves her. He admits that it was strictly a physical attraction and that his love is for his wife. He calls Angela a slut and admits that he wanted her.Angela comes out and wants the doctor. Jeff tells her the doctor cant come. She insists that she needs him. Finally under duress Frankie tells her the doctor is dead. Angela seems distraught.Hanson arrives at Stones car and finds the battery drained. He finds the radio and calls Jeff to report that Stone is dead, burnt up. He also sees a glowing light in the stone quarry and is going in. Jeff tells him to be careful.Hanson sees Stella and her dog searching with a flashlight. He thinks to warn her, but suddenly she and the dog cry out and flames are seen. Hanson retreats to the car, dropping his flashlight, which goes out. At that moment he realizes the aliens are attracted to the light. He calls Jeff and tells him to put out all the lights at the Inn. He says he will drive to the station with no lights on.At the station we see the radar operator (Barry Halliday) as he notices disturbances on the radar screen. He goes to call someone on the phone and the screen explodes. [This scene was also shown at the beginning of the film, just before the titles.] The electrical circuits crackle and pop. The droning sound becomes very loud and the aliens light reflects on the face of the screaming radar operator.Jeff, Frankie and Angela get restless and decide to drive to the station in Angelas car. Meanwhile, Gerald Foster (Percy Herbert), Hanson and Ken are viewing the burned out control room at the station. Ken says the radar operator was burned to a crisp. Hanson tells them that the aliens were attracted to us through the signals we send into space. Needing an energy source, they were drawn here in energy waves and materialized like a television image. Ken says we must destroy them before they destroy us. They go to get some explosives near the quarry.Jeff says the car is about to fail. Suddenly they run off into a ditch. Angela runs into the road and lies down just as Ken drives up. Jeff comes and they stand Angela to her feet. Ken tells them the radar operator was burnt up. He helps them get the car out of the ditch.At the station Ken says he and Gerald will set the dynamite. Jeff questions using the dynamite, which will light the area and attract the aliens. Hanson argues that there are no other ideas. He tells them to watch for his signal flare gun.Jeff tells Ken to look after Angela if things turn bad so he can stay with Frankie. At that time the flare is shot and seen. They advance to the quarry, where Hanson is setting fires with his flare gun. More flares are shot into the sky by Ken and Jeff. All at once Gerald, who has been throwing dynamite at the creature (who is now visible as a glowing glob) gets stuck and cant get out from where he is. Hanson shouts for Gerald to get away, but he is unable. Dynamite blasts go off near the creature. Angela runs down toward the fires with Ken following her. He catches her and tells her to come back with him. She tries to get away, but he persuades her to follow him to a stone building outside the edge of the quarry. Inside, she tells him not to tell her what to do. She curses him but he tries to reassure her that they should not give up hope. As he looks out the window at the explosions, she eyes the gun in his pocket.As lightning and thunder are heard, Jeff shoots more flares and tells Frankie to stay close. Hanson runs up and warns about the storm. Suddenly the creature is seen coming toward Hanson. Jeff shouts for Hanson to run, but he is overcome by the creature. 
Inside, Angela grabs the gun and turns it on Ken. He knocks it out of her hand, but she grabs it again, saying shed rather not be burned alive out there. He tells her to think of someone else for once in her life and to shoot him first. She curses him and he takes back the gun. The sound is growing louder and she holds her ears. He holds her.All at once rain begins to fall. Ken and Angela come out to watch. The rain kills the creature and they rejoice as it dies off.

"71","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062377/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","September 1942, northern Africa. The German Afrika Korps is some ninety miles from the Suez Canal, and the British have been bombing Marshall Erwin Rommel's supply lines and his supply bases in Tobruk in Libya to little effect. But hundreds of miles east in an Algerian port, Vichy French are holding varied soldiers of the warring nations as prisoner aboard a ship - among the soldiers so imprisoned is Canadian Army Major Donald Craig, an expert in the topography of the Egyptian theater who'd been captured by the French after escaping the Germans across the Sahara.The ship is boarded by German-speaking commandos, who shoot several guards, set fire to the ship, and open the holding cell to take Craig. Craig tries to escape but is knocked unconscious and taken by motorboat to a seaplane. When interrogated by Captain Bergman, the commando leader, Craig grabs a gun and tries to hijack the plane, but is shocked when it is being escorted by a Royal Air Force fighter, a lend-lease P-40 Warhawk of Number 112 Squadron. Captain Bergman then identifies his unit as the Special Identification Group - German-born Jews serving under the British. The seaplane lands in Kufra, a desert strip 800 miles southwest of Tobruk, and Craig and Bergman are greeted by Lieutenant Boydon, assistant to Colonel Harker, commander of the Long Range Desert Group, a commando unit. Harker explains to Craig that Staff in Cairo has decided to adopt a plan first submitted by Craig to infiltrate commandos to blow up Rommel's fuel base in Tobruk; Craig's original plan was submitted when German forces were weaker than they are now, but Harker and his men are tasked with driving through the 800-mile section of the Sahara - in a mere eight days - disguised as POWs under guard of Bergman's SIG masquerading as regular Nazi soldiers. Craig's responsibility is to guide the commando unit through territory only Craig is familiar with; once in Tobruk the commandos are to reach Tobruk harbor where they are to destroy antiship batteries at a cove guarding the harbor and guide a landing of soldiers from sea to blow up the German fuel base and then evacuate to ships. Craig is immediately skeptical of the plan, but has no alternative but to participate. Craig then gets his first encounter with the antisemitic attitude of Harker when the colonel remarks to be on guard around the Jews as they can't be trusted, citing his six years experience in Palestine as evidence. Bergman and his men for their part aren't any more trusting of the British army; in a private conversation Bergman and three of his most trusted men, Lt. Max Mohnfeld, Sgt. Krug, and Corporal Bruckner (whom Bergman has known for ten years), agree they will be thrown to the wolves as the Italians have been similarly sacrificed by their German ""allies."" The column of half-tracks and lorries starts on its 800-mile trek; after a full day the unit stops to rest in a valley, but several miles away a column of Italian tanks is spotted and inconveniently sets up camp nearly a mile away. Later that night a German unit appears from the other side. Bergman and two commandos sneak into the Italian camp and silently kill two sentries, then flee to their side as Harker sets up mortars and opens fire on both the German and Italian units, thus tricking them into opening fire on each other.The next day Craig diverts the column away from nearby flats and instead cuts through an area known to be a German minefield, to the surprise and anger of Harker. At the precipice of the minefield Craig spots two mines and painstakingly clears sand away to make them visible; he then orders Bergman to fire on both. The result is detonation of two lines of mines and thus opening of a safe passage. A night later he strikes up conversation with Bergman as the Captain is adjusting the engine of a half-track. The conversation segues into a bitter comment by Bergman about Nazi slave-labor and Craig somewhat defensively notes ""We all know what's going on in Europe."" Bergman for his part notes that, as a Jew, his war won't be done when the present one eventually is - he and his people will eventually return to Israel.Days later the commando column is attacked by a P40 from Number 112 Squadron, the pilot unaware who the column actually belongs to. The column is forced to fight back and the P40 is shot down, but eight men are killed and a lorry with the column's extra fuel is blasted. The commandos are forced to bury the dead and bury the burning lorry, and the ruckus draws out Libyan tribesmen, Taureg, who think it is a German unit and have offered to return two prisoners in exchange for guns. Harker and company have no choice but to agree, and are surprised to find the prisoners are British traitors, Henry Portman and his daughter Cheryl. To Captain Bergman (whom they think is a Nazi officer transporting British POWs) they reveal they are delivering a document of agreement to Cairo, signed by Field Marshall Kesselring and also the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, the violently antisemitic leader of the Muslim world. The document stipulates that anti-royalist officers in the Egyptian army will launch a ""holy war"" to overthrow the British and thus draw the rest of the Muslim world to the Axis powers, Cheryl Portman pointedly noting Turkey can deploy a four million man army against Soviet Russia. The Portmans request transport to the outskirts of Cairo where they are to meet resident agents and thus deliver the Kesselring document. Bergman informs them that their radio was destroyed and they can only transport them to Tobruk, their nearest base, and from there they can transport the two traitors to their rendezvous.Bergman offers to execute the Portmans and thus not blow their cover, but Harker vetoes such a plan, intending to use the Portmans as a guarantee of entry into Tobruk. His increasingly condescending commentary to Bergman increasingly irritates Craig; a night before they are to reach Tobruk the column sets up camp in an abandoned town. Harker leads a final planning session for the raid where he notes a large transmitter is in the center of the city; if the raid must be aborted he intends to seize the transmitter to radio British forces. He further insults Bergman by condescendingly noting how he and his men volunteered for the mission. Craig then confronts Bergman for not defending himself in front of Harker; Bergman calmly replies that for all Harker's ""old school attitudes"" both sides will be there when they need each other.But that night a man sneaks into the room where Henry Portman is sleeping via underground tunnel and puts a gun to his head, telling him the column is a British commando unit, and that Portman and his daughter must leave the camp via the underground tunnel, go to a marker of stones a mile away that denotes presence of underground telephone cables, and fit a field phone to communicate with Tobruk, which will dispatch armored units to the campsite; the unseen traitor can't do it himself as he can't risk leaving the camp.The scared Portmans, with the field phone and a gun, find the cables, but are shot down by an Italian patrol. Bergman and his men, pretending to be Nazi soldiers, get the information they want from the Italian captain, then take the badly injured Cheryl back to the camp. With the girl in bed with a plasma tube, Colonel Harker orders Bergman's men to unload their weapons; the Captain refuses, so Harker has his men disarm the SIG soldiers. Cheryl is then killed via cyanide, and Lieutenant Mohnfeld (who'd been the first to see the Portmans had escaped) reveals that he spotted the traitor in the underground tunnel and when the two confronted each other he succeeded in knifing the man to death - Bergman, Craig, and Harker find it to be Corporal Bruckner, to Bergman's disbelief even with Bruckner's cyanide tablet gone.On the morning the commandos are to drive into Tobruk Craig confronts Harker, clearly fearful the raid will fail and tired of Harker's bigotry, but Harker will have none of it. The column enters Tobruk and passes through, passing the transmitter they may need to seize. It then passes a marshalling area where two German tank divisions have arrived undetected by British intelligence, making an amphibious landing impossible but with the fuel base - assembled via mammoth underground tanks, thus explaining their immunity to air attack - still a viable target. The column reaches the antiship batteries overlooking the harbor and Harker sends Lt. Boydon and Mohnfeld to get to the radio transmitter, just as RAF bombing begins. Boydon and Mohnfeld's half-track is hit by bombs and the radio tower smashed. Upon seeing Allied battleships begin firing on the shore for the landing, Harker has Sergeant Major Tyne use an orders lamp to send morse code to the ships to abort the landing. The commandos infiltrate the main shore guns as they open fire on the landing and succeed in blowing up one battery, while Tyne succeeds in turning the landing around - just as Rommel's tank reserves arrive to counterattack against the landing. A massive firefight erupts and the commandos are trapped on the beach, but Bergman and three others escape via motorcycles, while Krug and the two remaining SIG soldiers stay with Craig. Bergman and his men sneak back to the beach and with flamethrower and satchel charges blast several tanks and a number of German infantrymen, thus allowing Harker to evacuate his men from the beach. Craig, however, leads the three SIG soldiers further inland, where they spot a tank on overwatch and realize they can use it for a desperate final attack on the underground fuel base.","

The officer, Donald Craig, must negotiate a company of British and German-Jewish commandos through 800 miles of the Sahara to aide a pending amphibious landing against Tobruk's massive fuel storage base - a mission that sees one impediment after another, and which discovers an undetected German armored force ready to win the battle of Egypt.

They are heading home to their families, stealing food at the markets, getting drunk, and hassling young ladies along the way. As more and more students reach their homes, the only ones left traveling are Khoma Brut [Leonid Kuravlev] and his two friends, Khaliava [Vadim Zakharchenko] and Gorobetz [Vladimir Salnikov]. As evening approaches, it becomes foggy and the road has disappeared, so they start looking for a place where they can spend the night and get a glass of vodka. Just when it looks like they're going to be forced to spend the night under the stars, they come to a house. An old woman [ Nikolai Kutuzov] answers their knocks on the gate. At first, she refuses to put them up for the night, but she finally relents. One gets to sleep in the house, another in the loft, and Khoma gets stuck with a haypile near the pigpen. During the night, Khoma is awakened by the old lady's advances on him. She chases him around the barn until she catches him, jumps on his back, grabs her broom, and the two of them go flying. Khoma realizes that the old hag is a witch. By invoking the name of Christ, he brings her back to earth. He finds a stick and beats her royally until she suddenly turns into a beautiful young girl. Leaving the girl lying on the ground, Khoma runs all the way back to the Monastery.No sooner does Khoma return but the Rector [Pyotr Vesklyarov] summons him. The Rector informs Khoma that he has been contacted by a famous Sotnik [Aleksei Glazyrin] living near Kiev. The Sotnik's daughter Pannochka [Natalya Varley] is dying from a beating she received the other day, and her dying request was that Khoma Brut be the one to say the last prayers for her salvation. Khoma refuses the job, but the Rector gives him no choice. Either say the prayers or receive lashings in front of the entire seminary. Against his will, Khoma goes along with the servants sent by the Sotnik to fetch him. It's a long drive in a horse-drawn wagon, and Khoma tries to get away several times. Each time he is prevented from leaving by the servants. Yet, when he asks the servants why the girl needs to have such solemn prayers said for the deliverance of her soul, they are strangely silent.When Khoma gets to the Solnik's house, he learns that Pannochka, has requested that he, Khoma Brut, say prayers over her for three nights in a row. Kohma is roundly questioned by the dead girl's father about his chastity, but Khoma denies ever knowing her that way. The vigil is set to start that night. Pannochka's body is moved into the church, and Khoma is served dinner, during which the villagers tell stories about how Pannochka has bewitched men in the past. Later that evening, Khoma is locked in the church where Pannochka's body is lying in state. He lights candles to chase away the gloom, sets up a pedestal, and begins to pray. Feeling pretty chipper at his praying ability, he sniffs a little tobacco. Unfortunately, his sniffs awaken Pannochka's corpse. She sits up in her coffin and wafts down to the floor. Now knowing that Pannochka is indeed a witch, Khoma draws a circle around his pedestal. For the rest of the night, until cockcrow, Khoma prays as Pannochka searches the room and circles the pedestal looking for a way to get to him.The next day, Khoma eats his borscht and, when asked how the night went, he admits only to hearing some noises. Calling himself a Cossack, he convinces himself that Cossacks have no fear. When night comes, armed with a bit of vodka, Khoma bravely agrees to be holed up in the church for his second night. He again draws a circle and begins his prayers. Pannochka awakens and, for the rest of the night, she circles the room, riding in her coffin, looking for Khoma and calling out his name. At cockcrow, she again returns to her coffin.Day three. Khoma emerges from the church, dancing and singing mindlessly until he takes off his hat and the villagers notice that his hair has turned white. Khoma pleads with the Solnik to let him return home, but the Solnik offers him a thousand pieces of gold or a thousand lashes. Once more, Khoma tries to escape the village, but he is met by two Cossacks who stop him. Armed with several flasks of vodka, Khoma enters the church for night three. Once again, Khoma draws his circle and begins his prayers. This night, however, Pannochka summons demons from hell. They rise from the floors, crawl out of the walls, and drop from the ceilings. Then, Pannochka summons the big demon, Viy. Viy points his finger at Khoma and directs all the other demons to get him. The demons penetrate the circle and jump on Khoma.When the villagers open the church doors at sunrise, they find Khoma dead. Back at the Seminary, Khoma's friends Khaliava and Gorobetz discuss Khoma's desmise. Their conclusion: Khoma didn't have enough faith in God. Or maybe he had too much vodka.

Khoma refuses the job, but the Rector gives him no choice. Either say the prayers or receive lashings in front of the entire seminary. Against his will, Khoma goes along with the servants sent by the Sotnik to fetch him. It's a long drive in a horse-drawn wagon, and Khoma tries to get away several times. Each time he is prevented from leaving by the servants. Yet, when he asks the servants why the girl needs to have such solemn prayers said for the deliverance of her soul, they are strangely silent.When Khoma gets to the Solnik's house, he learns that Pannochka, has requested that he, Khoma Brut, say prayers over her for three nights in a row. Kohma is roundly questioned by the dead girl's father about his chastity, but Khoma denies ever knowing her that way. The vigil is set to start that night. Pannochka's body is moved into the church, and Khoma is served dinner, during which the villagers tell stories about how Pannochka has bewitched men in the past. Later that evening, Khoma is locked in the church where Pannochka's body is lying in state. He lights candles to chase away the gloom, sets up a pedestal, and begins to pray. Feeling pretty chipper at his praying ability, he sniffs a little tobacco. Unfortunately, his sniffs awaken Pannochka's corpse. She sits up in her coffin and wafts down to the floor. Now knowing that Pannochka is indeed a witch, Khoma draws a circle around his pedestal. For the rest of the night, until cockcrow, Khoma prays as Pannochka searches the room and circles the pedestal looking for a way to get to him.The next day, Khoma eats his borscht and, when asked how the night went, he admits only to hearing some noises. Calling himself a Cossack, he convinces himself that Cossacks have no fear. When night comes, armed with a bit of vodka, Khoma bravely agrees to be holed up in the church for his second night. He again draws a circle and begins his prayers. Pannochka awakens and, for the rest of the night, she circles the room, riding in her coffin, looking for Khoma and calling out his name. At cockcrow, she again returns to her coffin.Day three. Khoma emerges from the church, dancing and singing mindlessly until he takes off his hat and the villagers notice that his hair has turned white. Khoma pleads with the Solnik to let him return home, but the Solnik offers him a thousand pieces of gold or a thousand lashes. Once more, Khoma tries to escape the village, but he is met by two Cossacks who stop him. Armed with several flasks of vodka, Khoma enters the church for night three. Once again, Khoma draws his circle and begins his prayers. This night, however, Pannochka summons demons from hell. They rise from the floors, crawl out of the walls, and drop from the ceilings. Then, Pannochka summons the big demon, Viy. Viy points his finger at Khoma and directs all the other demons to get him. The demons penetrate the circle and jump on Khoma.When the villagers open the church doors at sunrise, they find Khoma dead. Back at the Seminary, Khoma's friends Khaliava and Gorobetz discuss Khoma's desmise. Their conclusion: Khoma didn't have enough faith in God. Or maybe he had too much vodka.

                    Sylvia Barrett is a rookie teacher at New York's inner-city Calvin Coolidge High: her lit classes are overcrowded, a window is broken, there's no chalk, books arrive late. The administration is concerned mainly with forms and rules (there's an up and a down staircase); bells ring at the wrong time. Nevertheless, she tries. How she handles the chaos and her despair in her first semester makes up the film: a promising student drops out, another sleeps through class, a girl with a crush on a male teacher gets suicidal, and a bright but troublesome student misunderstands Sylvia's reaching out. A discussion of Dickens, parents' night, and a mock trial highlight the term. Can she make it?

                    Fresh out of graduate school, Sylvia Barrett begins her teaching career as an English Literature teacher at Calvin Coolidge High School, located in a tough inner city neighborhood in New York City. The school is overly bureaucratic and disorganized, with forms needing to be completed for every small task (why would an English teacher be required to fill out a basketball requisition form?), keys allocated to teachers even for things that do not exist, lack of supplies or people to fix broken items, overcrowded classrooms, and staircases labeled as up and down. This bureaucracy is designed to deal with the chaos that exists both within the staff and student body. Despite these problems, Miss Barrett comes into the school with an idealistic view of being able to assist students in learning, regardless of obvious or hidden obstacles. Some of the students who may be facing some of these obstacles are moody but bright Joe Ferone who is always on the verge of expulsion, romantic but socially awkward Alice Blake, and Roy Hackett, whose surrogate mother pleads on his behalf for Miss Barrett to pass Roy despite him continually falling asleep in class. Miss Barrett's fellow English teacher, Paul Barringer, who is the center of attention of many a female student and who has aspirations of getting out of teaching to become a novelist, tries to advise Miss Barrett not to take her job so seriously. Through it all, will the school get the better of Miss Barrett or will she get the better of the school and the students?

                    There is an on-going battle of industrial espionage between rival cosmetics companies, Femina, owned by Sir Jason Fox, and May Fortune, owned by Matthew Cutter. Caught in the middle between the two are among others top industrial designer Patricia Foster, who officially is on May Fortune's payroll after being fired by Femina, and Christopher White, a suave Brit who also is officially on May Fortune's payroll as Cutter's right hand man. On the surface, Patricia is still working for Femina trying to steal the new top secret formula for a water repellent hairspray developed by Dr. Stuart Clancy for May Fortune, that hairspray which would make all other hairsprays obsolete, while Christopher secretly tries to stop her. Below the surface, it is not clear whether either Patricia or Christopher truly are working for May Fortune, Femina or someone else. But as they progress through these on the surface missions, their true missions are eventually revealed as are their true allegiances, which place both Patricia and Christopher in mortal danger with regard to a recent story of an Interpol agent being killed in the Swiss Alps.

                    Evangelical Violet Hook, ill and largely bedridden, has hired Mrs. Quayle as a part-time housekeeper, her duties including looking after the seven Hook children, Elsa, Diana, Hubert, Dunstan, Jiminee, Gerty and Willy, who range in age from young teen to young adolescent. Despite her illness, Violet has not used the services of a physician, she suspect of anyone of authority. When Violet dies in bed at home, the children decide not to tell anyone, fearing the consequences of the unknown if they do. They bury their mother in their backyard, continue with their dedicated ""mother time"" by setting up a shrine in their backyard tabernacle (which in reality is a shed) with Diana claiming that she can ""speak"" to their mother, and live off her annuity checks with artistically inclined Jiminee able to forge her signature, while they hope to keep her savings for a rainy day as she had intended. On a day-to-day basis, they have differing views on what to do, with Elsa being overwhelmed by the responsibility of being the oldest, Hugh being the nurturing one, Dunstan the fire and brimstone evangelical, and the three youngest largely oblivious to the severity of their situation, especially Gerty, the overly trusting one. All they all know is that they have to keep adults out of the house, especially the likes of opportunistic Mrs. Quayle and their teacher, Miss Bailey. Things change for them with the arrival back into their lives of Charlie Hook, Violet's long gone husband who only Elsa knew existed as a live person before their mother's death. The children's view of Charlie in their lives is as diverse as their personalities. Over time, they will figure out if having Charlie in their lives is to their benefit, and if not what they have to do for a sustainable long term future for them as a collective.
