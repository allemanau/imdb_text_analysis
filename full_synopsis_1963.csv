The narrator, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) tells us, ""An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House. Whatever walked there walked alone."" Title and credits follow, then narration continues, ""Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide: The history of Hill House was ideal. It had everything I wanted..."" The house was built in New England by a man named Hugh Crain for his wife and young daughter. A horse and carriage accident took the life of the first Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Pamela Buckley) before she even saw the house. Hugh Crain (an uncredited Howard Lang) and young daughter, Abigail (an uncredited Janet Mansell) said a few words over the body, but Hugh was left an embittered man. Crain married again, and the second Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Freda Knorr) also died, falling down the main staircase. Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse (an uncredited Susan Richards) and went to England where he died in a drowning accident. Abigail kept the same nursery room her entire life. By the time she was eighty (an uncredited Amy Dalby) she was a bedridden invalid. Her nurse-companion (an uncredited Rosemary Dorken) was a local girl and, it is with this young companion the evil reputation of Hill House really begins. The old lady died while calling for help. The companion was trysting on the verandah with a farm hand. The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years, but eventually hanged herself. The house then passed to a distant relative, named Mrs. Sanderson (Fay Compton). Markway visits Mrs. Sanderson where he convinces her to let him use the house for psychic research. He explains, ""I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...I must have specially qualified help to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find."" Eldridge Harper (Ronald Adam), Mrs. Sanderson's lawyer, voices his concern about publicity seekers and the propriety of having women in the house. Harper suggests to Mrs. Sanderson that her nephew, Luke, joins the doctor at Hill House, as he expects to inherit the property. Mrs. Sanderson asks point blank, ""Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?"" Markway replies, ""Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe, I only say maybe, the key to another world.""Dr. Markway, taking a leave of absence from his university professorship, finalizes his list of assistants. Only two end up accepting, Eleanor Lance and Theodora (no last name). Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is living with her sister. She is nearly broke and weary after looking after her invalid mother non-stop for eleven years. Mother is now dead, and she fights with her sister over just about everything. She begs to use the car, which is after all, half hers. Her brother-in-law, Bud Fredericks (an uncredited Paul Maxwell) tries to act as mediator between Eleanor and his wife, Carrie (Diane Clare). He is sympathetic to Eleanor's plight, but their daughter, Dora (an uncredited Verina Greenlaw) takes her cues from her mother, and taunts her Aunt Eleanor. On the vacation plan, Bud sides with Eleanor, ""I think you should have a vacation, Nell."" Carrie objects, but Eleanor is not to be deterred and she shows her family how she reacts when pushed to her breaking point. She is normally quiet and meek, but when pushed is loud and assertive. Nell decides to take the car and confronts the garage attendant (an uncredited Claude Jones) for the keys. She departs Boston along U.S. 50 and Route 238 to Hill House. We hear Nell thinking and she reveals she will never return to live with her sister. In fact, most of what we learn of Eleanor is hearing her thoughts.Eleanor arrives at Hill House. The property is surrounded by a stone wall and the entrance by a tall, iron spiked, gate. She honks the car horn, and Mr. Dudley (Valentine Dyall), the cranky caretaker, finally deigns to respond. ""What do you want?"" he asks. Eleanor explains that she is expected. After an impertinent exchange with Eleanor, Dudley finally opens the gate and allows her to enter the property. Eleanor is the first to arrive and drives up to the house. Along the way she stops to look at it. It is a huge, stone mansion with lots of detail on the façade and steep, pitched roofs. Her first reaction is that the house is vile and it is staring at her. She carries her suitcase to the front door and is greeted by Mrs. Dudley (Rosalie Crutchley). Mrs. Dudley reluctantly allows Eleanor to come inside, but does not utter a word to her. The inside of the house is dark and over-decorated, and Eleanor is escorted to her room. Mrs. Dudley explains the house rules about meals, and that she won't stay in the house after dark. Eleanor checks out the bathroom and hears the next guest arrive. Theodora (Claire Bloom) introduces herself. Eleanor explains they share a bathroom. Mrs. Dudley repeats her meal and departure rules by rote, but Theo and Nell ignore her. Theodora is a bit strange to Eleanor (Theo clearly flirts with Eleanor throughout the film) Theodora's sexual orientation is only hinted at, and we later learn she has the gift of ESP. Theo and Nell explore the house, but they get lost. Both women feel a chill, and Nell observes, ""The house, it's alive."" Theo seems to feel that the house wants Nell. Dr. Markway appears and explains he left the door opened, but it closed itself. Markway gives the women a tour of part of the house, starting with the main purple parlor, which they will use as an operations center. He explains that all the doors were set slightly off-center, so they close themselves. Despite studying plans to the house, even Markway gets lost on his way to the dining room. They hear a noise, but it turns out to be Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) mixing a pitcher of martinis as he enters the dining room. Luke serves each person a martini. They sit down for dinner and discuss their duties and responsibilities. Markway explains that Theo was accepted because of her remarkable power of ESP and Eleanor had a poltergeist experience as a child, ""showers of stone fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old."" Luke is a non-believer. His interest is to financially exploit Hill House, after he inherits it, of course.That evening, in the parlor, Markway works on his notes while Eleanor sits quietly on the couch. Theo and Luke play gin rummy at the game table. Theo's ability to see cards allows her to win five games in a row, much to Luke annoyance. She demands he pay her the $12 he owes, but he refuses because she cheated. The four decide to turn in for the night and continue the tour the next morning. Markway gives them papers and asks that they complete them with their observations each night.Sometime during the night, Eleanor wakes, and still in a near dream state, thinks she hears her mother knocking on the wall. Theo hears it from the next room also and calls to Nell. The two women are frightened and both hear the pounding noise. It comes and goes, but louder each time. They finally hear a woman shrieking and laughing that fades away. When Nell opens the door she sees Luke and Markway in the hall outside. The men explain they were chasing a dog and followed it outside, but they did not hear the loud noises the women heard. Markway concludes that something is trying to separate the men and women.The next morning, Markway and Nell join for breakfast. Nell is starting to develop romantic feelings for John Markway, unaware that he is married. She tells him that she spent eleven years taking care of her invalid mother. Nell also voices her fear that she will be turned out of Hill House with no where to go. Markway tells Nell how he came to do psychic research, and that his family disapproves. Theo joins the pair and warns the doctor, ""If anyone gets hurt, it's going to be your fault, Markway."" Markway explains that no one has ever been physically hurt by a ghost. Luke enters and directs his companions to something he saw in the hall. Someone or something has handwritten a message in chalk on the wall. It says, ""Help Eleanor Come Home."" Eleanor reacts strongly. She first accuses Theo of playing a cruel joke. The two women bicker and Markway postpones the tour and tells Theo to take Eleanor to her room.The tour starts with the greenhouse. A large stone sculpture sits in the center of the room. It is supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers, but Luke thinks its a family portrait of Hugh Crain and his wives and daughter. Suddenly, the door slams open and a gust of wind moves the plants. They approach the library, but Nell refuses to enter. The smell reminds her of her mother's sick room. Prominent in the room is a very tall, wrought iron, spiral staircase. Markway points out that the balcony high above is where the companion to Abigail Crain hanged herself. Luke climbs up a few feet on the staircase, but jumps back to the ground when it starts to sway and shake. Eleanor ventures out to the verandah and nearly falls over the balcony as she looks up to the tower above the library. Markway threatens to send her home, but Nell begs to stay. Markway suggests Theo and Nell share a bedroom... ""like sisters"". That evening, the two women discuss their lives and plans for the future. Nell makes up a story about having an apartment of her own. Just when Theo is about to make a move onto Nell, Markway calls them and Luke into the hallway outside the Nursery. He has discovered a cold spot. He invites all to experience the phenomenon. He gleefully explains, ""A cold spot, a genuine cold spot. I guarantee it won't register on any thermometer."" Luke dismisses it as just a draft, but Markway says it is the heart of Hill House: The Nursery.In the middle of the night, Nell awakens. She hears a little girl laughing. She asks Theo to hold her hand, as their two beds are almost touching. The laughter continues and Nell complains, ""Theo, you're breaking my hand."" The laughs turn to wimpering and Nell complains that something is hurting a child and she won't allow that to happen. She yells, ""Stop It!"" Theo turns on the light and we see Nell is on a day bed about twenty feet from the bed Theo occupies. Nell stares at her hand and asks, ""Whose hand was I holding?"" The next morning, Markway is in the music room and checks his watch and makes a note about the harp playing itself. Nell enters the room and asks about how it could play itself. Markway explains that it may be preternatural: Something we don't have any natural explanation for right now, but probably will have some day. Nell voices her fear that it is all in her imagination and concludes she may be going insane. She is haunted by the circumstances of her mother's death and that she may somehow be responsible. They both hear the harp play a note and Markway again checks his watch and makes a note in his paperwork.That evening, Luke finds a disturbing book that Hugh Crain made for his daughter, Abigail. Nell and Theo bicker and Markway notes that everyone's nerves are on edge. Theo continues to flirt as well as needle Nell, this time about a budding romance she fantasizes about with John Markway. Nell runs away and Theo catches up to her, and tells Nell that is he is making a fool of herself in thinking that Dr. Markway will ever get involved with her. Nell accuses Theo of being an ""unnatural thing"" as well as a ""nature's mistake."" At that moment, a car horn honks and a taxi pulls up in front of the house. Grace Markway (Lois Maxwell), John's wife, arrives. She informs her husband, ""A reporter's been telephoning all day. He's on your track. He's heard about you renting this place."" Grace begs her husband to abandon the house and his research. When John refuses, Grace pays the driver, grabs her suitcase and announces she is staying at Hill House, ""to join the ghost hunt."" When Eleanor casually mentions the nursery as a place to stay, Grace quickly accepts the challenge, ""Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is."" Markway and Nell try to dissuade her, but Grace responds, ""You insult my intelligence. You don't think I'd believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me."" Luke notices the door to the nursery is open for the first time. Grace decides to spend the night in the room, despite everyone's warning not to. Markway insists he and the three researchers spend the night downstairs in the parlor.Later that night, Nell and Theo sleep together on the sofa by the fireplace as Markway sleeps in a chair. Luke finishes his tour upstairs and enters the parlor. He heads for a bottle on the mantle. Suddenly, the parlor door slams shut by itself and the others wake with a start. They hear a deep rhythmic banging outside the door. Markway is concerned about his wife upstairs. Next a very loud banging comes from just outside the door. The unseen phantom presses against the parlor door as it bows inward and out like breathing, creaking and crunching against the hinges. The sound moves to overhead towards the nursery. Markway is desperate to check on his wife. Unseen, Nell runs from the parlor, through the music room, and upstairs directly to the nursery room. The doors are open, but Grace Markway is nowhere to be seen. Her bed shows signs of being used. Markway and the others arrive and start the search. Nell wanders away. She finds herself in the greenhouse. Descending into her own little world, Nell dances out onto the verandah. When she hears the others calling to her, Nell runs into the Library. She is drawn to the spiral staircase and the balcony at the top. Before she reaches the top, the rickety staircase begins its swaying, the lateral support bolts pulling away from the wall. Markway calls to her, begging her to carefully walk back down. She ignores him and stands on the balcony. Markway carefully climbs the stairs and joins Nell on the iron balcony platform. Before they walk back down, Nell sees Grace Markway peer at her through a trap door in the ceiling.A little later, Markway is furious and now insists Eleanor leave the house for her own safety. Luke brings her car around and Theo packs her bag. Nell tries to talk them out of her dismissal, but the three insist she leave. They escort Eleanor out to her car. Luke gets back out of Nell's car to retrieve the gate key from Markway. She drives off without Luke. Before she reaches the gate she is distracted by the white-robed figure of Grace Markway and crashes into a tree. The three find Eleanor dead in the half overturned car. She crashed into the same tree that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Grace wanders over to the accident scene. She explains to her husband, ""I didn't want any of this to happen. You must believe me, John."" She explains that she woke and was frightened. She got lost looking for her husband and ended up in the attic. While Theo blames Grace for Eleanor's accident, Luke takes a different view. ""Eleanor did it to herself. It looked to me, anyway, like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree."" Markway blames the house. Luke stares at the house and remarks, ""It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt."" We close with an evening shot of Hill House with Eleanor, now a ghost, narrating from beyond the grave about Hill House and that ""we who walk here... walk alone."" The end title comes up as well as the final title card 'The Haunting' followed by eerie piano music.","
    
                    Dr. Markway, doing research to prove the existence of ghosts, investigates Hill House, a large, eerie mansion with a lurid history of violent death and insanity. With him are the skeptical young Luke, who stands to inherit the house, the mysterious and clairvoyant Theodora and the insecure Eleanor, whose psychic abilities make her feel somehow attuned to whatever spirits inhabit the old mansion. As time goes by it becomes obvious that they have gotten more than they bargained for as the ghostly presence in the house manifests itself in horrific and deadly ways.

                    Located in a remote part of New England and isolated from any nearby community, Hill House is a 90-year-old, 19th century mansion with a long history of death and murder. When Dr. John Markway gets a chance to stay there for a few weeks, he sees an opportunity to study what is reportedly a genuine haunted house. With several others including Luke Sanderson, Eleanor 'Nell' Lance and a one-named woman named Theodora, they prepare to launch their experiments. Theo is there because of her ESP skills while Nell had a previous experience with a poltergeist and Luke represents the family that still owns Hill House. Soon after their arrival, the temporary occupants begin to face terrifying ordeals. Nell, who has lived a sheltered and repressed life having spent all of her time caring for her recently deceased mother, is clearly the focus of the emanations and the haunting. She is both terrified and comforted in Hill House and part of her wants to stay. The spirits seem to want to keep her as well.

                    Anthropologist Dr. John Markway is interested in the study of the supernatural, much to the chagrin of his wife, Grace Markway. He is able to convince Mrs. Sanderson, the current owner of isolated Hill House, to let him bring a research team into the house to search for supernatural phenomena. In its ninety year history, Hill House, located in remote New England, has been the location of many a violent and mysterious death of its inhabitants, Mrs. Sanderson being a distant relative of the original family owners, the Crains. Mrs. Sanderson, who doesn't live at the house believing it to be haunted, has one stipulation: that her Midwestern nephew Luke Sanderson, the spoiled and immature supposed heir of the house, be part of that research team. The other two members of the team, who Dr. Markway has not yet met but hired solely based one issue he knows about each, are surname-less Theodora - ""Theo"" - and Eleanor Lance - ""Nell"" - the former a somewhat glib psychic, the latter who grew up with some supernatural phenomena which she would rather forget. Eleanor is a meek and nervous woman who has felt trapped in most of her adult life, having to take care of her invalid mother until her passing two months ago about which she feels some guilt in its occurrence. Currently living with her married sister, Eleanor sees this research as a vacation, realistically an escape from her current sad life. As the research progresses, the four members truly begin to believe that there is something supernatural about their environment. But Eleanor begins to feel connected to the house, and what is happening in it... or is she just justifying it as a better replacement for her current life?

    Synopsis
    The film opens with narration over a silhouette of Hill House at night. The narrator, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) tells us, ""An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House. Whatever walked there walked alone."" Title and credits follow, then narration continues, ""Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide: The history of Hill House was ideal. It had everything I wanted..."" The house was built in New England by a man named Hugh Crain for his wife and young daughter. A horse and carriage accident took the life of the first Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Pamela Buckley) before she even saw the house. Hugh Crain (an uncredited Howard Lang) and young daughter, Abigail (an uncredited Janet Mansell) said a few words over the body, but Hugh was left an embittered man. Crain married again, and the second Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Freda Knorr) also died, falling down the main staircase. Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse (an uncredited Susan Richards) and went to England where he died in a drowning accident. Abigail kept the same nursery room her entire life. By the time she was eighty (an uncredited Amy Dalby) she was a bedridden invalid. Her nurse-companion (an uncredited Rosemary Dorken) was a local girl and, it is with this young companion the evil reputation of Hill House really begins. The old lady died while calling for help. The companion was trysting on the verandah with a farm hand. The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years, but eventually hanged herself. The house then passed to a distant relative, named Mrs. Sanderson (Fay Compton). Markway visits Mrs. Sanderson where he convinces her to let him use the house for psychic research. He explains, ""I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...I must have specially qualified help to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find."" Eldridge Harper (Ronald Adam), Mrs. Sanderson's lawyer, voices his concern about publicity seekers and the propriety of having women in the house. Harper suggests to Mrs. Sanderson that her nephew, Luke, joins the doctor at Hill House, as he expects to inherit the property. Mrs. Sanderson asks point blank, ""Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?"" Markway replies, ""Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe, I only say maybe, the key to another world.""Dr. Markway, taking a leave of absence from his university professorship, finalizes his list of assistants. Only two end up accepting, Eleanor Lance and Theodora (no last name). Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is living with her sister. She is nearly broke and weary after looking after her invalid mother non-stop for eleven years. Mother is now dead, and she fights with her sister over just about everything. She begs to use the car, which is after all, half hers. Her brother-in-law, Bud Fredericks (an uncredited Paul Maxwell) tries to act as mediator between Eleanor and his wife, Carrie (Diane Clare). He is sympathetic to Eleanor's plight, but their daughter, Dora (an uncredited Verina Greenlaw) takes her cues from her mother, and taunts her Aunt Eleanor. On the vacation plan, Bud sides with Eleanor, ""I think you should have a vacation, Nell."" Carrie objects, but Eleanor is not to be deterred and she shows her family how she reacts when pushed to her breaking point. She is normally quiet and meek, but when pushed is loud and assertive. Nell decides to take the car and confronts the garage attendant (an uncredited Claude Jones) for the keys. She departs Boston along U.S. 50 and Route 238 to Hill House. We hear Nell thinking and she reveals she will never return to live with her sister. In fact, most of what we learn of Eleanor is hearing her thoughts.Eleanor arrives at Hill House. The property is surrounded by a stone wall and the entrance by a tall, iron spiked, gate. She honks the car horn, and Mr. Dudley (Valentine Dyall), the cranky caretaker, finally deigns to respond. ""What do you want?"" he asks. Eleanor explains that she is expected. After an impertinent exchange with Eleanor, Dudley finally opens the gate and allows her to enter the property. Eleanor is the first to arrive and drives up to the house. Along the way she stops to look at it. It is a huge, stone mansion with lots of detail on the façade and steep, pitched roofs. Her first reaction is that the house is vile and it is staring at her. She carries her suitcase to the front door and is greeted by Mrs. Dudley (Rosalie Crutchley).

They hear a noise, but it turns out to be Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) mixing a pitcher of martinis as he enters the dining room. Luke serves each person a martini. They sit down for dinner and discuss their duties and responsibilities. Markway explains that Theo was accepted because of her remarkable power of ESP and Eleanor had a poltergeist experience as a child, ""showers of stone fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old."" Luke is a non-believer. His interest is to financially exploit Hill House, after he inherits it, of course.That evening, in the parlor, Markway works on his notes while Eleanor sits quietly on the couch.

Nell also voices her fear that she will be turned out of Hill House with no where to go. Markway tells Nell how he came to do psychic research, and that his family disapproves. Theo joins the pair and warns the doctor, ""If anyone gets hurt, it's going to be your fault, Markway."" Markway explains that no one has ever been physically hurt by a ghost. Luke enters and directs his companions to something he saw in the hall. Someone or something has handwritten a message in chalk on the wall. It says, ""Help Eleanor Come Home."" Eleanor reacts strongly. She first accuses Theo of playing a cruel joke. The two women bicker and Markway postpones the tour and tells Theo to take Eleanor to her room.The tour starts with the greenhouse. A large stone sculpture sits in the center of the room. It is supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers, but Luke thinks its a family portrait of Hugh Crain and his wives and daughter. Suddenly, the door slams open and a gust of wind moves the plants. They approach the library, but Nell refuses to enter. The smell reminds her of her mother's sick room. Prominent in the room is a very tall, wrought iron, spiral staircase. Markway points out that the balcony high above is where the companion to Abigail Crain hanged herself. Luke climbs up a few feet on the staircase, but jumps back to the ground when it starts to sway and shake. Eleanor ventures out to the verandah and nearly falls over the balcony as she looks up to the tower above the library. Markway threatens to send her home, but Nell begs to stay. Markway suggests Theo and Nell share a bedroom... ""like sisters"". That evening, the two women discuss their lives and plans for the future.

The laughs turn to wimpering and Nell complains that something is hurting a child and she won't allow that to happen. She yells, ""Stop It!"" Theo turns on the light and we see Nell is on a day bed about twenty feet from the bed Theo occupies. Nell stares at her hand and asks, ""Whose hand was I holding?"" The next morning, Markway is in the music room and checks his watch and makes a note about the harp playing itself. Nell enters the room and asks about how it could play itself. Markway explains that it may be preternatural: Something we don't have any natural explanation for right now, but probably will have some day. Nell voices her fear that it is all in her imagination and concludes she may be going insane. She is haunted by the circumstances of her mother's death and that she may somehow be responsible. They both hear the harp play a note and Markway again checks his watch and makes a note in his paperwork.That evening, Luke finds a disturbing book that Hugh Crain made for his daughter, Abigail. Nell and Theo bicker and Markway notes that everyone's nerves are on edge. Theo continues to flirt as well as needle Nell, this time about a budding romance she fantasizes about with John Markway. Nell runs away and Theo catches up to her, and tells Nell that is he is making a fool of herself in thinking that Dr. Markway will ever get involved with her. Nell accuses Theo of being an ""unnatural thing"" as well as a ""nature's mistake."" At that moment, a car horn honks and a taxi pulls up in front of the house. Grace Markway (Lois Maxwell), John's wife, arrives. She informs her husband, ""A reporter's been telephoning all day. He's on your track. He's heard about you renting this place."" Grace begs her husband to abandon the house and his research. When John refuses, Grace pays the driver, grabs her suitcase and announces she is staying at Hill House, ""to join the ghost hunt."" When Eleanor casually mentions the nursery as a place to stay, Grace quickly accepts the challenge, ""Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is."" Markway and Nell try to dissuade her, but Grace responds, ""You insult my intelligence. You don't think I'd believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me."" Luke notices the door to the nursery is open for the first time. Grace decides to spend the night in the room, despite everyone's warning not to. Markway insists he and the three researchers spend the night downstairs in the parlor.Later that night, Nell and Theo sleep together on the sofa by the fireplace as Markway sleeps in a chair. Luke finishes his tour upstairs and enters the parlor. He heads for a bottle on the mantle. Suddenly, the parlor door slams shut by itself and the others wake with a start. They hear a deep rhythmic banging outside the door. Markway is concerned about his wife upstairs. Next a very loud banging comes from just outside the door. The unseen phantom presses against the parlor door as it bows inward and out like breathing, creaking and crunching against the hinges. The sound moves to overhead towards the nursery. Markway is desperate to check on his wife. Unseen, Nell runs from the parlor, through the music room, and upstairs directly to the nursery room. The doors are open, but Grace Markway is nowhere to be seen. Her bed shows signs of being used. Markway and the others arrive and start the search. Nell wanders away. She finds herself in the greenhouse. Descending into her own little world, Nell dances out onto the verandah. When she hears the others calling to her, Nell runs into the Library. She is drawn to the spiral staircase and the balcony at the top. Before she reaches the top, the rickety staircase begins its swaying, the lateral support bolts pulling away from the wall. Markway calls to her, begging her to carefully walk back down. She ignores him and stands on the balcony. Markway carefully climbs the stairs and joins Nell on the iron balcony platform. Before they walk back down, Nell sees Grace Markway peer at her through a trap door in the ceiling.A little later, Markway is furious and now insists Eleanor leave the house for her own safety. Luke brings her car around and Theo packs her bag. Nell tries to talk them out of her dismissal, but the three insist she leave. They escort Eleanor out to her car. Luke gets back out of Nell's car to retrieve the gate key from Markway. She drives off without Luke. Before she reaches the gate she is distracted by the white-robed figure of Grace Markway and crashes into a tree. The three find Eleanor dead in the half overturned car. She crashed into the same tree that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Grace wanders over to the accident scene. She explains to her husband, ""I didn't want any of this to happen. You must believe me, John."" She explains that she woke and was frightened. She got lost looking for her husband and ended up in the attic. While Theo blames Grace for Eleanor's accident, Luke takes a different view. ""Eleanor did it to herself. It looked to me, anyway, like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree."" Markway blames the house. Luke stares at the house and remarks, ""It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt."" We close with an evening shot of Hill House with Eleanor, now a ghost, narrating from beyond the grave about Hill House and that ""we who walk here... walk alone."" The end title comes up as well as the final title card 'The Haunting' followed by eerie piano music.

As the film opens, Melanie is visiting a pet shop to buy a mynah bird for her aunt. While in the pet shop, she meets a man named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) who mistakes her for a shop clerk. Melanie pretends to sell him a pair of lovebirds, until Mitch reveals that he knew her name all along; Mitch is a lawyer who recognizes Melanie from a court appearance where one of her practical jokes backfired and resulted in a damaged window. Melanie is incensed and uses Mitch's license plate number to find out his identity and address. The next day, she buys Mitch a pair of lovebirds and attempts to deliver them to his apartment, but when she tries to leave the birds in his hallway, a neighbor (Richard Deacon) tells her that Mitch spends his weekends at his family home in a small town up the coast called Bodega Bay, and won't return until Monday.Not wanting to let her joke go, Melanie decides to journey to Bodega Bay; she drives up the coast and questions a general store owner in the little town about Mitch's family. He points across the bay to the Brenners' house where Mitch is staying with his mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and his 11-year-old sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). The shopkeeper knows it is Cathy's birthday, but cannot remember the girl's name. Melanie gets the idea to gift the birds to Cathy in order to further embarrass Mitch; to confirm the girl's name, the shopkeeper directs Melanie to the home of the local school teacher, Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). Annie is a lovely woman around Melanie's age, and she understands immediately that Melanie came here to flirt with Mitch.Melanie returns to town and takes a skiff across the bay to the private dock of the Brenner house, sneaking inside and leaving the bird cage in the living room with a note identifying them as a gift for Cathy. When she sneaks back down to her boat, Mitch spots her making her escape and drives around the bay to intercept her at the dock. Before Melanie reaches the dock, a seagull swoops down and gashes her forehead, seemingly in a deliberate attack.Mitch takes Melanie to a local diner to tend to her wound. Not wanting Mitch to realize the lengths to which she went to get his attention, she lies and tells him that her primary reason for coming to Bodega Bay was to visit Annie, a friend of hers from school. While they are there, Lydia arrives and Mitch introduces her to Melanie; Lydia's response to Melanie is icy, especially when Mitch invites her to the house for dinner that night. Melanie, who was not planning on staying for the night, returns to Annie's and rents a room in her house for the evening. Annie welcomes Melanie, but is also jealous of the interest Melanie has in Mitch.At dinner, Melanie meets Cathy, who is ecstatic about the lovebirds. As Melanie and Mitch make small talk, Lydia phones a man who sold her chicken feed. She complains that her chickens will not eat it, and that there must be something wrong with the feed because the neighbor's chickens are behaving the same way. She ends the conversation puzzled after learning that her neighbors didn't buy their feed from her supplier, indicating that the problem is not with the feed but with the chickens. After dinner, Mitch walks Melanie back to her car and they discuss Melanie's past. Mitch teases her about a sensational story that was reported in the social pages about her, and Melanie becomes indignant. He exposes the fact that she lied to him about being old friends with Annie, and Melanie drives off in a huff. Mitch notices a flock of birds lurking menacingly in the dark on a telephone wire near the house.Back at Annie's, Melanie shares a drink with her, and Annie reveals that she and Mitch were lovers once. The cool reception she got from Lydia spoiled their affair, but she relocated to Bodega Bay anyway, wanting to be near Mitch. Mitch calls to apologize and invites Melanie to Cathy's birthday party the next day. Melanie agrees to come and hangs up. She and Annie hear a thump at the front door and find a dead seagull on the porch, wondering how it could have lost its way in the dark when the moon is so bright.The next day at the birthday party, Melanie reveals to Mitch that she is estranged from her mother. She seems envious that Lydia is so close with Mitch, when her own mother abandoned the family. Melanie does not even know her mother's whereabouts. Suddenly, as the children are playing a game, seagulls attack the birthday party, landing on the children and pecking at them. The adults get the children to safety without much incident, but Mitch asks Melanie to wait until after dinner to leave for San Francisco. As they sit in the living room after eating, a flock of swifts invades the home, getting in through the chimney. Mitch gets the birds out of the house, but everyone is shaken, especially Lydia, who seems more fragile than ever. Melanie decides to stay the night.The next morning, Lydia takes Cathy to school and then drops by her neighbor's farm to discuss the matter of the chickens. She finds him dead in his house, his body bloodied and his eyes missing. The windows are shattered and the room is littered with dead seagulls and crows. Lydia rushes back home in shock. While Mitch and the authorities investigate her report of the dead body, Lydia retires to her bed and has a conversation with Melanie. The two of them seem to reach an understanding, and Lydia opens up to her, revealing that after the death of her husband, her greatest fear is that Mitch will abandon her. Melanie offers to bring Cathy home from school when Lydia worries about the possibility of another bird attack.At the school, Annie is leading the children in a song while Melanie waits outside, not wanting to interrupt them. Little by little, crows gather in the playground until the place is swarming with menacing black birds. Melanie warns Annie, and the two of them lead the children out of the school, but the birds hear their feet on the pavement and attack. Melanie, Cathy, and one of Cathy's friends become separated from the others, and Melanie ushers the children into a nearby parked car, when the bird attack suddenly subsides.At the town diner, Melanie calls her father to report the phenomenon of the bird attacks. Her story attracts a lot of attention, but most people are skeptical, including Mrs. Bundy (Ethel Griffie), an elderly woman who is an expert in ornithology. She dismisses Melanie's account as impossible, and contends that birds could never launch a massed attack on humanity because they lack the intelligence. Mitch along with Deputy Dan joins them and backs up Melanie's story, but they are met with more skepticism until another bird attack occurs, this one even greater in scale than the previous ones. This time, all types of birds are involved, and they create havoc resulting in a large explosion at Bodega Bay's gas station. After it subsides, the patrons of the diner are terrified, and one woman becomes hysterical, accusing Melanie of causing of the attacks.Melanie and Mitch go to fetch Cathy at Annie's house, only to find Annie dead in her front yard, a victim of the bird attack. Cathy is safe inside the house, and she tells them that Annie pushed her inside when the birds came, unable to save herself. Back at the Brenner house, Mitch works at barricading the windows and doors in anticipation of another bird attack. Mitch, Cathy, Melanie and Lydia all spend hours inside the house until the sounds of a massive assault on the house reach them. Mitch is barely able to keep the birds from breaking through the barricades, large birds pecking through the wooden reinforcements, and the power to the house is cut. Finally the attack subsides, and the four of them drop off to sleep.Later, Melanie is awakened by a sound from upstairs. She takes a flashlight and is drawn to an upstairs bedroom. When she opens the door, she is confronted by birds that have torn a massive hole in the ceiling and have roosted in the room. They trap Melanie and attack her, pecking at her flesh and clothes. Melanie attempts to fight them off but weakens. The commotion draws the others and they pull her out of the room, but she is badly wounded and in shock. Mitch and Lydia bandage Melanie as best they can, and resolve to escape in order to get her medical attention. Mitch goes outside to prepare the car and opens the door to find the house completely surrounded by rustling birds, as far as the eye can see. True to the unpredictable nature of the phenomenon, the birds allow them to escape in the car and they drive off among the sea of birds and away from Bodega Bay to find help and safety.","

The two holdovers from her old life are that fast and loose reputation, and playing practical jokes at whatever cost and whatever expense the outcome. It is on a prank, this time on her, that she officially meets criminal lawyer Mitch Brenner, the prank largely centered on the topic of birds. Wanting to repay him for the prank, Melanie drives to his weekend home up the coast outside the working class community of Bodega Bay to surprise him, there where he lives with his widowed mother and his eleven year old sister, Lydia Brenner and Cathy Brenner. While Cathy likes Melanie, Lydia is distant toward her, much like she is toward any woman interested in Mitch, such as the local schoolteacher, Annie Hayworth, who originally moved to Bodega Bay from San Francisco four years ago as Mitch's girlfriend at the time. The day of Melanie's arrival in Bodega Bay, a number of odd occurrences happen all with respect to birds, one of those incidents being a sole seagull swooping down and giving her one good peck on the head. With Melanie still in town, the bird occurrences become more frequent, massive and violent, they seemingly wanting to kill. Mitch notices that the attacks go in waves and are generally in the same pattern of the birds massing quietly, attacking all of a sudden then disappearing to mass again quietly somewhere else. Melanie and the Brenners have to decide how long to stay in Bodega Bay before it becomes too dangerous, by which time it may be too late.

"3","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057115/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The year is 1943. During World War II, the Germans have built a special Stalag, or prison camp, designed to house their most troublesome prisoners of war, the ones who make repeated escape attempts. Arriving at the new camp, many of the mostly British prisoners begin immediately to assess its security and begin planning escapes. One American prisoner, Capt. Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) quickly finds a place along the fence where it was difficult for the German guards in the towers to see, and casually tosses his ever-present baseball toward the fence in order to test the Germans, and stepping over the warning wire gets a few machine-gun bullets fired at his feet. Others try different escape tactics; several hide themselves in trucks full of brush as they drive towards the gate, and two of the men even try infiltrating a group of Russian workers marching out of the camp, while two men stage a fight as a diversion. All are quickly found and rooted out, with Hilts and a Scotsman named Archibald Ives being thrown into the ""cooler"", a isolation cell at the far side of the camp. All this in the first 20 minutes after they arrive. Hilts and Ives become friends during their stay in the cooler.After the initial excitement, the POW's begin to make more cohesive plans. The ranking officer of the group, Capt. Ramsey (James Donald) has a meeting with the German Commandant, who assures him escape is impossible, and it would be in everyone's best interest if they would all accept their situation, settle down, and sit out the remainder of the war ""as comfortably as possible"". Ramsey must however remind the Commandant that it is the sworn duty of all the prisoners to try to escape, thus forcing the Germans to use their finite resources and manpower guarding the prisoners, or chasing them down if they succeed in escaping.A few hours later, SS men bring Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) to the camp, as he is a Royal Air Force officer and therefore the responsibility of the Luftwaffe, not the SS. The SS officer promises Bartlett that he will be shot if he is caught escaping again, and then leaves. Bartlett, the leader of many prior escape attempts and nicknamed ""Big X"" by the other British officers, realizes that by putting all their problem prisoners in one camp, the Germans have unwittingly created a fine escape team. Between them, the POW's have considerable experience in tunneling, and have made many escape attempts. Bartlett quickly organizes everyone into teams and get them all to work. Some, like Lt. ""Tunnel King"" Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) begin digging, while Lt. Bob ""Scrounger"" Hendley (James Garner) begins to gather the materials needed to make everything work for an audacious escape by up to 250 prisoners, far more than had ever escaped at once before. Other men are assigned to make uniforms, forge paperwork, and get to know the German guards and their habits. Bartlett plans to dig three tunnels, over 300 feet long, so that there will be other tunnels to use if one is discovered.After a couple of weeks in the cooler, Hilts and Ives are released, and meet with the others. Hilts has his own plan to dig out, a idea that is so simple it just might work, and he intends to try it that night. Wishing him the best, the main team realizes that Hilts may not succeed, but he'll at least distract the Germans from the other attempts. Hilts and Ives start under the fence that night, but they are caught and the next morning they are back in the cooler again.Meanwhile, other prisoners are working on the main escape attempt. Lt. Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) is the forger of the group, and works on fake I.D. papers, while the Aussie Sedgwick (James Coburn) creates amazing tools from scrap metal scavenged around the camp. Lt. Eric Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) has figured out a way to get rid of all the dirt they're bringing up out of the tunnels, by placing it in bags inside their pants, and then scattering it outside. Hundreds of other men help out in other ways. Some establish gardens where dirt may be scattered, and also receive gardening tools that can be repurposed for the escape. Some scavenge wood and other materials from unused beds. Other men march, sing, and otherwise make noise to drown out the sounds made by the men making equipment and digging. Many men act as lookouts, passing signals when the guards approach, so that the men working have plenty of time to shut down their operations without being noticed. Others stage diversions to distract the Germans so that tools and other items may be stolen. Still others simply get in the way, hindering the Germans' routine inspections and gaining precious minutes for the others to avoid being caught.Hendley befriends a young, naive German guard named Werner. He tempts Werner into sharing coffee and chocolate with him, and takes the opportunity to steal Werner's wallet, knowing that Werner does not dare report the theft, since doing so would effectively be admitting socializing with prisoners, an offense which would get him sent to possible death on the Eastern Front. The wallet contains, among other items, Werner's identity card, military paperwork, an Ausweis (permission to be on government property), all items that the forgers need for their work. Later, Hendley is able to use the theft to blackmail Werner into providing him with a camera that Blythe requested. The tunnels get a few feet longer every day, despite stress and fraying tempers, repeated German inspections, and the occasional cave-in underground. The men go to increasing lengths to gather more and more wood to shore up the tunnels. Bartlett decides to concentrate all their efforts on one tunnel for the time being.Hilts is released from the cooler again, and meets with Bartlett. He says he intends to try again on July 7, the next new moon. Bartlett tells Hilts that the men working on the main escape plan still know little of the local geography, and asks Hilts to help by making maps of the area around the camp when he escapes, also getting information about the schedules at the nearest train station, even if it means being caught and returned to the cooler. Hilts prefers to act as a ""lone wolf"" or with his friend Ives, and refuses outright. He and the other Americans in the camp begin to distill alcohol from potatoes grown in the gardens. On the 4th of July, they surprise everyone with gallons of moonshine. A much-needed party breaks out as the prisoners gather outside for a few drinks, while the Germans look on with consternation, having missed the party preparations completely. However, the guards discover the first tunnel during a routine inspection that day. At the height of their celebration the men are suddenly crushed to learn that their greatest hope of escape is now gone. Ives, who had been slowly losing hope, finally cracks and charges the fence, only to be shot and killed. Bitterly resigned, Bartlett tersely tells the men to continue quietly on one of the other tunnels. Hilts, having seen his friend gunned down, changes his mind and decides to help Bartlett, by making the maps he needs. He escapes at the blind spot he saw at the beginning, and turns himself in the next day. Though he's sent to the cooler again, he has the information that Bartlett needed.Work continues on the second tunnel at a frantic pace. The men practice their assumed identities and their German, including one man taking a grave risk by dressing as a German soldier (he could be shot as a spy if caught this way). Blythe discovers that his eyesight has been ruined by all the close-up forging work; he cannot see more than a few inches from his face. He tries to hide his disability from the others, but he does not fool anyone. Danny admits to his friend Willie that he is claustrophobic, and cannot take the fear of digging in the tunnels any longer, and intends to try to escape through the fence. Willie talks him out of it, promising to stay with Danny all the way during the escape. Likewise, Hendley promises to take care of Blythe during the escape, despite Bartlett's misgiving about letting the blind Blythe escape. By the time Hilts is released again, the main group is nearly ready. Their clothes have been tailored to make them look like civilians, they have their fake IDs and other forged papers, and they know where to run, thanks to Hilts. That night is the night of the escape. In the tunnels, Danny's claustrophobia gets the better of him, and he returns to the hut, though he will escape later. Hilts digs the last few feet up to the surface at the end of the tunnel and cautiously pokes his head out, but he finds they've miscalculated; they're 20 feet short of the woods, and now they must try to sneak across open ground without being seen. All the forged travel permits bear the next day's date; they cannot postpone without starting the plan over from scratch. Hilts sets up a rope signal from the woods, and men start to enter the tunnel. Carefully timing the passes of the guards, men begin to escape into the woods. During an air raid, the Germans turn off all the lights, enabling many men to escape during the period of darkness. Afterward, they return to the rope signal. This is a time-consuming process, and Bartlett and his friend Mac must leave their post at the end of the tunnel if they intend to catch their train, passing the instructions regarding the rope signal from man to man. One man stumbles upon exiting the hole, and a guard hears him, though he does not see anything. The next man grows impatient waiting for the rope signal, which Hilts cannot give until the guard leaves the area. He makes a run for it anyway, and the guard sees him, thus stopping the breakout. In the morning, the Germans do a head count and determine that 76 prisoners escaped.Guards and police scour the countryside looking for the prisoners. As the morning train pulls into the station, many of the men are waiting in their disguises, and they quietly get aboard. Others are making their getaway by other means. Sedgwick, the Australian, steals a bicycle. Hilts strings a wire across a rural road, knocking a German soldier off his motorcycle, which Hilts then steals, along with the German's uniform. He heads for neutral Switzerland. Danny and Willie find a rowboat and begin rowing downriver. Others follow the roads, walking or hitchhiking. One is picked up quickly at a roadblock, and as the day progresses, many other prisoners are recaptured, one by one.On the train, the men discover that the Gestapo and the SS are on board. Bartlett and Mac pose as Frenchmen and fool the police; Hendley and Blythe jump from the train instead rather than take the risk. Meanwhile, Sedgwick stows away on board another train. Hilts kicks a German policeman at a roadblock and makes a brazen escape on his stolen motorcycle, eventually losing his pursuers on a farm, where he discards the uniform. He eventually comes within sight of the Swiss border, but finding the crossing heavily guarded, makes a run for it cross country on the motorcycle. Again, the Germans chase him. Cornered at the border fence, he makes a daring jump over the fence but becomes entangled in the barbed wire, and surrenders, showing the Germans his dog tag so that they do not think he is a spy. The first train reaches its destination; Bartlett, Mac, and Ashley-Pitt disembark to get ready for the next leg of their trip. The SS officer who threatened Bartlett with death at the beginning just happens to be there, and he recognizes Bartlett. Ashley-Pitt, realizing what is happening, tackles the officer and shoots him with his own gun, even though he knows he will be quickly shot dead by other policemen in the vicinity, he has sacrificed his own life to save Bartlett. Hendley and Blythe, traveling overland, arrive at an air base, ambush a guard and steal a small airplane, although they are seen doing so. They fly towards Switzerland. Unfortunately, the plane develops mechanical problems before they get there, and the plane crashes. Hendley and Blythe are not seriously injured, but German soldiers arrive on the scene almost immediately. Blythe cannot see them, and they shoot him dead. Hendley is recaptured.Sedgwick, now in France, witnesses three German soldiers killed in a drive-by shooting at an outdoor cafe by French resistance guerrillas. The proprietor, who was in on the ""hit"", agrees to help Sedgwick escape to Spain. Meanwhile, Bartlett and Mac, still posing as Frenchmen, attempt to board a bus for the next leg of their trip. Mac is tricked when a Gestapo officer addresses him in English, and Mac makes the mistake of replying in English, blowing their cover. He and Bartlett must make a run for it. Mac is quickly cornered. Bartlett almost gets away, deceiving several soldiers by speaking perfect German when they confront him. Unfortunately, a nearby SS officer recognized him as having spoken French earlier, and he is recaptured.Eventually, most of the escapees have been rounded up by the Gestapo. As they ride back towards the camp in trucks, fifty prisoners are diverted in another direction, where Bartlett, who'd led all his men in the escape, confesses that even though they've failed the affair has been exhilarating. ""I've never been happier"", he says during a rest stop in an open field. The prisoners turn at the sound of a machine gun bolt, and as they stand helpless, the Gestapo guards gun them all down in cold-blooded murder. The remaining captured prisoners are returned to the camp, and the names of those murdered are read off in a memorial service. Three prisoners escape. Danny and Willie eventually reach a seaport in their rowboat and board a ship bound for Sweden, while the French guerrillas help Sedgwick to the Spanish border, where another man meets him to guide him into Spain.The Commandant of the prison camp is cashiered and taken away in disgrace, and replaced by another officer, punishment for the escape happening on his watch. At the same time, Hilts is returned to the camp. Bruised, bloody, but unbowed, he marches defiantly back into the camp and learns of the murder of most of the other escapees. Staggered at the news, he is hauled off to the cooler. He is locked up in his usual room, and the guard hears Hilts playing with his baseball. The German, who doesn't understand baseball, walks away. The movie ends with the notice that it is dedicated to the fifty men who were murdered.","
    
                    Based on a true story, a group of allied escape artist-type prisoners-of-war (POWs) are all put in an 'escape proof' camp. Their leader decides to try to take out several hundred all at once. The first half of the film is played for comedy as the prisoners mostly outwit their jailers to dig the escape tunnel. The second half is high adventure as they use boats and trains and planes to get out of occupied Europe.

                    In 1942, the Germans have built what they consider an escape-proof POW camp where they plan to house all the problem POWs, i.e. those that have made multiple escape attempts in the past. What the Germans don't realize is that they've put all the best escape minds in one location. If they can't escape, these POWs believe it is their military duty to make the enemy place as much effort into their confinement as possible to divert them from other war related pursuits. Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Bartlett plans not just a one or two man escape at a time like most escape attempts in the past have been, but a massive escape of two hundred fifty men through a series of tunnels - if one tunnel is found, they can focus on the others. Each escapee will be provided with a complete set of forged documents and standard clothing. With their reputations preceding them, each POW is assigned a specific task in carrying out the plan. Somewhat outside of the plot are Captain Hilts and Flying Officer Ives - who spent their first thirty days in camp in the cooler together - they who are unofficially assigned as the decoys who will make more rudimentary escape attempts. They ask Hilts to make a more serious task of reconnaissance of the local town if he ever does successfully escape, which of course means his recapture to bring the information back into camp and more time in the cooler. Beyond basic logistical problems and the Germans finding out what's going on, they have potential problems in certain POWs who may become liabilities dealing with their own personal issues.

    Synopsis
    The year is 1943. During World War II, the Germans have built a special Stalag, or prison camp, designed to house their most troublesome prisoners of war, the ones who make repeated escape attempts. Arriving at the new camp, many of the mostly British prisoners begin immediately to assess its security and begin planning escapes. One American prisoner, Capt. Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) quickly finds a place along the fence where it was difficult for the German guards in the towers to see, and casually tosses his ever-present baseball toward the fence in order to test the Germans, and stepping over the warning wire gets a few machine-gun bullets fired at his feet. Others try different escape tactics; several hide themselves in trucks full of brush as they drive towards the gate, and two of the men even try infiltrating a group of Russian workers marching out of the camp, while two men stage a fight as a diversion. All are quickly found and rooted out, with Hilts and a Scotsman named Archibald Ives being thrown into the ""cooler"", a isolation cell at the far side of the camp. All this in the first 20 minutes after they arrive. Hilts and Ives become friends during their stay in the cooler.After the initial excitement, the POW's begin to make more cohesive plans. The ranking officer of the group, Capt. Ramsey (James Donald) has a meeting with the German Commandant, who assures him escape is impossible, and it would be in everyone's best interest if they would all accept their situation, settle down, and sit out the remainder of the war ""as comfortably as possible"". Ramsey must however remind the Commandant that it is the sworn duty of all the prisoners to try to escape, thus forcing the Germans to use their finite resources and manpower guarding the prisoners, or chasing them down if they succeed in escaping.A few hours later, SS men bring Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) to the camp, as he is a Royal Air Force officer and therefore the responsibility of the Luftwaffe, not the SS. The SS officer promises Bartlett that he will be shot if he is caught escaping again, and then leaves. Bartlett, the leader of many prior escape attempts and nicknamed ""Big X"" by the other British officers, realizes that by putting all their problem prisoners in one camp, the Germans have unwittingly created a fine escape team. Between them, the POW's have considerable experience in tunneling, and have made many escape attempts. Bartlett quickly organizes everyone into teams and get them all to work. Some, like Lt. ""Tunnel King"" Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) begin digging, while Lt. Bob ""Scrounger"" Hendley (James Garner) begins to gather the materials needed to make everything work for an audacious escape by up to 250 prisoners, far more than had ever escaped at once before. Other men are assigned to make uniforms, forge paperwork, and get to know the German guards and their habits. Bartlett plans to dig three tunnels, over 300 feet long, so that there will be other tunnels to use if one is discovered.After a couple of weeks in the cooler, Hilts and Ives are released, and meet with the others. Hilts has his own plan to dig out, a idea that is so simple it just might work, and he intends to try it that night. Wishing him the best, the main team realizes that Hilts may not succeed, but he'll at least distract the Germans from the other attempts. Hilts and Ives start under the fence that night, but they are caught and the next morning they are back in the cooler again.Meanwhile, other prisoners are working on the main escape attempt. Lt. Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) is the forger of the group, and works on fake I.D. papers, while the Aussie Sedgwick (James Coburn) creates amazing tools from scrap metal scavenged around the camp. Lt. Eric Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) has figured out a way to get rid of all the dirt they're bringing up out of the tunnels, by placing it in bags inside their pants, and then scattering it outside. Hundreds of other men help out in other ways. Some establish gardens where dirt may be scattered, and also receive gardening tools that can be repurposed for the escape. Some scavenge wood and other materials from unused beds. Other men march, sing, and otherwise make noise to drown out the sounds made by the men making equipment and digging. Many men act as lookouts, passing signals when the guards approach, so that the men working have plenty of time to shut down their operations without being noticed. Others stage diversions to distract the Germans so that tools and other items may be stolen. Still others simply get in the way, hindering the Germans' routine inspections and gaining precious minutes for the others to avoid being caught.Hendley befriends a young, naive German guard named Werner. He tempts Werner into sharing coffee and chocolate with him, and takes the opportunity to steal Werner's wallet, knowing that Werner does not dare report the theft, since doing so would effectively be admitting socializing with prisoners, an offense which would get him sent to possible death on the Eastern Front. The wallet contains, among other items, Werner's identity card, military paperwork, an Ausweis (permission to be on government property), all items that the forgers need for their work. Later, Hendley is able to use the theft to blackmail Werner into providing him with a camera that Blythe requested. The tunnels get a few feet longer every day, despite stress and fraying tempers, repeated German inspections, and the occasional cave-in underground. The men go to increasing lengths to gather more and more wood to shore up the tunnels. Bartlett decides to concentrate all their efforts on one tunnel for the time being.Hilts is released from the cooler again, and meets with Bartlett. He says he intends to try again on July 7, the next new moon. Bartlett tells Hilts that the men working on the main escape plan still know little of the local geography, and asks Hilts to help by making maps of the area around the camp when he escapes, also getting information about the schedules at the nearest train station, even if it means being caught and returned to the cooler. Hilts prefers to act as a ""lone wolf"" or with his friend Ives, and refuses outright. He and the other Americans in the camp begin to distill alcohol from potatoes grown in the gardens. On the 4th of July, they surprise everyone with gallons of moonshine. A much-needed party breaks out as the prisoners gather outside for a few drinks, while the Germans look on with consternation, having missed the party preparations completely. However, the guards discover the first tunnel during a routine inspection that day. At the height of their celebration the men are suddenly crushed to learn that their greatest hope of escape is now gone. Ives, who had been slowly losing hope, finally cracks and charges the fence, only to be shot and killed. Bitterly resigned, Bartlett tersely tells the men to continue quietly on one of the other tunnels. Hilts, having seen his friend gunned down, changes his mind and decides to help Bartlett, by making the maps he needs.

Blythe discovers that his eyesight has been ruined by all the close-up forging work; he cannot see more than a few inches from his face. He tries to hide his disability from the others, but he does not fool anyone.

Willie talks him out of it, promising to stay with Danny all the way during the escape. Likewise, Hendley promises to take care of Blythe during the escape, despite Bartlett's misgiving about letting the blind Blythe escape. By the time Hilts is released again, the main group is nearly ready.

In ""Adelina"", unemployed Carmine Sbaratti and his wife Adelina Sbaratti survive through Adelina selling black market cigarettes on the street. They are unable to pay for the furniture they bought (which is under Adelina's name), but are able to avoid the bailiff when he comes for the money or to repossess.

"5","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057193/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film begins with an accident on a lonely freeway in the Southern California desert: Ex-con Smiler Grogan (Jimmy Durante) loses control of his car and drives it off a cliff. A group of motorists -- dentist Melville Crump (Sid Caesar), best friends and comediens Dingy Bell (Mickey Rooney) and Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett), entrepreneur J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle), and trucker Lennie Pike (Jonathan Winters) -- stop to assist Grogan, but he is fatally injured. In his last words, he mentions a cache of loot he hid under a big W at a park in Santa Rosita. The police arrive, but to get out of being held for questioning, all the motorists inform them Grogan was raving and didn't mention anything significant.The motorists continue their separate ways: Crump is on honeymoon with his wife Monica (Edie Adams), Dingy and Benjy are on holiday to Vegas, Pike has furniture to transport to Yuma, and Finch, his young wife Emmeline (Dorothy Provine), and his mean, overbearing mother-in-law Mrs. Marcus (Ethel Merman) were on vacation at Lake Mead, but eventually they all decide to stop and discuss Grogan's words. They try to reason with each other for a fair share, but inevitably matters deteriorate as it becomes clear that all of them are too greedy to divide the money equally, with each party demanding a bigger cut should they find the buried cash. It leads to Benjy deciding to plan a full-out race to get to the money, and everyone gets back into their vehicles and drives off.Dingy and Benjy race against the Crumps to get a plane to fly to Santa Rosita. The Crumps win and charter a pilot, who owns a rickety World War I biplane in which they make the journey, but when they go to a hardware store to get shovels to dig out the money, the place closes down and they end up trapped inside.Dingy and Benjy drive to another airport and hire Tyler Fitzgerald (Jim Backus), a millionaire who loves to drink and fly, to take them to Santa Rosita, but en route Tyler gets drunk and passes out, forcing the two to fly the plane on their own.Pike crashes his truck into the Finches, putting both vehicles out of comission. They force him to go get them another automobile by having him ride a bicycle from inside his truck. The Finches later get a ride with Colonel Hawthorne (Terry Thomas), a British officer on holiday, and leave Pike behind.Mrs. Marcus hits on a brilliant idea: Her devoted son, Sylvester (Dick Shawn), is a lifeguard in Santa Rosita, so she tries to contact him, but he's busy dancing with a bikini-clad girl. Besides, Russell doesn't trust Sylvester not to take the money and steal away, and gets into an argument with Mrs. Marcus, resulting in Hawthorne and Russell abandoning Emmeline and her mother, and going ahead on their own. Mrs. Marcus eventually manages to call Sylvester, but he mishears her and thinks Russell got her into trouble, so he leaves Santa Rosita to go save her.Pike meanwhile gets a ride with sneaky, smooth-talking motorist Otto Meyer (Phil Silvers). A desperate Pike makes the foolish mistake of telling Meyer the whole situation to get his cooperation and a lift, and is abandoned on the road, as the greedy Meyer decides to go for the money for himself. An enraged Pike chases Meyer to a gas station where Meyer stopped to get a tire fixed, but Meyer convinces the gas attendants, Irwin and Ray, to tie him up. This doesn't stop Pike: He wrecks the station and makes off with the attendants' tow truck. He reluctantly picks up Mrs. Marcus and Emmeline, and later Sylvester, Russell, and Hawthorne, who've been quarreling.Meanwhile, Meyer stops to give a ride to a miner stranded on the side of the road and is forced to help the miner drive down a rocky mountainside to his cabin so the miner can deliver medicine to his sick wife. But after dropping the miner off, Meyer finds himself stuck in a ravine, unable to drive his car up the steep hills. The miner's son decides to show Meyer an ""easy way back"" to the main road. The trail leads Meyer and the miner's son down another steep hillside and to a river. Attempting to cross the river, Meyer's car sinks, but he manages to swim ashore. After walking back to the main road, Meyer manages to catch a ride with a nervous man (Don Knotts) who Meyer manages to con out of his car and carry on to Santa Rosita alone.Observing the whole manic marathon is Captain C.G. Culpepper (Spencer Tracy), a Santa Rosita cop and precinct commander who'd been tracking Smiler Grogan for years, and suspects that Grogan might have told the motorists about his hidden cash, confirmed by their erratic behavior. Culpepper's plan is to have the motorists followed by the state police hoping they find the money, then confiscate it and turn it over to the authorities and he can retire with his career on a successful note. However, he suffers family troubles: His wife constantly nags him; his daughter is always moody and running off; and his friend the police chief (William Demerist) tells him that his modest retirement pension won't be raised because his honesty has created enmity within the force. After thinking it over, and when discovery of the money is close at hand, Culpepper decides on a rash plan to move in and take off with all of the money for himself to Mexico as soon as he confiscates it.Everybody eventually converges on Santa Rosita: The Crumps have blasted out of the hardware store using dynamite, and Dingy and Benjy manage to land the plane; each duo commandeers a taxi to the park, each of whose drivers suspects something and get into the hunt. The others also arrive, and Culpepper surreptitiously slips in to follow them. The motorists manage to discover the Big W, four palm trees growing in a W shape, and find the money buried there, as Grogan promised. As they argue over how to split it, Culpepper introduces himself as an officer of the law, confiscates the money, and recommends that they turn themselves in so that the judge will be lenient and reduce their sentences.The motorists see Culpepper drive away, realize they've been had, and go after him (Dingy wants to return the money to the authorities to get a reward, while the greedy Mrs. Marcus wants the money for herself).

    Synopsis
    The film begins with an accident on a lonely freeway in the Southern California desert: Ex-con Smiler Grogan (Jimmy Durante) loses control of his car and drives it off a cliff. A group of motorists -- dentist Melville Crump (Sid Caesar), best friends and comediens Dingy Bell (Mickey Rooney) and Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett), entrepreneur J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle), and trucker Lennie Pike (Jonathan Winters) -- stop to assist Grogan, but he is fatally injured. In his last words, he mentions a cache of loot he hid under a big W at a park in Santa Rosita. The police arrive, but to get out of being held for questioning, all the motorists inform them Grogan was raving and didn't mention anything significant.The motorists continue their separate ways: Crump is on honeymoon with his wife Monica (Edie Adams), Dingy and Benjy are on holiday to Vegas, Pike has furniture to transport to Yuma, and Finch, his young wife Emmeline (Dorothy Provine), and his mean, overbearing mother-in-law Mrs. Marcus (Ethel Merman) were on vacation at Lake Mead, but eventually they all decide to stop and discuss Grogan's words. They try to reason with each other for a fair share, but inevitably matters deteriorate as it becomes clear that all of them are too greedy to divide the money equally, with each party demanding a bigger cut should they find the buried cash. It leads to Benjy deciding to plan a full-out race to get to the money, and everyone gets back into their vehicles and drives off.Dingy and Benjy race against the Crumps to get a plane to fly to Santa Rosita.

He is followed by a hulking, light blonde-haired man dressed in black, who effectively eludes him. The blonde-haired man emerges from behind a hedge, pulling a garrote wire from his watch, which he slips around Bond's neck. Bond is dead in a few moments. A rubber mask made to look like Bond's face is peeled from the dead man's face by the blonde-haired killer, revealing a nameless imposter. The assassin's supervisors emerge, documenting the mission time and revealing that the mission is a training exercise for SMERSH.At a championship chess match, Chief Planning Officer for the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion (SPECTRE), a Pole named Kronsteen, aka Number Five (Vladek Sheybal), wins the match and is called away to meet with the Chief of SPECTRE, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, aka Number One (who's face remains unseen). Also at the meeting is ex-SMERSH Colonel, now Chief Operations Officer for SPECTRE, Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), aka Number Three.Blofeld holds a white Siamese cat in his lap when he meets with his underlings. He also kept three Siamese fighting fish in an aquarium. Blofeld comments that the fish naturally fight each other, but while two are fighting, there's always one that holds back until the other two stop. Then, that cunning fish attacks the weakened victor and kills it easily. Thus SPECTRE's main strategy is to instigate conflict between two powerful enemies, hoping that they will exhaust themselves and be vulnerable when SPECTRE moves to seize power.Kronsteen devises a plot to steal a Lektor cryptographic device from the Soviets and sell it back to them, while exacting revenge on Bond for killing their agent, Dr. No the previous year. The plan is to trick Agent 007, James Bond (Sean Connery) into collaborating with a Soviet agent in stealing the Lektor from the Soviet embassy in Istanbul, which they will then take from Bond, while framing him and the Russian for the deed. Klebb will be in charge of the operation.To lure Bond into the trap, Klebb recruits Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul. Romanova is an unwitting pawn, as she thinks Klebb is still working for SMERSH. Tatiana's cover story will be that she is a Soviet consulate clerk in Turkey who wants to defect to England.In England, Bond is in a small boat near a river, making out with his sometime girlfriend, Sylvia Trench (Eunice Gayson), when he's summoned to MI6's London headquarters to meet with ""M"", Chief of British Intelligence, (Bernard Lee). As he enters the main office, Bond tosses his hat across the room and neatly onto the hat rack.M tells Bond that Romanova has contacted their ""Station 'T'"" in Turkey, offering to defect with a Lektor, which MI6 and the CIA have been after for years; however, Romanova has stated she will only defect to Bond, whose photo she has allegedly found in a Soviet intelligence file. M and Bond suspect a trap with this Lektor business, but M orders Bond to Istanbul anyway, telling him to meet with British Intelligence Station Chief in Istanbul, Ali Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendáriz).Bond's armorer, Major Boothroyd (Desmond Llewelyn), the head of Q Section, provides Bond with a briefcase containing a tear gas bomb that detonates if the case is improperly opened, a folding AR-7 sniper rifle with twenty rounds of ammunition, a throwing knife, and 50 gold sovereigns.At the SMERSH training facility, Klebb arrives by helicopter and meets with Morzeny (Walter Gotell), the SPECTRE thug who trains personnel on SPECTRE Island. Morzeny takes her to a man named Donald 'Red' Grant (Robert Shaw), the same hulking, blonde-haired assassin that killed the impostor Bond during the training exercise. Grant is in the process of getting a massage from a beautiful woman (Jan Williams) on the lawn outside at a small lake after an exercise workout. As Klebb walks with Morzeny and his chief aide through the training area, Klebb reads from the file that Morzeny gives her explaining that Grant is an Irish national who escaped from Dartmorth Prison in England back in 1960 where he was serving a life sentence for a murder charge and recruited by SPECTRE while he was hiding out in Tangiers the previous year in 1962. Morzeny describes Grant as being diagnosed as a ""homicidal-paranoia"" which is ""superb materal"" for SPECTRE, and despite Grant's lack of social skills and crude manners, his training as an assassin by SPECTRE has been remarkable.Klebb directs Morzeny to call Grant over. Grant hurries over and Klebb looks his body up and down, then slides some brass knuckles onto her fingers and delivers a solid blow to his solar plexus. Grant doesn't even flinch from the blow, so she decides he'll do, and she orders him to be sent to Istanbul by tomorrow, where he will be the second main player in her plot.A few days later, Bond arrives in Istanbul and is driven to Kerim Bey's offices. The car is followed from the airport, by both local Bulgarian operatives (who spy for the Soviets) and Red Grant. Bond's driver, Bey's son, assures Bond that there is no danger, as they and the KGB's operatives tail each other constantly in Istanbul. However, Grant ambushes and kills the Bulgar driver, leaving the body in the backseat of the car where it will be quickly discovered.Bond meets with Bey, who informs him that the Soviet embassy, though heavily protected, can be infiltrated and the Lektor can be stolen.Bond checks into his hotel, asking to be given another room when he finds a listening device behind a painting in his assigned room. He is told the bridal suite is the only other room available, so he accepts.That evening, Bey, relaxing with his mistress (Nadja Regin) at his office, is nearly killed when the retaliatory bomb goes off. Nadja had lured him away from the blast zone only moments before. The next morning, Bond goes to Bey's office, where he's briefed on the incident.Bey takes Bond to the city's underground reservoir below his offices. They climb into a rowboat and travel a short distance to the area directly beneath the Soviet embassy. Bey has installed a surplus British submarine periscope, which elevates under a table in the embassy's conference room. Bey and Bond then look to see who is meeting there.They identify Krilencu (Fred Haggerty), a Bulgarian assassin who works as a killer for the Soviets in the Balkans. Bey tells Bond that Krilencu has been gone from Istanbul for a year, so it's curious that he's returned. Bey suspects it must have been Krilencu who planted the bomb that nearly killed him. Bey desires revenge, but chooses not to, not wanting to do anything that might jeopardize Bond's mission. As Bond peers through the eyepiece, a beautiful woman walks in. Bond and Bey are unable to identify her because her face doesn't come into view.Bey takes Bond to a gypsy camp outside the city for the evening to hide out. Bond meets Vavra (Francis de Wolff), the chief of the tribe who does dangerous work for Bey now and then. After watching Leila (Lisa Guiraut), a belly dancer, perform, the chief of the camp orders two young women, Vida (Aliza Gur) and Zora (Martine Beswick), who both seek to marry his son, to be brought from their wagons. In accordance with Gypsy tradition, the two women must fight, with the winner to be the bride.Vida and Zora are in the early stages of their vicious cat-fight, when the camp is attacked by Krilencu and his Bulgarian thugs. In the ensuing gunfight and chaos, Bey is shot in the right arm and Bond is saved by Grant, who, from a hidden position observing the camp, shoots a man intending to attack Bond with a sword. Grant's purpose is to make sure Bond is able to complete his mission.After the KGB men withdraw, Vavra declares Bond to be one of his ""sons,"" in honor of Bond's bravery and assistance. Bond thanks him, then requests a favor of the chief: he asks that the fight between the women be stopped. The man laughs, suggesting that Bond is too softhearted to be a gypsy, but he agrees to let Bond make the decision.The following night, Bey resolves to kill Krilencu. He and Bond go to Krilencu's hideout, where Bey has two of his operatives working as Turkish policemen. The policemen knock on the Krilencu's door, a deliberate move to force Krilencu into fleeing his hideout. They then see Krilencu attempting to use an escape hatch built into a large billboard on the building. Krilencu drops a rope along the outside the building and starts down. He's an easy target for Bey, who uses Bond's sniper rifle, with Bond's shoulder as support, to shoot Krilencu. Krilencu falls to the ground dead.Bond returns to his hotel room and is just about to take a relaxing bath when he hears noises in the main room. He puts on a towel and sneaks out of the bathroom, moving over to where he had set his pistol. He picks up his gun and then sees a human shadow disappearing out on the patio. He follows in that direction and into the adjacent room, where there's a beautiful young woman lying in her bed. It is Tatiana. She'd lured him over there.They introduce themselves and within minutes they are making love, deciding to discuss the details of how they'll go about obtaining the Lektor machine in the morning. The two are unaware that their encounter is being filmed from behind a one-way mirror by Klebb and a cameraman.The next day, Bond arranges to meet with Tatiana at the Hagia Sophia Cathedral, intending to receive a map of the Russian Consulate from her. Tatiana leaves the map at the base of a pillar, but a KGB agent, who was trailing her, reaches it before Bond can. Grant moves in and kills the KGB agent and again quickly slips away, unseen by Bond or Tatiana. Bond reaches the dead KGB man and finds the map still clutched in his hand. He takes the map and leaves, wondering who might have killed the agent.Bond takes the map to Bey, who determines that a bomb set off in the consulate would be enough of a distraction for Bond to enter the communications room, steal the Lektor, and escape with Tatiana into the caverns below the city.Bond later meets with Tatiana on a ferry, where he uses a tape recorder made up to look like a camera, to record Tatiana's description of the Lektor. The recording is subsequently listened to by M and several other high level officials, who determine that the device Tatiana speaks of is authentic. Q's secretary, Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), was also listening to the tape, until M told her to leave, as Tatiana kept flirting with James in between her statements describing the Lektor. Miss Moneypenny is able to listen in via the office intercom. She seems both amused and jealous at what she's hearing.M orders Bond to go ahead with the plan to acquire the Lektor.Bond reports to the Soviet embassy at precisely 3:00 p.m. under the guise of the intent to purchase a visa for travel to the USSR. A few minutes later, a bomb goes off, having been placed near the wall to the communications room. The explosion breaks a hole in the wall of the room and Bond slips in easily, to grab both the Lektor and Tatiana, and they escape into the caverns. They are led outside by Bey.Bond's escape from Istanbul involves a lengthy ride on the Orient Express to Trieste in Italy. Bey has reserved a sleeper car for both Bond and Tatiana, who are posing as a married couple. Bey tells them they he will plan to stop the train at a certain point where Bond and Tatiana are to disembark and to meet another of Bey's sons, who will give them documents and assistance in smuggling the Lektor across the Italian border.On the train, Bey identifies a Soviet security officer named Benz (Peter Bayliss), who is tailing them. Bey makes it his duty to keep a close eye on Benz during the train ride. Bey and Benz later turn up dead in Bey's compartment. The train's conductor (George Pastell), believes they killed each other and he goes to Bond, whom he knew to be an associate of Bey, to let him know. Bond follows the conductor to Bey's compartment and witnesses the scene. He pays the conductor to keep the deaths a secret for the rest of the trip. Bey and Benz were actually the victims of Grant, who was also on the train. With Bey dead, as well as his plan for stopping the train dead with him, the train is forced to go on and does not stop at the rural place where one of Bey's sons are. Bey's men hurry away to find a telephone to find out what happened.Bond briefly suspects that Tatiana had something to do with Kerim Bey's death and roughly interrogates and even hits her, but she claims ignorance to anything going on. Not trusting her anymore, Bond secludes himself and the Lektor device away from Tatiana.That evening the train arrives at the Sarajevo train station in Yugoslavia. Bond briefly disembarks and meets with one of Bey's sons and, after regretfully telling the man that his father had been killed, asks him to arrange for an MI6 agent from Station Y to meet him at the next stop in Zagreb. They are both watched and overhead by Grant still in hiding on the train.A few hours later, Grant leaves the train when it stops in Zagreb and intercepts British Agent Nash, from Station Y, there to meet Bond. Grant kills Nash (off camera) and assumes Nash's place, stealing his hat, wallet, business card and briefcase. Grant then meets Bond for the first time and (speaking for the first time with a rich upper class English accent) introduces himself as ""Captain Nash"". Bond seems immediately suspicious of Grant, because he was late in coming to meet with him. After talking for a while in Bond and Tatiana's cabin, Grant invites Bond to dinner on the train and Bond accepts, but he sends Tatiana on ahead with Grant, telling them he had to tend to something first. Bond then opens the briefcase Grant had been carrying and checks the contents. Inside, he finds Nash's clothes and a pistol, but nothing out of the ordinary. Bond then heads for the dining car.Bond finds it curious that Grant orders red wine with his fish dinner, but says nothing. Toward the end of the meal, Grant drops a sleeping pill into Tatiana's drink. She becomes drowsy and falls asleep in their room. In the adjoining room, Grant deceives Bond into looking at a map. Then, while explaining how he plans to effect their escape across the border, he sneaks a pistol from an ankle holster and hits Bond over the head with it, knocking him out temporarily.When Bond comes to, Grant (now speaking with an Irish accent) reveals that he has been sent to kill both Bond and Romanov and steal the Lektor. Grant further taunts Bond, boasting that SPECTRE has been pitting the Soviets and the British against each other, and claims that Romanova thinks that ""she's doing it all for mother Russia"". He also tells Bond he plans to frame him for Tatiana's murder and cause a scandal involving Bond's earlier tryst with her, which was filmed by Klebb. He tells Bond that after he kills both of them, he will plant the film in her handbag, along with a forged blackmail letter, so it looks like it was a murder-suicide. Bond finally comes to the realization that Grant is not with SMERSH, but is working for SPECTRE. He is impressed by the genius of the plan.Bond offers to double whatever Grant is being paid by SPECTRE, but Grant isn't interested. In fact, he tells Bond that he intends to torture him before killing him. Trying to stall for time, Bond plays his final card; Bond asks for a cigarette, but Grant refuses. Bond offers to pay for it with some gold sovereigns he has in his briefcase. Grant tells Bond to show him the sovereigns. Bond removes the sovereigns from his briefcase (he'd actually transferred them from Nash's briefcase to his own). With a clear hint of greed in his voice, Grant then asks Bond if there are any more gold sovereigns in Nash's briefcase. Bond says 'yes', that it's standard issue briefcase. Bond offers to take a look, and it is here that Grant falls right into the trap. Thinking that Bond has a weapon hidden in the other briefcase (Nash's pistol) Grant decides to open the other case himself.Grant opens the other case the incorrect way (without turning the latches on the briefcase) and the tear gas canister explodes in his face and Bond attacks him. The two fight viciously, slamming each other around, into the room where Tatiana lay sleeping, and then back to the adjoining compartment. Grant attempts to strangle Bond with a garrote wire that he had hidden in his watch, but Bond is able to get to the knife hidden in his briefcase and stab Grant in the arm. Bond eventually strangles Grant with the garrote.One of Grant's cohorts parks a flower truck across the train tracks and forces the train to stop a few minutes later. Bond is barely able to revive Tatiana enough to jump off the train. He hides her behind some shrubs, then jumps back on the outside of the train as it starts up again, riding it just a few hundred feet to near the flower truck, that had been moved from the tracks by a couple of trainmen. James jumps off and the train continues on. The driver is calling out to Grant, wondering where he is. James rushes the driver and knocks him down and out. He binds the man's hands with a belt, then puts him in the cab of the truck and Tatiana in the bed of the truck, with the flowers.The next morning, Bond is driving the truck down the road when a helicopter approaches. There are two men, the pilot and one other. The passenger starts lobbing grenades down at the truck, trying to force it off the road, or at least to stop. James jumps out with his briefcase, puts Tatiana under the truck, then takes off running. He hides under a rock, assembles his rifle, and shoots the helicopter passenger just as he's preparing to toss another grenade at Bond. Bond hits the man's arm causing him to drop the grenade inside the helicopter. It explodes and crashes.At Number One's office, Klebb and Kronsteen are being admonished for the plan having failed. Number Five blames Klebb, while she blames him. Number One presses a button on a panel on his desk and Morzeny enters the room, coming up behind Klebb and Kronsteen. Number One tells them that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure, and he appears to be blaming Klebb directly. Klebb lowers her head and acknowledges, believing she's about to die. Morzeny releases a dagger hidden in the toe of his boot and prepares to kick out at Klebb, but at the last second, he twists his foot and stabs Kronsteen instead. The blade is tipped with a fast-acting venom and Kronsteen falls dead within 12 seconds. Number One remarks that they'll need to work on developing a faster acting poison. Number One then tells a frightened Klebb that she now has total control of the mission and has one last chance to get the Lektor and kill Bond in Italy.Meanwhile, Bond gets the flower truck driver to tell him that Grant was planning to escape by boat, so Bond drives there to a small dock. They get in the boat and head for Trieste. Bond asks the driver if he can swim, then unbinds his hands and pushes him overboard.A few hours into their long boat trip, Bond and Tatiana are intercepted by Morzeny and others, dispersed among three speedboats. They lob grenades and fire automatic weapons at Bond, trying to get him to stop. Some of the bad guys didn't particularly understand their objective, however, and end up hitting several large drums of fuel that were on Bond's boat. Bond releases the holds on the barrels, sending them into the water. When Morzeny sees the barrels floating by, he orders the boats to slow down. Tatiana then hands Bond a flare gun, which he uses to set all the floating fuel and the barrels on fire. Morzeny and his men, crashing into each other's boats, are either killed or forced to jump into the water, as the fire envelopes them.Bond and Tatiana reach Venice and are making preparations to leave for England when Klebb enters their hotel room, disguised as a maid. She holds Bond at gunpoint, ordering Romanov out of the room with the Lektor. Klebb then raises the pistol to kill Bond, but Tatiana rushes back into the room and knocks the gun out of her hand. Bond and Klebb fight. Bond has to grab a chair and pin Klebb against the wall with it, as she was attempting to kick him with the poisoned dagger in the toe of her shoe. Tatiana recovers Klebb's pistol and, after a brief and confused hesitation, shoots Klebb, killing her.In the final scene, Bond and Tatiana take a romantic pleasure cruise on Venice's Grand Canal. Tatiana returns the wedding band that MI6 had provided for the mission and Bond puts it in his pocket for safekeeping until he can return it. He then removes from his pocket the film of his and Tatiana's night together, pulling it out partway and examining some of the frames.

    Synopsis
    At the Spetsyalnye Metody Razoblacheniya SHpyonov (SMERSH), aka, Special Methods of Spy Detection, training facility, British MI6 Agent 007, James Bond, is making his way through the grounds. He is followed by a hulking, light blonde-haired man dressed in black, who effectively eludes him. The blonde-haired man emerges from behind a hedge, pulling a garrote wire from his watch, which he slips around Bond's neck. Bond is dead in a few moments. A rubber mask made to look like Bond's face is peeled from the dead man's face by the blonde-haired killer, revealing a nameless imposter. The assassin's supervisors emerge, documenting the mission time and revealing that the mission is a training exercise for SMERSH.At a championship chess match, Chief Planning Officer for the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion (SPECTRE), a Pole named Kronsteen, aka Number Five (Vladek Sheybal), wins the match and is called away to meet with the Chief of SPECTRE, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, aka Number One (who's face remains unseen). Also at the meeting is ex-SMERSH Colonel, now Chief Operations Officer for SPECTRE, Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), aka Number Three.Blofeld holds a white Siamese cat in his lap when he meets with his underlings. He also kept three Siamese fighting fish in an aquarium. Blofeld comments that the fish naturally fight each other, but while two are fighting, there's always one that holds back until the other two stop. Then, that cunning fish attacks the weakened victor and kills it easily. Thus SPECTRE's main strategy is to instigate conflict between two powerful enemies, hoping that they will exhaust themselves and be vulnerable when SPECTRE moves to seize power.Kronsteen devises a plot to steal a Lektor cryptographic device from the Soviets and sell it back to them, while exacting revenge on Bond for killing their agent, Dr. No the previous year. The plan is to trick Agent 007, James Bond (Sean Connery) into collaborating with a Soviet agent in stealing the Lektor from the Soviet embassy in Istanbul, which they will then take from Bond, while framing him and the Russian for the deed. Klebb will be in charge of the operation.To lure Bond into the trap, Klebb recruits Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul. Romanova is an unwitting pawn, as she thinks Klebb is still working for SMERSH. Tatiana's cover story will be that she is a Soviet consulate clerk in Turkey who wants to defect to England.In England, Bond is in a small boat near a river, making out with his sometime girlfriend, Sylvia Trench (Eunice Gayson), when he's summoned to MI6's London headquarters to meet with ""M"", Chief of British Intelligence, (Bernard Lee). As he enters the main office, Bond tosses his hat across the room and neatly onto the hat rack.M tells Bond that Romanova has contacted their ""Station 'T'"" in Turkey, offering to defect with a Lektor, which MI6 and the CIA have been after for years; however, Romanova has stated she will only defect to Bond, whose photo she has allegedly found in a Soviet intelligence file. M and Bond suspect a trap with this Lektor business, but M orders Bond to Istanbul anyway, telling him to meet with British Intelligence Station Chief in Istanbul, Ali Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendáriz).Bond's armorer, Major Boothroyd (Desmond Llewelyn), the head of Q Section, provides Bond with a briefcase containing a tear gas bomb that detonates if the case is improperly opened, a folding AR-7 sniper rifle with twenty rounds of ammunition, a throwing knife, and 50 gold sovereigns.At the SMERSH training facility, Klebb arrives by helicopter and meets with Morzeny (Walter Gotell), the SPECTRE thug who trains personnel on SPECTRE Island. Morzeny takes her to a man named Donald 'Red' Grant (Robert Shaw), the same hulking, blonde-haired assassin that killed the impostor Bond during the training exercise. Grant is in the process of getting a massage from a beautiful woman (Jan Williams) on the lawn outside at a small lake after an exercise workout. As Klebb walks with Morzeny and his chief aide through the training area, Klebb reads from the file that Morzeny gives her explaining that Grant is an Irish national who escaped from Dartmorth Prison in England back in 1960 where he was serving a life sentence for a murder charge and recruited by SPECTRE while he was hiding out in Tangiers the previous year in 1962. Morzeny describes Grant as being diagnosed as a ""homicidal-paranoia"" which is ""superb materal"" for SPECTRE, and despite Grant's lack of social skills and crude manners, his training as an assassin by SPECTRE has been remarkable.Klebb directs Morzeny to call Grant over. Grant hurries over and Klebb looks his body up and down, then slides some brass knuckles onto her fingers and delivers a solid blow to his solar plexus. Grant doesn't even flinch from the blow, so she decides he'll do, and she orders him to be sent to Istanbul by tomorrow, where he will be the second main player in her plot.A few days later, Bond arrives in Istanbul and is driven to Kerim Bey's offices. The car is followed from the airport, by both local Bulgarian operatives (who spy for the Soviets) and Red Grant. Bond's driver, Bey's son, assures Bond that there is no danger, as they and the KGB's operatives tail each other constantly in Istanbul. However, Grant ambushes and kills the Bulgar driver, leaving the body in the backseat of the car where it will be quickly discovered.Bond meets with Bey, who informs him that the Soviet embassy, though heavily protected, can be infiltrated and the Lektor can be stolen.Bond checks into his hotel, asking to be given another room when he finds a listening device behind a painting in his assigned room. He is told the bridal suite is the only other room available, so he accepts.That evening, Bey, relaxing with his mistress (Nadja Regin) at his office, is nearly killed when the retaliatory bomb goes off. Nadja had lured him away from the blast zone only moments before. The next morning, Bond goes to Bey's office, where he's briefed on the incident.Bey takes Bond to the city's underground reservoir below his offices. They climb into a rowboat and travel a short distance to the area directly beneath the Soviet embassy. Bey has installed a surplus British submarine periscope, which elevates under a table in the embassy's conference room. Bey and Bond then look to see who is meeting there.They identify Krilencu (Fred Haggerty), a Bulgarian assassin who works as a killer for the Soviets in the Balkans. Bey tells Bond that Krilencu has been gone from Istanbul for a year, so it's curious that he's returned. Bey suspects it must have been Krilencu who planted the bomb that nearly killed him. Bey desires revenge, but chooses not to, not wanting to do anything that might jeopardize Bond's mission. As Bond peers through the eyepiece, a beautiful woman walks in. Bond and Bey are unable to identify her because her face doesn't come into view.Bey takes Bond to a gypsy camp outside the city for the evening to hide out. Bond meets Vavra (Francis de Wolff), the chief of the tribe who does dangerous work for Bey now and then. After watching Leila (Lisa Guiraut), a belly dancer, perform, the chief of the camp orders two young women, Vida (Aliza Gur) and Zora (Martine Beswick), who both seek to marry his son, to be brought from their wagons. In accordance with Gypsy tradition, the two women must fight, with the winner to be the bride.Vida and Zora are in the early stages of their vicious cat-fight, when the camp is attacked by Krilencu and his Bulgarian thugs. In the ensuing gunfight and chaos, Bey is shot in the right arm and Bond is saved by Grant, who, from a hidden position observing the camp, shoots a man intending to attack Bond with a sword. Grant's purpose is to make sure Bond is able to complete his mission.After the KGB men withdraw, Vavra declares Bond to be one of his ""sons,"" in honor of Bond's bravery and assistance. Bond thanks him, then requests a favor of the chief: he asks that the fight between the women be stopped. The man laughs, suggesting that Bond is too softhearted to be a gypsy, but he agrees to let Bond make the decision.The following night, Bey resolves to kill Krilencu. He and Bond go to Krilencu's hideout, where Bey has two of his operatives working as Turkish policemen. The policemen knock on the Krilencu's door, a deliberate move to force Krilencu into fleeing his hideout. They then see Krilencu attempting to use an escape hatch built into a large billboard on the building. Krilencu drops a rope along the outside the building and starts down. He's an easy target for Bey, who uses Bond's sniper rifle, with Bond's shoulder as support, to shoot Krilencu. Krilencu falls to the ground dead.Bond returns to his hotel room and is just about to take a relaxing bath when he hears noises in the main room. He puts on a towel and sneaks out of the bathroom, moving over to where he had set his pistol. He picks up his gun and then sees a human shadow disappearing out on the patio. He follows in that direction and into the adjacent room, where there's a beautiful young woman lying in her bed. It is Tatiana. She'd lured him over there.They introduce themselves and within minutes they are making love, deciding to discuss the details of how they'll go about obtaining the Lektor machine in the morning. The two are unaware that their encounter is being filmed from behind a one-way mirror by Klebb and a cameraman.The next day, Bond arranges to meet with Tatiana at the Hagia Sophia Cathedral, intending to receive a map of the Russian Consulate from her. Tatiana leaves the map at the base of a pillar, but a KGB agent, who was trailing her, reaches it before Bond can. Grant moves in and kills the KGB agent and again quickly slips away, unseen by Bond or Tatiana. Bond reaches the dead KGB man and finds the map still clutched in his hand. He takes the map and leaves, wondering who might have killed the agent.Bond takes the map to Bey, who determines that a bomb set off in the consulate would be enough of a distraction for Bond to enter the communications room, steal the Lektor, and escape with Tatiana into the caverns below the city.Bond later meets with Tatiana on a ferry, where he uses a tape recorder made up to look like a camera, to record Tatiana's description of the Lektor. The recording is subsequently listened to by M and several other high level officials, who determine that the device Tatiana speaks of is authentic. Q's secretary, Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), was also listening to the tape, until M told her to leave, as Tatiana kept flirting with James in between her statements describing the Lektor. Miss Moneypenny is able to listen in via the office intercom. She seems both amused and jealous at what she's hearing.M orders Bond to go ahead with the plan to acquire the Lektor.Bond reports to the Soviet embassy at precisely 3:00 p.m. under the guise of the intent to purchase a visa for travel to the USSR. A few minutes later, a bomb goes off, having been placed near the wall to the communications room. The explosion breaks a hole in the wall of the room and Bond slips in easily, to grab both the Lektor and Tatiana, and they escape into the caverns. They are led outside by Bey.Bond's escape from Istanbul involves a lengthy ride on the Orient Express to Trieste in Italy. Bey has reserved a sleeper car for both Bond and Tatiana, who are posing as a married couple. Bey tells them they he will plan to stop the train at a certain point where Bond and Tatiana are to disembark and to meet another of Bey's sons, who will give them documents and assistance in smuggling the Lektor across the Italian border.On the train, Bey identifies a Soviet security officer named Benz (Peter Bayliss), who is tailing them. Bey makes it his duty to keep a close eye on Benz during the train ride. Bey and Benz later turn up dead in Bey's compartment. The train's conductor (George Pastell), believes they killed each other and he goes to Bond, whom he knew to be an associate of Bey, to let him know. Bond follows the conductor to Bey's compartment and witnesses the scene. He pays the conductor to keep the deaths a secret for the rest of the trip. Bey and Benz were actually the victims of Grant, who was also on the train. With Bey dead, as well as his plan for stopping the train dead with him, the train is forced to go on and does not stop at the rural place where one of Bey's sons are. Bey's men hurry away to find a telephone to find out what happened.Bond briefly suspects that Tatiana had something to do with Kerim Bey's death and roughly interrogates and even hits her, but she claims ignorance to anything going on. Not trusting her anymore, Bond secludes himself and the Lektor device away from Tatiana.That evening the train arrives at the Sarajevo train station in Yugoslavia. Bond briefly disembarks and meets with one of Bey's sons and, after regretfully telling the man that his father had been killed, asks him to arrange for an MI6 agent from Station Y to meet him at the next stop in Zagreb. They are both watched and overhead by Grant still in hiding on the train.A few hours later, Grant leaves the train when it stops in Zagreb and intercepts British Agent Nash, from Station Y, there to meet Bond. Grant kills Nash (off camera) and assumes Nash's place, stealing his hat, wallet, business card and briefcase. Grant then meets Bond for the first time and (speaking for the first time with a rich upper class English accent) introduces himself as ""Captain Nash"". Bond seems immediately suspicious of Grant, because he was late in coming to meet with him. After talking for a while in Bond and Tatiana's cabin, Grant invites Bond to dinner on the train and Bond accepts, but he sends Tatiana on ahead with Grant, telling them he had to tend to something first. Bond then opens the briefcase Grant had been carrying and checks the contents. Inside, he finds Nash's clothes and a pistol, but nothing out of the ordinary. Bond then heads for the dining car.Bond finds it curious that Grant orders red wine with his fish dinner, but says nothing. Toward the end of the meal, Grant drops a sleeping pill into Tatiana's drink. She becomes drowsy and falls asleep in their room. In the adjoining room, Grant deceives Bond into looking at a map. Then, while explaining how he plans to effect their escape across the border, he sneaks a pistol from an ankle holster and hits Bond over the head with it, knocking him out temporarily.When Bond comes to, Grant (now speaking with an Irish accent) reveals that he has been sent to kill both Bond and Romanov and steal the Lektor. Grant further taunts Bond, boasting that SPECTRE has been pitting the Soviets and the British against each other, and claims that Romanova thinks that ""she's doing it all for mother Russia"". He also tells Bond he plans to frame him for Tatiana's murder and cause a scandal involving Bond's earlier tryst with her, which was filmed by Klebb. He tells Bond that after he kills both of them, he will plant the film in her handbag, along with a forged blackmail letter, so it looks like it was a murder-suicide. Bond finally comes to the realization that Grant is not with SMERSH, but is working for SPECTRE. He is impressed by the genius of the plan.Bond offers to double whatever Grant is being paid by SPECTRE, but Grant isn't interested. In fact, he tells Bond that he intends to torture him before killing him. Trying to stall for time, Bond plays his final card; Bond asks for a cigarette, but Grant refuses. Bond offers to pay for it with some gold sovereigns he has in his briefcase. Grant tells Bond to show him the sovereigns. Bond removes the sovereigns from his briefcase (he'd actually transferred them from Nash's briefcase to his own). With a clear hint of greed in his voice, Grant then asks Bond if there are any more gold sovereigns in Nash's briefcase. Bond says 'yes', that it's standard issue briefcase. Bond offers to take a look, and it is here that Grant falls right into the trap. Thinking that Bond has a weapon hidden in the other briefcase (Nash's pistol) Grant decides to open the other case himself.Grant opens the other case the incorrect way (without turning the latches on the briefcase) and the tear gas canister explodes in his face and Bond attacks him. The two fight viciously, slamming each other around, into the room where Tatiana lay sleeping, and then back to the adjoining compartment. Grant attempts to strangle Bond with a garrote wire that he had hidden in his watch, but Bond is able to get to the knife hidden in his briefcase and stab Grant in the arm. Bond eventually strangles Grant with the garrote.One of Grant's cohorts parks a flower truck across the train tracks and forces the train to stop a few minutes later. Bond is barely able to revive Tatiana enough to jump off the train. He hides her behind some shrubs, then jumps back on the outside of the train as it starts up again, riding it just a few hundred feet to near the flower truck, that had been moved from the tracks by a couple of trainmen. James jumps off and the train continues on. The driver is calling out to Grant, wondering where he is. James rushes the driver and knocks him down and out. He binds the man's hands with a belt, then puts him in the cab of the truck and Tatiana in the bed of the truck, with the flowers.The next morning, Bond is driving the truck down the road when a helicopter approaches. There are two men, the pilot and one other. The passenger starts lobbing grenades down at the truck, trying to force it off the road, or at least to stop. James jumps out with his briefcase, puts Tatiana under the truck, then takes off running. He hides under a rock, assembles his rifle, and shoots the helicopter passenger just as he's preparing to toss another grenade at Bond. Bond hits the man's arm causing him to drop the grenade inside the helicopter. It explodes and crashes.At Number One's office, Klebb and Kronsteen are being admonished for the plan having failed. Number Five blames Klebb, while she blames him. Number One presses a button on a panel on his desk and Morzeny enters the room, coming up behind Klebb and Kronsteen. Number One tells them that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure, and he appears to be blaming Klebb directly. Klebb lowers her head and acknowledges, believing she's about to die. Morzeny releases a dagger hidden in the toe of his boot and prepares to kick out at Klebb, but at the last second, he twists his foot and stabs Kronsteen instead. The blade is tipped with a fast-acting venom and Kronsteen falls dead within 12 seconds. Number One remarks that they'll need to work on developing a faster acting poison. Number One then tells a frightened Klebb that she now has total control of the mission and has one last chance to get the Lektor and kill Bond in Italy.Meanwhile, Bond gets the flower truck driver to tell him that Grant was planning to escape by boat, so Bond drives there to a small dock. They get in the boat and head for Trieste. Bond asks the driver if he can swim, then unbinds his hands and pushes him overboard.A few hours into their long boat trip, Bond and Tatiana are intercepted by Morzeny and others, dispersed among three speedboats. They lob grenades and fire automatic weapons at Bond, trying to get him to stop. Some of the bad guys didn't particularly understand their objective, however, and end up hitting several large drums of fuel that were on Bond's boat. Bond releases the holds on the barrels, sending them into the water. When Morzeny sees the barrels floating by, he orders the boats to slow down. Tatiana then hands Bond a flare gun, which he uses to set all the floating fuel and the barrels on fire. Morzeny and his men, crashing into each other's boats, are either killed or forced to jump into the water, as the fire envelopes them.Bond and Tatiana reach Venice and are making preparations to leave for England when Klebb enters their hotel room, disguised as a maid. She holds Bond at gunpoint, ordering Romanov out of the room with the Lektor. Klebb then raises the pistol to kill Bond, but Tatiana rushes back into the room and knocks the gun out of her hand. Bond and Klebb fight. Bond has to grab a chair and pin Klebb against the wall with it, as she was attempting to kick him with the poisoned dagger in the toe of her shoe. Tatiana recovers Klebb's pistol and, after a brief and confused hesitation, shoots Klebb, killing her.In the final scene, Bond and Tatiana take a romantic pleasure cruise on Venice's Grand Canal. Tatiana returns the wedding band that MI6 had provided for the mission and Bond puts it in his pocket for safekeeping until he can return it. He then removes from his pocket the film of his and Tatiana's night together, pulling it out partway and examining some of the frames. He kisses Tatiana passionately and throws the film in the river.

Caesar learns that Pompey has fled to netrual Egypt, hoping to enlist the support of the young teenage Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII (Richard O'Sullivan) and his sister Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor).A few months later, Caesar arrives in Alexandria, the then-capital of Egypt. He meets the teenage Ptolemy whom is frequently surrounced by an entourage of ministers and advisers, who seem to do most of the thinking and decision-making for him.

                    In 48 B.C., Caesar pursues Pompey from Pharsalia to Egypt. Ptolemy, now supreme ruler after deposing his older sister, Cleopatra, attempts to gain favor with Caesar by presenting the conquerer with the head of Pompey, borne by his governors, Pothinos and Achillas. To win Caesar's support from her brother, Cleopatra hides herself in a rug, which Apollodorus, her servant, presents to Caesar. The Roman is immediately infatuated; banishing Ptolemy, he declares Cleopatra Egypt's sole ruler and takes her as his mistress. A son, Caesarion, is born of their union. Caesar, however, must return to Italy. Although he is briefly reunited with Cleopatra during a magnificent reception for the queen in Rome, Caesar is assassinated shortly thereafter, and Cleopatra returns to Egypt. When Mark Antony, Caesar's protégé, beholds Cleopatra aboard her elaborate barge at Tarsus some years later, he is smitten and becomes both her lover and military ally. Their liaison notwithstanding, Antony, to consolidate his position in Rome, marries Octavia, sister of the ambitious Octavian. The marriage satisfies no one. Cleopatra is infuriated, and Antony, tiring of his Roman wife, returns to Egypt. There he flaunts his liaison by marrying Cleopatra in a public ceremony. Sensing Antony's weakness, Octavian attacks and defeats his forces at Actium. Alarmed, Cleopatra withdraws her fleet and seeks refuge in her tomb.

Despite Anselmi declaring that this movie should be an easy one to make, he is having problems with his artistic vision, specifically as he does not want to tell a lie on screen. From the stress, he has checked himself into a spa to help him with many of his problems, both professional and personal. As he works through these problems, he reminisces about his childhood and fantasizes about how he either sees things playing out or how he hopes they will play out. Surrounding him at the spa and/or on set are many of the real life people who will be portrayed on screen including: his wife Luisa who he loves but who he does not fully understand especially as it relates to their marriage; his mistress Carla, the antithesis of Luisa; and an actress named Claudia who he sees as providing his ultimate salvation.

                    The seventh anniversary of the death of then pre-teen Kathleen Haloran is approaching, she who died from drowning in the pond on the family estate, Haloran Castle, in Ireland. Since, her mother, the family matriarch Lady Haloran, who still lives in Haloran Castle, has had a maniacal obsession with Kathleen's memory. She holds a memorial ceremony every year on the estate on that anniversary, the ceremony only reserved for those blood members of their immediate family, namely her and her three now adult sons, John Haloran, Richard Haloran and Billy Haloran. She works herself up into a frenzy more so around this time of the year because of the ceremony. And she has deeded her entire estate to a charity in Kathleen's name. None of these facts sit well with John's greedy wife, Louise Haloran, who believes her mother-in-law is crazy. Another soon to be addition to the family is Richard's fiancée, Kane. On the eve of the ceremony, John dies from a heart attack in front of Louise, who hides his death from the family as she tries to work her and John back into the will through an elaborate scheme involving Lady Haloran's obsession with Kathleen, and Louise acting the caring, concerned daughter-in-law. Coinciding with this anniversary is the disappearance of several people from the estate. What those remaining on the estate are unaware of is that the missing people have been hacked to death by an ax murderer. Lady Haloran's physician, Dr. Justin Caleb, takes it upon himself to find out the cause of all the strange goings-on on the estate if only for Lady Haloran's sake. If he or anybody finds out the truth, they will learn that these ax murders are connected to Kathleen's death seven years earlier.

As a result, the scheming woman after disposing of the body, pays a visit to her late husband's family estate in Ireland, the Castle Haloran, pretending that he is still alive, away for business.

Louise forges a letter from John to convince the rest of his family he's been called to New York on important business, and goes to his Irish ancestral home, Castle Haloran, to meet the family and look for a way to ensure a cut of the loot. Seven years earlier John's sister Kathleen was drowned in the pond, and the Halorans enact a morbid ritual in remembrance. Secrets shroud the sister's demise, and soon the family and guests begin experiencing an attrition problem.

However, there is a prophecy that he will be overthrown by a child of Aristo wearing one sandal. When he kills one of Aristo's daughters after she had sought and been granted the protection of Hera, Pelias makes an enemy of the goddess.Twenty years later, Jason (Todd Armstrong), Aristo's son grown to manhood, saves the life of Pelias during a chance encounter, but loses a sandal doing so. He does not know that he has rescued his father's murderer, but Pelias recognizes his nemesis. Pelias keeps his identity secret. However, he cannot just kill Jason; the prophecy also says that he himself would die.When he learns that Jason is undertaking a dangerous quest to obtain the fabled Golden Fleece to rally the people of Thessaly, Pelias encourages him, hoping that he will be killed in the attempt. Men from all over Greece compete for the honor of joining Jason. Since their ship is named the Argo after the ship's builder Argos (Laurence Naismith), they are dubbed the Argonauts. Among those chosen are Hercules (Nigel Green) and Acastus (Gary Raymond), the son of Pelias, who is sent by his father to sabotage the voyage.Jason is taken to Mount Olympus by Hermes (Michael Gwynn) to speak to the gods Zeus (Niall MacGinnis) and Hera (Honor Blackman). Hera tells him that she wishes him well, but that Zeus has imposed restrictions on her assistance (Jason, like all mortals, is a piece in the game which the gods play against each other. This is an accurate portrayal of Greek theology and rarely found in any modern medium). Jason is told that he can only invoke Hera's aid five times (the same number of times his sister called on the goddess by name for help before she was slain). In response to Jason's unasked questions, Hera tells him to search for the Fleece in the land of Colchis, on the other side of the world.Many dangers threaten the expedition. When the Argonauts run perilously low on supplies, Jason turns to Hera. She guides him to the Isle of Bronze, but warns him to take nothing but provisions. However, while chasing some goats, Hercules and his young friend Hylas (John Cairney) find a partially-open treasure chamber of the gods, surmounted by an enormous bronze statue of Talos. Despite Hylas' warning, Hercules steals an enormous brooch pin the size of a javelin. The statue comes to life and attacks, causing much mayhem before Jason can destroy it using Hera's advice. Hylas goes missing and is presumed dead, but the guilt-ridden Hercules refuses to leave until he knows for certain. The other Argonauts will not abandon Hercules, so Jason is forced to call on Hera for the last time. She confirms that Hylas is indeed dead and that Hercules is destined not to continue with them.Hera also directs them to seek out Phineas (Patrick Troughton), the blind seer, for the way to Colchis. They find him tormented by two blue-skinned, bat-like Harpies sent by Zeus to punish him for misusing his gift of prophecy. In return for imprisoning the flying creatures, Phineas tells Jason what he needs to know and gives Jason his only possession, an amulet. To reach Colchis however, they must pass between the Clashing Rocks, a strait flanked by towering rock cliffs that shake and drop boulders to sink any ships attempting to pass between them. Fortunately for the Argonauts, they learn this second hand. Another ship tries to run the strait from the other direction and founders. In despair, Jason throws Phineas' gift into the water; the god Triton emerges and holds back the rocks long enough to let the Argo pass through. On the other side, they pick up three survivors of the other ship, including Medea (Nancy Kovack), the high priestess of the goddess Hecate.They sight Colchis the next day.

With the death of the King, noone can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. With war threatening to tear the country asunder, a stone and anvil appear from the heavens in London town, with a sword planted firmly in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword, read the words, ""Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise king, born of England."" Many try to pull the sword, but none can budge it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the countryside into a dismal state.Out in the woods one day, Sir Kaye is out hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone names 'Wart.' After causing Kaye to miss shooting a deer, Arthur promises to retrieve the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut, wherein resides a sorcerer named Merlin, and his pet owl, Archimedes, who can talk. Merlin explains to Arthur that he was expecting him to appear. After they have tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his home, and after packing up everything in the hut into a small satchel, the two set off.Arthur and Merlin arrive at the castle of Sir Ector, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector, and displays his powers to the doubting Knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, putting him up in the Northwest Tower, a crumbling edifice of the castle.A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to have Kaye train, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kaye's squire.Merlin hears of this news, and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). While walking outside along the castle's moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish, to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both manage to escape.Arthur's tardiness in helping Kaye practice results in him washing dishes. Merlin finds him, and after bewitching the dishes and washing utensils, leads Arthur into the forest, where they both are turned into squirrels by the sorcerer. As Arthur leaps among the trees, he comes across a girl squirrel, who is soon madly infatuated with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute, until he is soon found irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin then changes himself and Arthur back to normal. The girl squirrel who was infatuated with Arthur, skitters away, heartbroken.Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector lectures Merlin for making Arthur shirk his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his 'mouthing off' ends causes Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye's squire, and that that honor will belong to another person of the castle, who is named Hobbes.Arthur is dejected at what has happened, but Merlin tries to get him to persevere, and plans to educate Arthur. As he attempts to explain things, Archimedes interjects on Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin is educating Arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a raving lunatic in their current Dark Ages.Exasperated at this lecturing, Merlin turns teaching duties over to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model plane. Archimedes scoffs at the toy plane, while Merlin attempts to prove that 'man will fly.' His efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below. Even though the plane's flight was a failure, Arthur tells of how he's often dreamed of soaring like a bird. It is then that Merlin uses his magic to fulfill this wish. Archimedes then takes it upon himself to teach Arthur to fly, but is soon impressed by how quickly he has picked up the technique. Their lessons are then interrupted when a hawk appears, chasing Arthur into the nearby woods.Arthur soon finds himself in the thatched hut of a witch named Madam Mim, who playfully shows Arthur her magic powers, which are moreso for evil purposes. As Arthur explains more about Merlin and his magic, Mim decides to 'destroy' the little bird. However, before she can do this, Merlin appears, and Mim proposes a Wizard's Duel.Merlin accepts, and the two head off into the woods, where they then shapeshift into a number of creatures, all in an attempt to destroy the other. It appears that Mim has won, until Merlin turns himself into a germ, causing the witch to become gravely ill. With Mim now safely 'detained,' Merlin, Arthur and Archimedes head back to the castle.Back at the castle a few days later, as Kaye and Ector prepare to head off to London for the tournament, they are informed that Kaye's squire, Hobbes, has come down with a terrible cold. Needing a replacement quickly, Ector recruits Arthur. Arthur then joyfully goes to tell Merlin the news. Archimedes commends the boy, but Merlin is incensed that after all he's done to try and teach Arthur, he has chosen such a demeaning thing as being a squire to Kaye. Arthur tries to reason with Merlin, but the sorcerer grows so upset, that he rockets out of the room, yelling 'Blow me to Bermuda!' Archimedes explains that he's gone to an undiscovered island somewhere, but doesn't know if the sorcerer will return.In London, the tournament is under way, and Kaye is soon up for battle. However, Arthur realizes that he left Kaye's sword back at the inn they are staying at. Kaye furiously yells for Arthur to retrieve it immediately! When Arthur gets there, he is saddened to find the inn locked. As Archimedes looks around, he sees the sword in the stone. With little effort, Arthur draws the sword from it's resting place, and rushes back to the tournament.Kaye is at first angered that the sword isn't his, until Sir Ector notices the inscription, and word spreads that someone has pulled the Sword from the Stone. When Ector asks Arthur how he got it, he refuses to believe the boy could have pulled the sword out himself.Arthur, Ector, Kaye and a crowd return to the stone and anvil, where Ector re-inserts the sword, wanting Arthur to do it again. Kaye brushes the boy aside, feeling that since it's already been pulled, anyone can do it. However, the sword has again become immovable. This causes a stampede of others trying to pull it out, before several people demand that Arthur try again. The rabble dies down, and Arthur tries again...and succeeds where the others have failed.As the legend decrees, Arthur is made King of England. However, he is unsure just what to do, and cries out for Merlin's help. Merlin then returns, back from Bermuda, and the 20th Century. When Arthur explains what happened, Merlin grows happy that it seems that Arthur has fulfilled his destiny, and now plans to help the 'once and future king.'","

It appears that Mim has won, until Merlin turns himself into a germ, causing the witch to become gravely ill. With Mim now safely 'detained,' Merlin, Arthur and Archimedes head back to the castle.Back at the castle a few days later, as Kaye and Ector prepare to head off to London for the tournament, they are informed that Kaye's squire, Hobbes, has come down with a terrible cold. Needing a replacement quickly, Ector recruits Arthur. Arthur then joyfully goes to tell Merlin the news. Archimedes commends the boy, but Merlin is incensed that after all he's done to try and teach Arthur, he has chosen such a demeaning thing as being a squire to Kaye. Arthur tries to reason with Merlin, but the sorcerer grows so upset, that he rockets out of the room, yelling 'Blow me to Bermuda!' Archimedes explains that he's gone to an undiscovered island somewhere, but doesn't know if the sorcerer will return.In London, the tournament is under way, and Kaye is soon up for battle. However, Arthur realizes that he left Kaye's sword back at the inn they are staying at. Kaye furiously yells for Arthur to retrieve it immediately! When Arthur gets there, he is saddened to find the inn locked. As Archimedes looks around, he sees the sword in the stone. With little effort, Arthur draws the sword from it's resting place, and rushes back to the tournament.Kaye is at first angered that the sword isn't his, until Sir Ector notices the inscription, and word spreads that someone has pulled the Sword from the Stone. When Ector asks Arthur how he got it, he refuses to believe the boy could have pulled the sword out himself.Arthur, Ector, Kaye and a crowd return to the stone and anvil, where Ector re-inserts the sword, wanting Arthur to do it again. Kaye brushes the boy aside, feeling that since it's already been pulled, anyone can do it. However, the sword has again become immovable. This causes a stampede of others trying to pull it out, before several people demand that Arthur try again. The rabble dies down, and Arthur tries again...and succeeds where the others have failed.As the legend decrees, Arthur is made King of England. However, he is unsure just what to do, and cries out for Merlin's help. Merlin then returns, back from Bermuda, and the 20th Century. When Arthur explains what happened, Merlin grows happy that it seems that Arthur has fulfilled his destiny, and now plans to help the 'once and future king.'

Before her is food sufficient for three adults, not just one. She is totally oblivious as an automatic pistol, held by a gloved hand, takes direct aim at her. The hand pulls the trigger--and out shoots a harmless water jet that sprays all over her face. Taking off her glasses, Regina looks at young Jean-Louis Gaudet (Thomas Chelimsky), age 8, who suddenly looks very guilty. ""Don't tell me,"" says Reggie, ""you didn't know it was loaded.""She calls out for her friend, Sylvie Gaudet (Dominique Minot), who sends the boy to find some other place to play while she helps Reggie to dry off. Noting the table full of food, Sylvie asks Reggie what's wrong. The answer: Reggie has decided to divorce her husband, Charles. The two stroll through the resort as Reggie says that she is frustrated with Charles' incessant secrecy and lies. Sylvie, a ""modern woman"" to the core, suggests that Reggie simply have affairs on her husband's money, but Reggie doesn't think that way.Just then a dapper gentleman (Cary Grant) approaches, with Jean-Louis in tow, saying that Jean-Louis was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild. As Sylvie takes Jean-Louis back to apologize to the Rothschilds, the mystery man, giving his name out as Peter Joshua, strikes up a conversation with Reggie. Reggie flirts with him almost outrageously, and ""Peter Joshua"" plays along. The two agree to reconnect when they each return to Paris.Reggie arrives home--only to discover that her apartment is totally empty, and even the maid is gone--along with every stitch of clothing, every piece of furniture, and even the rugs. After she opens cabinet after cabinet, finding them all empty, she starts to rush out--and runs pell-mell into Inspector Edouard Grandpierre (Jacques Marin) of the Police Judiciare. Grandpierre asks her to come with him to the Prefecture--and specifically to the Paris Morgue. There Reggie identifies a dead man (in fact it's the man who fell off the Paris-Bordeaux train in his PJs) as her husband.Grandpierre continues the interview in his office. He tells her that the authorities found Charles' body near the railroad tracks, and that he had a steamship ticket to Venezuela on him when he died. The authorities also know that, two days ago, Charles had sold everything in the apartment at public auction. Value: 1,250,000 NF, or $250,000 US. The problem: the authorities in Bordeaux did not find the money. Grandpierre gives back to Reggie all the items that Charles had on him: one wallet containing 4,000 francs, one pocket appointment book listing his last appointment (for the day before, 5:00 p.m., Jardin des Champs-Ëlysées), one steamship ticket, one letter (stamped but not sealed, addressed to Reggie; contents unremarkable), one key to the apartment, one pocket comb, one toothbrush, one tin of tooth powder--and, more incredibly still, four passports, one each Swiss, American, Italian, and Chilean, each under a different name. Of these, Reggie recognizes only the Swiss passport.Reggie goes home, for what it's worth, and stands in the dark, smoking a cigarette, when ""Peter Joshua"" arrives. He says only that he read about Charles Lampert's death in the newspapers and came to be of help. Eventually ""Peter"" offers to take Reggie to a modest hotel near enough to her job at the European Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, where she and Sylvie work as translators.Charles' funeral occurs the next day. Reggie, Sylvie, and Inspector Grandpierre are the only three in attendance. Then three other men come in, one at a time: Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass), who sneezes at Charles; Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), who uses a pocket mirror to make sure that Charles is not breathing; and Herman Scobie (George Kennedy), a hard-bitten man wearing a hook for a right hand, who sticks a pin into Charles to make sure that he will not jump from the pain. Though the other two found seats at the viewing, Scobie stalks out. As Reggie sits and wonders what will happen next, the funeral director touches her shoulder and hands her a note from a ""Hamilton Bartholomew,"" at the United States Embassy, asking her to come in to see him on Monday afternoon.Reggie goes to the Embassy, and there meets Bartholomew (Walter Matthau). He introduces himself as the Paris station chief of the CIA, and says that her husband, known to the CIA as Charles Voss, is wanted for the theft of the $250,000. He also reveals that Gideon, Tex, and Scobie were Charles Lampert/Voss' squad mates in a military unit that Bartholomew does not describe further. He warns her: find that money and turn it over to the American authorities, or her life will remain in danger.Reggie walks to ""The Garden"" (Jardin des Champs-Élysées) and takes in a Punch and Judy show, where ""Peter Joshua"" catches up to her. Not sure how much she can reveal, she confesses that she is frightened. ""Peter"" offers to take ""charge of cheering [her] up,"" and makes a date with her. They go to a nightclub--where Gideon, and then Tex, each threaten Reggie with death if she does not turn over the money to him. Reggie asks ""Peter"" to take her back to their hotel, and while ""Peter"" wants to know what happened at the club, Reggie wants to flirt, and is scared to give any more details. Frustrated, ""Peter"" leaves Reggie to go into her room--and then Reggie, once inside, finds Scobie inside. He has turned the room upside down and now attacks her with his claw ""hand."" She rushes out, finds ""Peter,"" and breathlessly says that ""a man"" tried to kill her. ""Peter"" rushes in, and Reggie hears fight noises, and then silence. She bursts in, and finds that ""Peter"" is a little the worse for wear, and Scobie fled out the window. ""Peter"" tells Reggie to lock herself in, while he goes out the window and gives chase--by jumping from balcony to balcony.In fact, ""Peter"" knows exactly where to go: to Gideon's room on that same floor. He finds Gideon, Tex, and Scobie inside. Tex and Gideon are bawling Scobie out for accosting Reggie by himself. ""Peter"" steps in through the window and joins in the ""bawling out,"" and tells the ""Three Marx Brothers"" to stop ""breathing down [his] neck"" and let him gain Reggie's trust and find out whether she has the money or not. Scobie stalks out again, and ""Peter"" prevails on Tex to let him have his room, which is the room next to Reggie's.""Peter"" goes back down the hall and tells Reggie that he found ""no trace"" of Scobie. Now he insists that Reggie tell him what's happening. She tells him all she knows, which isn't much. ""Peter"" pledges that he will simply not allow any of those three to kill her. In the middle of this conversation, Reggie gets a call--from Scobie, who asks her whether ""Dyle"" is in the room with her. In other words, ""Peter Joshua"" is actually a man named ""Dyle,"" a name she does not recognize. Reggie hangs up, and tells ""Peter"" that the call was simply another threat, and ""Peter"" says that he has ""arranged"" to take the room next to hers.""Peter"" leaves the room, but then, using a thread unraveled from his sock, prepares a trap to let him know whether she's leaving the room. Unaware, Reggie calls Bartholomew and shocks him with the revelation that ""someone else,"" named ""Dyle,"" is also after the money. Bartholomew instructs Reggie to meet him at once at Les Halles, opposite the St. Eustace church. Reggie leaves, figures out that ""Peter"" (now known as ""Dyle"") is behind her, and shakes him loose by paying a taxi to drive off to any old place, and waiting for ""Dyle"" to get into the next cab and say, ""Follow that cab!""At Les Halles, Bartholomew reveals the full story as the CIA knows it: in 1944, five members of the Office of Strategic Services were ordered to go behind German lines and deliver $250,000 in gold to the French Résistance. The five were, of course, Charles, Tex, Gideon, Scobie--and one Carson Dyle. Instead of delivering the gold, they buried it, intending to report that the Germans had captured it. But on their way back to base, a German war patrol ambushed them. Scobie lost his right hand in the attack, and Carson Dyle took several rounds in the stomach. Scobie could still travel, but Dyle was presumably dead, so the four left him behind and returned to base. Charles then double-crossed the other three by stealing all the gold for himself and vanishing.Bartholomew wants to know who the man calling himself ""Dyle"" could possible be, because Carson Dyle is dead. Reluctantly, Reggie agrees. The next morning, she follows ""Dyle"" to the American Express office--where, sure enough, he goes to the ""A to D"" counter to check for mail, and finds nothing. Reggie then goes into a phone booth, calls the operator, and has ""Dyle"" paged. ""Dyle"" answers, and Reggie lets him know that she has him red-handed.""Dyle"" tells a new story: Carson Dyle is his dead brother, and he suspects Gideon, Tex, Scobie, and Charles of having murdered Carson Dyle because he objected to their plan to steal the gold. He also assurs Reggie that he is on her side, not theirs. But in the middle of their conversation, ""Dyle"" drops the telephone and leaves his booth.The reason: Scobie has taken him hostage at gunpoint. Scobie and ""Dyle"" ride to the top floor, where Scobie holds Dyle until the AmEx staff close for the day, then orders ""Dyle"" to the roof. There Scobie demands that ""Dyle"" hand over the money. ""Dyle"" says that he does not have it, and wouldn't surrender it if he did. Scobie orders ""Dyle"" to step off the roof, but gets too close, so ""Dyle"" knocks the gun out of his hand. The two struggle with might and main--and then Scobie falls onto the steeply inclined mansard and ends up hanging by his prosthetic hook from the gutter. ""Dyle"" cheerfully advises him to write ""Love Thy Neighbor"" on the wall 100 times.""Dyle"" goes back to Reggie and tells her that he ""ran into someone with sharp fingernails."" Reggie treats his badly-scratched back, and from him learns his ""new"" last name: Alexander. The two start flirting again, and then Reggie gets another horrifying call from Tex, saying that the three men have Jean-Louis as a hostage.Reggie and ""Dyle"" both show up in Tex's new room. There ""Dyle"" tells the men that of course the boy doesn't have the money, and neither does Reggie. He then offers a new theory: that one of the three found Charles first, cornered him on the train, killed him, and then, without telling the other two, took the money and returned to Paris to blend in until they gave up. He proposes that the three can search his room and Reggies, and he and Reggie will search their rooms. The three men grudgingly agree. Gideon and Tex find Charles' effects in Reggie's room, and don't find anything worth $250,000--whereupon Tex wonders aloud whether ""Dyle"" was right. Reggie and Jean-Louis search Scobie's room and succeed only in finding Scobie's spare prosthetic. Then ""Dyle"" leads them all back to his own room--where they find Scobie, drowned in the bathtub. Gideon and Tex agree to take Scobie back to his own room and dry him off.After the hotel maid (Claudine Berg) makes the inevitable horrifying discovery, Inspector Grandpierre summons Reggie, ""Dyle,"" Gideon, and Tex to his office. He tells them quite severely not to leave Paris until he has found out how these two men died.Reggie and ""Dyle"" spend one-third of their time trying to figure out which of the two remaining cutthroats killed Scobie and Charles, and the rest of the time flirting, first near L'Île de la Cité and then back in her room (where ""Dyle"" famously takes a shower with his clothes on). While this is going on, Bartholomew calls Reggie to tell her that Carson Dyle had no brother. Reggie still agrees to go out to dinner with ""Dyle,"" but at a place with a lot of people: one of the floating restaurants of the Seine.There Reggie tells her mystery man that Carson Dyle had no brother. Whereupon the mystery man, giving the name Adam Canfield, says that he is, quite simply, a thief, and was simply trying to con the three cutthroats out of money they themselves stole. ""Adam"" also tells Reggie, speaking very clearly about such things for the first time, that he is very attracted to her.That night, Gideon takes a call at 3:30 a.m. to come down to the lobby. He gets on the elevator, which then stops between floors, the lights going out. Then the elevator starts again--and goes all the way to the basement. Gideon keeps sneezing--and then lets out a blood-curdling scream that causes the concierge (Bernard Musson) to wake up and call the elevator back to street level--only to find the dead Gideon inside, his throat cut.An angry Grandpierre notes that three men have died, all in their pajamas, and that Tex has disappeared. Grandpierre questions Reggie and ""Adam"" about their whereabouts, and accepts their alibis (for why would they invent the story that each was in his or her room, asleep, and alone?). Satisfied that Tex took the money and ran, ""Adam"" tells Reggie to go back to bed. But then ""Adam"" gets a call from Tex, who now is threatening to stalk ""Adam,"" still known to Tex as ""Dyle,"" for the money!""Adam"" asks Reggie to go over Charles' effects with him one more time; they conclude that their search is at a dead end. But the next morning, ""Adam"" breathlessly goes to see Reggie at the EURESCO offices. He has found the torn-up remnants of the list that Grandpierre prepared of the effects, pasted it back together, and realized that Tex has made off with the appointment book. Reggie recalls the last appointment: Thursday at 5:00 p.m. The two abruptly leave EURESCO and rush to The Garden to look around. They don't know what to look for, but neither does Tex, who also is skulking around.The two then split up. ""Adam"" follows Tex, who wanders into the stamp market, and suddenly realizes the significance! He brushes past Adam, who then also realizes that stamps are the key! The two then race each other back to the hotel. There ""Adam"" catches up with Tex and demands that Tex hand over the stamped-but-unsealed letter. Tex hands ""Adam"" the envelope--but the stamps are torn off, and Tex doesn't have them either.Reggie, meanwhile, has caught up with Sylvie, who tells him that she has brought Jean-Louis to the stamp market, where Jean-Louis hoped to trade the three strange-looking stamps that Reggie gave him. Reggie now realizes that the stamps are the form into which Charles had converted the money! They barely catch up to Jean-Louis, who identifies Monsieur Félix (Paul Bonifas) as the man to whom he sold the stamps. Félix receives them gladly and agrees to sell the stamps back for an amount of money more in line with the collection of tourist-grade stamps he gave Jean-Louis in exchange. The reason: Félix knew that someone had made a mistake, and was just as glad of the honor of owning three of the most valuable stamps in the world, even for five minutes.Reggie rushes back to tell ""Adam,"" but then finds a terrible sight: Tex, bound hand and foot to the two radiators in his room, with a plastic bag over his head, and obviously dead. But worse: he has written the word DYLE on the carpet. To Reggie, DYLE means ""Alexander,"" therefore ""Adam."" Upset, she calls Bartholomew to tell him about finding Tex, and about the stamps. Bartholomew tells her to meet him at once at the center garden at the Palais Royal, near the colonnade.But as Reggie leaves, ""Adam"" is on his way back. So now ""Adam"" gives furious chase to Reggie. She, not able to hail a taxi, tries to shake ""Adam"" in the Paris Métro. She manages to get to the district where the Palais Royal stands, and to shake ""Adam"" long enough to call the American embassy and ask for Hamilton Bartholomew. The operator informs her that Bartholomew has left for the day, so Reggie leaves a breathless message for him.The embassy operator then calls the home of Hamilton Bartholomew (Colin Drake), who is not the man whom Reggie saw in an embassy office! The real Bartholomew is totally mystified and advises the operator to call the French police. But the man who posed as Bartholomew is waiting for Reggie to come to him, with ""Adam"" in hot pursuit.Upon seeing the poseur, ""Adam"" draws his gun and shouts, ""Reggie, stop! That man is Carson Dyle!""How ""Adam"" would know who Carson Dyle is, Reggie has no time to figure out--because the man she thought was a CIA station chief admits that his name really is Carson Dyle, and that he stalked Charles, Scobie, Gideon, and Tex in revenge for having left him for dead. He threatens to kill Reggie if she does not hand over the stamps right then and there--but ""Adam"" has moved from column to column to get closer to Dyle. He takes aim--and misses, but distracts Dyle enough for Reggie to bolt for it.Reggie takes refuge in the Paris Opera House. Dyle follows her in the front door, and ""Adam"" gets in through the stage door and walks down to the lower backstage level. Reggie has taken refuge in a prompt booth, while Dyle walks through the orchestra seating section and then gets up on the stage. ""Adam"" makes a serious mistake: he tries the prompt booth door, and that only lets Dyle know where she is. Slowly he walks, with clumping footsteps, toward the prompt booth--and ""Adam"" realizes that the stage is composed of trap doors. All that ""Adam"" has to do is wait for Dyle to stop walking, identify the right trap door, and throw the switch. And that is how he kills Dyle just as he is drawing back the trigger to kill Reggie.""Adam"" and Reggie go back to the hotel, where Reggie wants ""Adam"" to prove his love to her by telling her to go to the American Embassy and turn in the stamps. ""Adam"" protests that the US government would barely miss the money, but Reggie insists. A Marine directs her to the office of ""Mr. Cruikshank,"" Treasury attaché. She goes there, and ""Adam"" excuses himself, saying that he can't stand the sight of ""all that money being given away."" Reggie goes into the office, announces herself, and then goes into the private office to meet Mr. Cruikshank face-to-face. And he turns out to be none other than the mystery man.Reggie protests strongly at such deception, but the man, whose full and true name is Brian Cruikshank, cheerfully answers all her questions, explaining especially how Carson Dyle could pass himself off as a CIA station chief. (The answer: 12:30 is the lunch hour, and Dyle took the office belonging to none other than the chief of Embassy security!) Reggie still wants more satisfactory identification, and Bryan almost casually says that if she could wait a week, he would ""put it on the marriage license."" Whereupon she breathlessly tells him that she loves him, ""whatever [his] name is,"" and promises to bear him lots of sons and name them all after him.","
    
                    Regina Lampert, a Paris based American, has decided to divorce her Swiss husband, Charles Lampert, because of the secrets and lies that have pervaded their marriage, she coming to the conclusion that she no longer loves him and really knows nothing about him. Before she can make that request to Charles, he is found dead, seemingly pushed off a Paris to Bordeaux train. While Regina was on holiday in Megève, Charles sold all their possessions making $250,000 in the process, and seemed to be on his way to the coast to leave the country for South America probably for good. The money, however, was not among his possessions on the train, those possessions which are returned to Regina. Regina further learns from Hamilton Bartholomew of the CIA that they were after him, Charles Lampert only the primary alias he has been using of late. During WWII, Charles, a member of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), absconded with $250,000 worth of their gold bars that were destined for the French Resistance. The US government wants that money back. Charles had a few partners in crime among the OSS, namely four men: Tex Panthollow, Leopold Gideon, Herman Scobie and Carson Dyle. Besides Dyle who died in the war, Regina knows the other three men are still alive, as she recognized them from a photograph as the three unknown men who attended Charles' funeral. They are now after her as they also want the money which they believe she has, and will kill to get it. She knows nothing about the money, but realizes that it is her duty to find it to return it to its rightful owner, namely the US government, and that it may save her life from Charles' partners. Clues to the money's whereabouts may be among those possessions Charles had on the train. Coming to Regina's aid is Peter Joshua, a man she met while she was in Megève. As Peter helps her, she quickly falls in love with him, and he seemingly with her. Shortly thereafter, she also comes to the realization that Peter is keeping as many secrets as Charles did, and as such he is a person she perhaps should not be trusting.

    Synopsis
    The Paris-Bordeaux express speeds through the French countryside--and suddenly a dead man, clad only in pajamas and a bathrobe, tumbles off the train and down an embankment.The scene shifts to Mégève, the premier ski resort in the French Alps, where Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is sitting at a table on a platform overlooking the mountain.

He finds Gideon, Tex, and Scobie inside. Tex and Gideon are bawling Scobie out for accosting Reggie by himself. ""Peter"" steps in through the window and joins in the ""bawling out,"" and tells the ""Three Marx Brothers"" to stop ""breathing down [his] neck"" and let him gain Reggie's trust and find out whether she has the money or not. Scobie stalks out again, and ""Peter"" prevails on Tex to let him have his room, which is the room next to Reggie's.""Peter"" goes back down the hall and tells Reggie that he found ""no trace"" of Scobie. Now he insists that Reggie tell him what's happening. She tells him all she knows, which isn't much. ""Peter"" pledges that he will simply not allow any of those three to kill her. In the middle of this conversation, Reggie gets a call--from Scobie, who asks her whether ""Dyle"" is in the room with her. In other words, ""Peter Joshua"" is actually a man named ""Dyle,"" a name she does not recognize. Reggie hangs up, and tells ""Peter"" that the call was simply another threat, and ""Peter"" says that he has ""arranged"" to take the room next to hers.""Peter"" leaves the room, but then, using a thread unraveled from his sock, prepares a trap to let him know whether she's leaving the room. Unaware, Reggie calls Bartholomew and shocks him with the revelation that ""someone else,"" named ""Dyle,"" is also after the money. Bartholomew instructs Reggie to meet him at once at Les Halles, opposite the St. Eustace church. Reggie leaves, figures out that ""Peter"" (now known as ""Dyle"") is behind her, and shakes him loose by paying a taxi to drive off to any old place, and waiting for ""Dyle"" to get into the next cab and say, ""Follow that cab!""At Les Halles, Bartholomew reveals the full story as the CIA knows it: in 1944, five members of the Office of Strategic Services were ordered to go behind German lines and deliver $250,000 in gold to the French Résistance. The five were, of course, Charles, Tex, Gideon, Scobie--and one Carson Dyle. Instead of delivering the gold, they buried it, intending to report that the Germans had captured it. But on their way back to base, a German war patrol ambushed them. Scobie lost his right hand in the attack, and Carson Dyle took several rounds in the stomach. Scobie could still travel, but Dyle was presumably dead, so the four left him behind and returned to base. Charles then double-crossed the other three by stealing all the gold for himself and vanishing.Bartholomew wants to know who the man calling himself ""Dyle"" could possible be, because Carson Dyle is dead. Reluctantly, Reggie agrees. The next morning, she follows ""Dyle"" to the American Express office--where, sure enough, he goes to the ""A to D"" counter to check for mail, and finds nothing. Reggie then goes into a phone booth, calls the operator, and has ""Dyle"" paged. ""Dyle"" answers, and Reggie lets him know that she has him red-handed.""Dyle"" tells a new story: Carson Dyle is his dead brother, and he suspects Gideon, Tex, Scobie, and Charles of having murdered Carson Dyle because he objected to their plan to steal the gold. He also assurs Reggie that he is on her side, not theirs. But in the middle of their conversation, ""Dyle"" drops the telephone and leaves his booth.The reason: Scobie has taken him hostage at gunpoint. Scobie and ""Dyle"" ride to the top floor, where Scobie holds Dyle until the AmEx staff close for the day, then orders ""Dyle"" to the roof. There Scobie demands that ""Dyle"" hand over the money. ""Dyle"" says that he does not have it, and wouldn't surrender it if he did. Scobie orders ""Dyle"" to step off the roof, but gets too close, so ""Dyle"" knocks the gun out of his hand. The two struggle with might and main--and then Scobie falls onto the steeply inclined mansard and ends up hanging by his prosthetic hook from the gutter. ""Dyle"" cheerfully advises him to write ""Love Thy Neighbor"" on the wall 100 times.""Dyle"" goes back to Reggie and tells her that he ""ran into someone with sharp fingernails."" Reggie treats his badly-scratched back, and from him learns his ""new"" last name: Alexander. The two start flirting again, and then Reggie gets another horrifying call from Tex, saying that the three men have Jean-Louis as a hostage.Reggie and ""Dyle"" both show up in Tex's new room. There ""Dyle"" tells the men that of course the boy doesn't have the money, and neither does Reggie. He then offers a new theory: that one of the three found Charles first, cornered him on the train, killed him, and then, without telling the other two, took the money and returned to Paris to blend in until they gave up. He proposes that the three can search his room and Reggies, and he and Reggie will search their rooms. The three men grudgingly agree. Gideon and Tex find Charles' effects in Reggie's room, and don't find anything worth $250,000--whereupon Tex wonders aloud whether ""Dyle"" was right. Reggie and Jean-Louis search Scobie's room and succeed only in finding Scobie's spare prosthetic. Then ""Dyle"" leads them all back to his own room--where they find Scobie, drowned in the bathtub. Gideon and Tex agree to take Scobie back to his own room and dry him off.After the hotel maid (Claudine Berg) makes the inevitable horrifying discovery, Inspector Grandpierre summons Reggie, ""Dyle,"" Gideon, and Tex to his office. He tells them quite severely not to leave Paris until he has found out how these two men died.Reggie and ""Dyle"" spend one-third of their time trying to figure out which of the two remaining cutthroats killed Scobie and Charles, and the rest of the time flirting, first near L'Île de la Cité and then back in her room (where ""Dyle"" famously takes a shower with his clothes on). While this is going on, Bartholomew calls Reggie to tell her that Carson Dyle had no brother. Reggie still agrees to go out to dinner with ""Dyle,"" but at a place with a lot of people: one of the floating restaurants of the Seine.There Reggie tells her mystery man that Carson Dyle had no brother. Whereupon the mystery man, giving the name Adam Canfield, says that he is, quite simply, a thief, and was simply trying to con the three cutthroats out of money they themselves stole. ""Adam"" also tells Reggie, speaking very clearly about such things for the first time, that he is very attracted to her.That night, Gideon takes a call at 3:30 a.m. to come down to the lobby. He gets on the elevator, which then stops between floors, the lights going out. Then the elevator starts again--and goes all the way to the basement. Gideon keeps sneezing--and then lets out a blood-curdling scream that causes the concierge (Bernard Musson) to wake up and call the elevator back to street level--only to find the dead Gideon inside, his throat cut.An angry Grandpierre notes that three men have died, all in their pajamas, and that Tex has disappeared. Grandpierre questions Reggie and ""Adam"" about their whereabouts, and accepts their alibis (for why would they invent the story that each was in his or her room, asleep, and alone?). Satisfied that Tex took the money and ran, ""Adam"" tells Reggie to go back to bed. But then ""Adam"" gets a call from Tex, who now is threatening to stalk ""Adam,"" still known to Tex as ""Dyle,"" for the money!""Adam"" asks Reggie to go over Charles' effects with him one more time; they conclude that their search is at a dead end. But the next morning, ""Adam"" breathlessly goes to see Reggie at the EURESCO offices. He has found the torn-up remnants of the list that Grandpierre prepared of the effects, pasted it back together, and realized that Tex has made off with the appointment book. Reggie recalls the last appointment: Thursday at 5:00 p.m. The two abruptly leave EURESCO and rush to The Garden to look around. They don't know what to look for, but neither does Tex, who also is skulking around.The two then split up. ""Adam"" follows Tex, who wanders into the stamp market, and suddenly realizes the significance! He brushes past Adam, who then also realizes that stamps are the key! The two then race each other back to the hotel. There ""Adam"" catches up with Tex and demands that Tex hand over the stamped-but-unsealed letter. Tex hands ""Adam"" the envelope--but the stamps are torn off, and Tex doesn't have them either.Reggie, meanwhile, has caught up with Sylvie, who tells him that she has brought Jean-Louis to the stamp market, where Jean-Louis hoped to trade the three strange-looking stamps that Reggie gave him. Reggie now realizes that the stamps are the form into which Charles had converted the money! They barely catch up to Jean-Louis, who identifies Monsieur Félix (Paul Bonifas) as the man to whom he sold the stamps. Félix receives them gladly and agrees to sell the stamps back for an amount of money more in line with the collection of tourist-grade stamps he gave Jean-Louis in exchange. The reason: Félix knew that someone had made a mistake, and was just as glad of the honor of owning three of the most valuable stamps in the world, even for five minutes.Reggie rushes back to tell ""Adam,"" but then finds a terrible sight: Tex, bound hand and foot to the two radiators in his room, with a plastic bag over his head, and obviously dead. But worse: he has written the word DYLE on the carpet. To Reggie, DYLE means ""Alexander,"" therefore ""Adam."" Upset, she calls Bartholomew to tell him about finding Tex, and about the stamps. Bartholomew tells her to meet him at once at the center garden at the Palais Royal, near the colonnade.But as Reggie leaves, ""Adam"" is on his way back. So now ""Adam"" gives furious chase to Reggie. She, not able to hail a taxi, tries to shake ""Adam"" in the Paris Métro. She manages to get to the district where the Palais Royal stands, and to shake ""Adam"" long enough to call the American embassy and ask for Hamilton Bartholomew. The operator informs her that Bartholomew has left for the day, so Reggie leaves a breathless message for him.The embassy operator then calls the home of Hamilton Bartholomew (Colin Drake), who is not the man whom Reggie saw in an embassy office! The real Bartholomew is totally mystified and advises the operator to call the French police. But the man who posed as Bartholomew is waiting for Reggie to come to him, with ""Adam"" in hot pursuit.Upon seeing the poseur, ""Adam"" draws his gun and shouts, ""Reggie, stop! That man is Carson Dyle!""How ""Adam"" would know who Carson Dyle is, Reggie has no time to figure out--because the man she thought was a CIA station chief admits that his name really is Carson Dyle, and that he stalked Charles, Scobie, Gideon, and Tex in revenge for having left him for dead. He threatens to kill Reggie if she does not hand over the stamps right then and there--but ""Adam"" has moved from column to column to get closer to Dyle. He takes aim--and misses, but distracts Dyle enough for Reggie to bolt for it.Reggie takes refuge in the Paris Opera House. Dyle follows her in the front door, and ""Adam"" gets in through the stage door and walks down to the lower backstage level. Reggie has taken refuge in a prompt booth, while Dyle walks through the orchestra seating section and then gets up on the stage. ""Adam"" makes a serious mistake: he tries the prompt booth door, and that only lets Dyle know where she is. Slowly he walks, with clumping footsteps, toward the prompt booth--and ""Adam"" realizes that the stage is composed of trap doors. All that ""Adam"" has to do is wait for Dyle to stop walking, identify the right trap door, and throw the switch. And that is how he kills Dyle just as he is drawing back the trigger to kill Reggie.""Adam"" and Reggie go back to the hotel, where Reggie wants ""Adam"" to prove his love to her by telling her to go to the American Embassy and turn in the stamps. ""Adam"" protests that the US government would barely miss the money, but Reggie insists. A Marine directs her to the office of ""Mr. Cruikshank,"" Treasury attaché. She goes there, and ""Adam"" excuses himself, saying that he can't stand the sight of ""all that money being given away."" Reggie goes into the office, announces herself, and then goes into the private office to meet Mr. Cruikshank face-to-face. And he turns out to be none other than the mystery man.Reggie protests strongly at such deception, but the man, whose full and true name is Brian Cruikshank, cheerfully answers all her questions, explaining especially how Carson Dyle could pass himself off as a CIA station chief. (The answer: 12:30 is the lunch hour, and Dyle took the office belonging to none other than the chief of Embassy security!) Reggie still wants more satisfactory identification, and Bryan almost casually says that if she could wait a week, he would ""put it on the marriage license."" Whereupon she breathlessly tells him that she loves him, ""whatever [his] name is,"" and promises to bear him lots of sons and name them all after him.

                    In the 1860s, a dying aristocracy struggles to maintain itself against a harsh Sicilian landscape. The film traces with a slow and deliberate rhythm the waning of the noble home of Fabrizio Corbero, Prince of Salina (the Leopard) and the corresponding rise to eminence of the enormously wealthy ex-peasant Don Calogero Sedara. The prince himself refuses to take active steps to halt the decline of his personal fortunes or to help build a new Sicily but his nephew Tancredi, Prince of Falconeri swims with the tide and assures his own position by marrying Don Calogero's beautiful daughter Angelica. The climatic scene is the sumptuous forty-minute ball, where Tancredi introduces Angelica to society.

                    1860 Sicily. Don Fabrizio Corbera, the Prince of Salina, and his family have long lived a life of privilege, largely isolated by the palace walls from the poverty and squalor experienced by the masses due to government corruption that pervades the island. It is however because of that corruption and squalor that he believes that Sicily would be better served being annexed by Italy, and the reason he supports his dashing and ambitious nephew, Tancredi Falconeri, joining Garibaldi's redshirts, who are currently battling the royalist army on the island. Despite loving his family, Don Fabrizio seemingly loves Sicily more as he does whatever he needs to ensure Sicily's strong future. As such, despite learning that his meek daughter Concetta is in love with Tancredi, who would marry her if given the opportunity, Don Fabrizio believes Tancredi needs a stronger wife to support his role in leading Sicily into a bright future with Italy. Who Tancredi eventually chooses is Angelica Sedara, the daughter of nouveau riche, ambitious and unrefined Don Calogero Sedara, and whose beauty is unrivaled against any other young woman she is around. Regardless of the thoughts of others on the matter, Don Fabrizio knows where he fits within the new Sicily.

Lovecrafts The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward, Charles Dexter Ward (Vincent Price) travels with his wife Ann (Debra Paget) to Arkham to inspect a mansion he has inherited. The original lord of the manor was his Great Grandfather Joseph Curwen, a disciple of the devil, who placed a hideous curse on the villagers as they burned him at the stake. Slowly Ward feels the spirit of his ancestor possessing him and seeking a desperate vengeance on the descendants of those who previously thwarted his plans. Accursed mutants...evil possession...will anyone escape The Haunted Palace?In the town of Arkham, in 18th century New England, Ezra Weeden (Leo Gordon) and Micah Smith (Elisha Cook Jr.) follow a young woman named Fitch at a distance. She seems to be in a trance as she walks through a cemetery to a palace door where she knocks and is ushered in by a woman named Hester. Declaring this is the home of Satan himself, Ezra and Micah go to get help. Meanwhile, Hester takes the Fitch woman to Joseph Curwan (Vincent Price), who leads her through a secret door downstairs to a platform in an ancient dungeon cellar. He chains her between two posts on the platform and then he chants in Latin. The woman finally awakes screaming at the sound of some beast growling from below.The townspeople armed with torches arrive at the palace door and knock. Curwan opens it and produces the Fitch girl alive and well, but still in a trance. She answers yes to his claims that she came of her own free will, but when asked by Weeden for her name she cannot answer. The townspeople accuse Curwan of being a warlock and tie him to a tree. He calls out their names: Ezra Weeden, Micah Smith, Benjamin West, Priam Willet (Frank Maxwell), and Gideon Leach. He declares that he will rise from the dead and that this town and they and their families will bear his curse. Then he is set on fire and burned to death.110 years later, a man who looks identical to Curwan, his great-great-grandson Charles Dexter Ward, arrives in Arkham with his wife Ann (Debra Paget), looking for the palace that he has inherited. They are warned that the village is cursed to which Charles scoffs. They enter a tavern called the Burning Man Tavern and tell the people theyre looking for the Curwen family house. Edgar Weeden (a dead ringer for his own ancestor, as are all the other main characters) warns them it is a palace of unknown origin brought stone by stone from some European country. Mr. Willet, a doctor, gives them directions there and shows them where the palace is on the side of a cliff. After they leave, Edgar warns the townspeople that Joseph Curwan has come back to Arkham.The Wards enter the palace and note that the portrait of Joseph Curwan looks just like Charles. Charles seems momentarily possessed by it. As they explore other rooms in the house, a caretaker named Simon (Lon Chaney Jr.) greets them. The attorney had contacted him and he was preparing it for their arrival. Not wishing to stay in a town with such unfriendly people, they tell him they plan to leave at once. But he encourages them to at least spend the night, since there is no place else to go.In his home, Edgar feeds some creature that is behind his locked and barred attic door. It grabs his hand through the bars and Edgar has to use a candle to chase it off. He tells his wife that ""it"" knows Curwan has come back to Arkham. At the palace, the more Ward looks at the painting, the more it seems to possess him. The next morning, Charles tells his wife that he is now planning to stay, just for a few weeks to get the place ready to be sold. She doesn't like it, but agrees to remain.As Charles and Ann walk through town early on a foggy morning, they find the tavern door locked. Then a series of mutated people - a young girl with no eyes, and four other similarly blind, half-blind or otherwise deformed men slowly approach the Wards menacingly until they are surrounded. But the sound of a bell tolling in the distance causes them to disperse and walk away. Later, Dr. Willet tells them all those people were born mutated. Weeden had gathered them together to try and chase the newcomers away. He tells the story of Joseph Curwan, who came to town 150 years ago. His first wife died in childbirth so he took the most beautiful woman in town, Hester, as his mistress a woman who had been promised to Ezra Weeden. Over the years, terrible noises were heard from the castle, and young girls often disappeared at night then were returned with no memory. They concluded he was a warlock a conjurer of the dead. He was thought to have found a legendary book, the Necronomicon, which gave him formulas to summon dark gods from beyond, who had once ruled the world, and now were waiting to take it back again. He was trying to mate the gods with humans to create a new race through which the gods could gain control. The townspeople feel that the mutations were failed experiments. Willet himself can't explain the mutations and advises them to flee the village as if a madman with a knife was chasing them.That night, Charles hears the sound of voices outside but there is no one there. He goes outside to look and Simon finds him and suggests he ""ask Mr. Curwan."" He takes him to the portrait room. After Ward has stared at the portrait for a time, Simon addresses him as Joseph. Ward begins to speak in a different sinister tone of voice. Curwan is now possessing Ward's body, but he tells Simon he feels Ward is still fighting him and he will lose possession of him shortly. He tells Simon and another old friend Jabez to keep Ward there so that he can soon possess him completely. They present him with the Necronomicon. Ann comes downstairs hearing them talk, but when she arrives they are all gone except Ward, who is back to his normal self for now.A week passes, and Ward is still there. The townspeople discuss putting a stop to him. Meanwhile, late one night, he digs up the grave of Hester Tellinghast and he and his crew bring the body into his palace down to the secret cellar. When Ann asks where hes been, he cruelly scolds her and sends her back to her room alone. Joseph's voice calls to him declaring he will never leave him alone and that his will is too strong to fight. When Ann comes back to confront him, he tells her she must leave tomorrow. Ann goes downstairs later looking for Charles but finds Simon instead and faints. Meanwhile, Joseph is chanting in Latin for Hester to return to life, which she finally does, but she is too weak to stay alive. Joseph weakens from the effort and is taken back upstairs where Charles has no memory of what happened. He fears he is going mad, and tells Ann they must both leave in the morning.The next morning they try to leave quickly, but Simon says he must make out a receipt for the week's expenses first. Ann goes ahead to the cab, but Charles stays and falls under Joseph's spell again. Dr. Willet tells Ann about the grave robbery, and says Charles may have done it. Charles emerges from the house, acting like Joseph and blaming the others for trying to frame him and scare him away. He declares he has decided to stay. Ann tells Willet how her husband changes personalities more and more since the first night he arrived. Inside, Joseph declares that Charles is dead and he now has full control. But before he does his work, he must get his revenge against the descendants of the ones who burned him alive.At the bar, Weeden talks about the grave robbery and tries to stir the townspeople into fighting back against Ward, saying if they do nothing to save themselves they deserve whatever they get. Meanwhile, the possessed Ward unbolts the door to Weeden's locked attic, releasing the creature. Weeden returns home to be attacked by the thing, and both die when they fall into the fireplace. Ward tears the name Ezra Weeden off his revenge list. Peter Smith is appalled when Ward later attends Weeden's funeral from a distance.Night falls, and while Peter Smith is out walking alone, Ward tosses gasoline on him and sets him on fire. Micah Smith's name is removed from the list. Simon warns him to stop feasting on revenge, but Curwan insists on continuing his task. He goes to make love to Ann, but she scratches him and makes him leave. She then summons Dr. Willet for help, telling him Joseph Curwan is killing her husband. Ward arrives suddenly in mid-conversation and tells the doctor the house is affecting his wife. He pretends he is unchanged, asking the doctor to take her to Boston. She reluctantly agrees, and leaves at once with the doctor. As they pass through the town, the townspeople show Willet and Ann the burned body of Smith and declare that her husband killed him. Willet decides they must get Ward out of the palace before the townspeople kill him.Alone with Simon and Jabez, Charles succeeds in bringing Hester completely back from the dead. Ann and Willet go back to the palace but can't find Ward. Willet remembers how Ward just appeared when they were talking by the picture. They look at the nearby wall and find the secret door to the cellar. In the cellar, they find the empty coffin of Hester and the Necronomicon. Charles, Simon, Hester and Jabez confront them. Joseph tells of a project - the most important ever attempted by humans - that they were working on ""a few years ago"". They don't fully understand it, they just obey. Simon takes Willet away while Ann is chained to the posts. Ward chants in Latin. Jabez tell Willet they are ""honoring"" her. The grate below the posts is opened, and an unearthly creature begins to rise from the depths below.The townspeople charge to the palace and open the door calling for Joseph Curwan and setting the place on fire. They toss the portrait of Curwan in the fire. When they do, Ward is freed of Joseph's possession. He runs to his wife and unchains her before the creature arrives. Simeon and Jabez attack him, calling him a traitor. He pleads for Willet to take Ann to safety. The doctor gets her outside safely and then goes back for Charles. He finds him alone and collapsed in the cellar, and barely manages to get him out the front door before the flames consume the palace. Leaning against a tree, Ward tells them he is all right now, thanks to Ann and Dr. Willet and that he looks forward to repaying their kindness. But the sinister tone of his voice and the half smile on his face as he turns back around indicate that he is once again possessed by Joseph.","

    Synopsis
    In this chilling adaptation of H.P. Lovecrafts The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward, Charles Dexter Ward (Vincent Price) travels with his wife Ann (Debra Paget) to Arkham to inspect a mansion he has inherited. The original lord of the manor was his Great Grandfather Joseph Curwen, a disciple of the devil, who placed a hideous curse on the villagers as they burned him at the stake. Slowly Ward feels the spirit of his ancestor possessing him and seeking a desperate vengeance on the descendants of those who previously thwarted his plans. Accursed mutants...evil possession...will anyone escape The Haunted Palace?In the town of Arkham, in 18th century New England, Ezra Weeden (Leo Gordon) and Micah Smith (Elisha Cook Jr.) follow a young woman named Fitch at a distance. She seems to be in a trance as she walks through a cemetery to a palace door where she knocks and is ushered in by a woman named Hester. Declaring this is the home of Satan himself, Ezra and Micah go to get help. Meanwhile, Hester takes the Fitch woman to Joseph Curwan (Vincent Price), who leads her through a secret door downstairs to a platform in an ancient dungeon cellar. He chains her between two posts on the platform and then he chants in Latin. The woman finally awakes screaming at the sound of some beast growling from below.The townspeople armed with torches arrive at the palace door and knock. Curwan opens it and produces the Fitch girl alive and well, but still in a trance. She answers yes to his claims that she came of her own free will, but when asked by Weeden for her name she cannot answer. The townspeople accuse Curwan of being a warlock and tie him to a tree. He calls out their names: Ezra Weeden, Micah Smith, Benjamin West, Priam Willet (Frank Maxwell), and Gideon Leach.

                    Conrad Birdie, arguably the biggest rock and roll superstar in the world, has just been drafted, which brings his legion of teen-aged female fans marching in the streets in protest. One other person not happy about Birdie being drafted is struggling songwriter Albert F. Peterson, a mama's boy of a man who was finally going to hit the big time when one of his songs was to be featured in a Birdie movie. Rosie DeLeon, Albert's long suffering secretary and fiancée of six years, pitches an idea to Ed Sullivan: have Birdie appear on his television program, Toast of the Town (1948) kissing one of his fans as a symbolic goodbye to all his fans, while he sings a yet to be written song by Albert to be called ""One Last Kiss"". Sullivan buys the idea. Rosie is hoping that this move will bring financial security to Albert, who will then be able to support his mama, ex-vaudevillian Mae Peterson who wanted Albert to go into show business instead of his want to become a bio-chemist, and marry her (of course if Mama allows the marriage, she who doesn't even know they're engaged). The fan chosen is Kim McAfee of Sweet Apple, Ohio. Up until being chosen as the recipient of Birdie's kiss, Kim's sole focus in life was being pinned by her boyfriend, Hugo Peabody. Birdie's presence in Sweet Apple brings up many issues which may thwart Rosie and Albert's plans, including a jealous Hugo, an exasperated Harry McAfee (Kim's father), and a ballooning line-up on the show, all these problems which Rosie and Albert try to manage. The ultimate problem may be outside of Rosie and Albert's control, except for a little assistance of some bio-chemistry hopefully to solve the problem. Regardless, Rosie, in the end, may only be able to take so much of Albert siding with Mama instead of her.

As it was such a beautiful sight, most people were watching, and as a consequence, 99% of the population go blind. In the original novel, this chaos results in the escape of some Triffids: experimental plants that are capable of moving themselves around and attacking people.

The caller soon identified himself as Frank, her ex-pimp who has recently escaped from prison. Rosy is terrified for it was her testimony that landed the man in jail. Looking for solace, Rosy phones her lesbian lover Mary (Lynda Alfonsi). The two women have been estranged for some time, but Rosy is certain that she is the only one who can help her. Mary agrees to come over that night. Seconds later, Frank calls again, promising that no matter who she calls for protection, he will have his revenge. Unknown to Rosy, Mary is the caller impersonating Frank. Marry arrives at Rosy's apartment soon after, and does her best to calm Rosy's nerves. She gives the panic-struck woman a tranquillizer and puts her to bed.Later that night as Rosy sleeps, Mary gets up out of bed, and pens a note of confession: she was the one making the strange phone calls when she learned of Franks escape from prison. Knowing that Rosy would call on her for help, she explains that she felt it was her way of coming back into her life after their breakup. While she is busy writing, she fails to notice an intruder in the apartment. This time it is Frank, for real. He creeps up behind Mary and strangles her to death with one of Rosys nylon stockings. The sound of the struggle awaken Rosy and she gasps in fright. The murderous pimp realizes that he just killed the wrong woman, and slowly makes his way to Rosy's bed. However, earlier that night, Rosy had placed a butcher knife under her pillow at Mary's suggestion. Rosy seizes the knife and stabs Frank with it as he's beginning to strangle her. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria, surrounded by the two corpses of her former lovers.THE WURDALAKIn 19th Century Russia, Vladimir D'Urfe is a young nobleman on a long trip. During the course of his journey, he finds a beheaded corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He withdraws the blade and takes it as a souvenir.Later that night, Vladimir stops at a small rural cottage to ask for shelter. He notices several daggers hanging up on one of the walls, and a vacant space that happens to fit the one he has discovered. Vladimir is surprised by the entrance of Giorgio (Glauco Onorato), who explains that the knife belongs to his father, who has not been seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to the young count, and subsequently introduces him to the rest of the family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Anderson). It subsequently transpires that they are eagerly anticipating the arrival of their father, Gorcha, as well as the reason for his absence: he has gone to do battle with the outlaw and dreaded wurdalak Ali Beg. Vladimir is confused by the term, and Sdenka explains that a wurdalak is a walking cadaver who feeds on the blood of the living, preferably close friends and family members. Giorgio and Pietro are certain that the corpse Vladimir had discovered is that of Ali Beg, but also realize that there is a strong possibility that their father has been infected by the blood curse too. They warn the count to leave, but he decides to stay and await the old mans return.At the stroke of midnight, Gorcha (Boris Karloff) returns to the cottage. His sour demeanor and unkempt appearance bode the worse, and the two brothers are torn: they realize that it is their duty to kill Gorcha before he feeds on the family, but their love for him makes it difficult to reach a decision. Later that night, both Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorcha who drains them of blood, and then flees the cottage. Giorgio stakes and beheads Pietro to prevent him from reviving as a wurdalak. But he is prevented from doing so to Ivan when his wife threatens to commit suicide. Reluntantly, he agrees to bury the child without taking the necessary precautions.That same night, the child rises from his grave and begs to be invited into the cottage. The mother runs to her son's aid, stabbing Giorgio when he attempts to stop her, only to be greeted at the front door by Gorcha. The old man bits and infects his daughter-in-law, who then does the same for her husband. Vladimir and Sdenka flee from the cottage and go on the run and hide out in the ruins of an abandoned cathedral as dawn breaks. Vladimir is optimistic that a long and happy life lies with them. But Sdenka is reluctant to relinquish her family ties. She believes that she is meant to stay with the family.Sdenka's fears about her family are confirmed when that evening, Gorcha and her siblings show up at the abandoned Abby. As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka is lured into their loving arms where they bite to death. Awakened by her screams, Vladimir rushes to her aid, but the family has already taken her home, forcing the lover to follow suite. The young nobleman finds her, lying motionless on her bed. Sdenka awakens, and a distinct change is visible on her face. No longer caring, Vladimir embraces her, and she bites and infects him too.THE DROP OF WATERIn Victorian London, England, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) is called to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dressed the body, she notices an elaborate diamond ring on its finger. Tempted by greed, Nurse Chester steals it. As she does, a glass tips over, and drops of water begin to splash on the floor. She is also assailed by a fly, no doubt attracted by the odor of the body. Unsettled but pleased by her acquisition, she finishes the job and returns home to her small East End flat.After returning home, Nurse Chester is assailed by strange events. The buzzing fly returns and continues to pester her. Then the lights in her apartment go out, and the sounds of the dripping water continues with maddening regularity. She sees the old womans corpse lying on her bed, and coming towards her. The terrified woman begs for forgiveness, but she ultimately strangles herself, imaging that the medium's hands are gripping her throat.The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Nurse Chester's body and calls the police. The investigator on the scene (Gustavo de Nardo) quickly concludes that its a simple case and that Nurse Chester ""died of fright"". The pathologist arrives on the scene to examine the body before it's taken away and he notes that the only sign of violence is a small bruise on her left finger, mostly likely caused when someone pried a ring from her finger. As the doctor makes this observation, the concierge appears distressed, as she has apparently took the ring from the dead Nurse Chester, and is further distracted by the sound of a fly swooping about in the air....Boris Karloff makes a final appearance as Gorcha riding on his horse as he concludes the three tales of fear and tells the viewers to be careful while walking home at night for ghosts and vampires have no fear. The image pulls back to actually reveal him sitting on a prop fake horse with a camera crew and various crewmen moving branches around to simulate the scene of riding through the forest from the Wurdalak segment.","

"27","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057163/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Hud opens on a wide open Texas landscape, which turns to a highway while spare and lovely guitar music plays. We then meet Lon (Brandon De Wilde) an impressionable teenager catching a ride into town to retrieve his Uncle Hud. The driver lets him out and asks how he'll look for Hud and Lon explains he just has to find Hud's pink Cadillac.Seeing a bartender sweeping up window glass from the sidewalk, Lon asks what the trouble was, the bar owner explains his trouble was Hud being there the last night.Lon soon finds the Cadillac outside a local married couple's house. Honking on the Cadillac's horn, he manages to get Hud to come out, although Hud is clearly angry about being disturbed as he was in bed with the wife and isn't quite dressed. Lon explains that Hud's father Homer (Melvyn Douglas) needs him right away. Ready to leave he peeks in the door and says ""Thank you honey."" Lon and Hud are both surprised when the woman's husband, Joe, pulls up to see them leaving. He asks which of them is leaving his house at 6 in the morning. Hud claims that he found Lon there and came to take him home. Joe threatens Lon, but Hud reminds him of his diabetes, and promises to ""cool his temperature.""Driving away, Lon's upset, but Hud tells him ""Relax, you could charge a stud fee by the time that story gets around town."" Hud asks what Homer wants and Lon says he needs advice on something. Hud is surprised as Homer hasn't asked for advice in fifteen years. Hud speeds home and parks in a flower bed which Alma (Patricia Neal) the Bannon's live in housekeeper, isn't pleased about, remarking that he does it every time.Homer brings Hud and Lon out to see one a heffer who has died of unknown causes with no signs. Alma asks him why he parks on her flowers and Hud tells her ""Don't plant them where I park."" She offers him some eggs asking if he had breakfast in bed. Hud tells her, ""Nope hadn't gotten around to breakfast."" which makes Alma grin as Hud leaves. Homer has hands watching the corpse to keep the vultures away. Reaching the site, Hud starts shooting at the vultures, prompting Homer to scold him, saying ""Don't do that, Hud; they help keep the country clean. Besides, it's against the law."" Hud tells him ""Well, I've always thought the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner. Sometimes I lean one way and sometimes I lean the other.""Hud has no idea what killed it and Homer mentions wanting to call in the state vet to check it out. Hud has a problem with that and tells Homer the government shouldn't have any business on their land. Homer appears decided however, and tells Hud and Lon to stay with the steer and wait so the ranch hands can take a break. After a few minutes, Hud gets bored and takes a nearby horse back to his car, leaving Lon to do the watching. Soon after getting his car Hud finds Alma with one of the ranch hands on the side of the road with a blown tire. He leaves the hand to fix it and takes Alma back home as she has groceries to get back before dinner. She teases Hud about the smell of Chanel #5 in the car saying ""You sure weren't riding the range this afternoon, were ya?"" Hud responds ""I sure wasn't."" Alma tells him she doesn't know how some women have the time for Hud in the middle of the day. He tells her ""They just drop everything honey."" and she tells him ""I suppose it does beat housework."" Alma also tells him that a checker at the grocery store told her that Hud is seeing Truman Peter's wife.Homer and Lon eat dinner with Alma serving them, and then go sit on the porch to wait for desert. Hud, meanwhile yells at Alma to bring him a shirt. Hud flirts with her when she brings it to his room although she rebuffs his comments. Lon talks with Homer on the porch. When Homer asks what he's thinking about, Lon tells him, the future, having a car, and girls. Homer tells him ""You'll get your share of what's good. A boy like you deserves it."" Lon takes a look at a fading picture of his deceased father, Homer's son, from Homer's wallet. Lon asks him if he doesn't carry a picture of Hud in his wallet. Homer says ""No, I don't"" Lon says Lon: But he's your son, same as my Dad was.Homer: Yeah, he is.Lon: What are you holding against him Granddad?Homer: He knows and you don't need to.Alma brings them desert and sits on the porch with them. Hud comes outside ready to leave and Homer asks him to try and be home for the vet in the morning. Hud asks ALma to get a drink with him, but she declines, although he flirts with her about it. Lon asks Hud if he can go along and Hud agrees to take him into town. Homer tells Lon to be careful and glares at Hud, who tells Lon to drive. Lon asks ""What was that all about?"" and Hud says ""It's a story I'll tell you one day when I'm drunk.""In town, Lon tries to get a drink with Hud but Hud tells him to get a Dr. Pepper instead. Lon heads to the corner store and looks through paperback book rentals, then catches up with Hud, who now has beer. Hud gives Lon a hard time for following him and reveals he's on his way to ""Mrs. Ruben Fletcher's house."" Lon protests Hud treating like a kid and and Hud asks ""How old are ya, Fantan, a fast 17?"" Hud tells him ""When I was your age, I couldn't get enough of anything."" He tells Lon that's the year he was born and tells him about going out with his father, adding ""Boy, we dossie-doed and chased a lot of girlish butts around that summer."" Lon is fascinated at the talk and tells Hud ""I wouldn't mind going that route myself."" prompting Hud to tell him to come along, although Lon declines.Alma comes into Lonnie's room to wake him the next day. She asks him ""Are you sleeping in the raw again?"" to avoid pulling the sheet off of him. He says he is, and asks Alma what she sleeps in. SHe tells him ""In my own room with the door locked."" He asks ""Do you ever wear any of those little shorty things.""Alma: What kind of question is that?Lon: Just wondered.Alma: Does your mind usually run that direction?Lon: Yeah, it seems to.Alma: Boys with impure thoughts come out in acne.Lon: Oh, that's all bull Alma.Alma: Keep it up, you'll see.SHe tickles him to make him jump before leaving the room.Homer and Hud are out at the dead heifer, meeting with the vet, who tells Homer to get all of the cattle together for inspection. Homer asks why and the vet explains ""I hope I'm wrong, but I'm afraid you've got the very worst kind of trouble a cattleman can have. I think that cow died of foot and mouth disease."" Homer is surprised. Homer realizes that the vet may have to kill every animal he owns to prevent outbreak. After the vet leaves Hud remarks, ""You gonna let them shoot your cows out from underneath you on account of a schoolbook disease? You getting that old Homer?"" Homer: I wonder if a long quarantine wouldn't satisfy them? You think they'd agree to that?Hud: They don't have to agree to nothing. They're the LAW. You can agree with 'em 'til Hell freezes over for all the good it'll do ya.Hud proposes that Homer sell all the cattle before the inspector comes back.Homer: Would that be your way of getting out of a tight? Hud: Ship the whole herd out before they begin the tests!Homer: You mean, try and pass bad stuff off on to my neighbors who wouldn't even know what they was getting? Hud: You don't know it's bad stuff. I'd ship 'em out of state. Load them up north before the news gets out.Homer: And take a chance on starting an epidemic in the entire country? Hud: Why, this whole country is run on epidemics, where you been? Epidemics are big business, price fixing, crooked TV shows, income tax finagling, souped up expense accounts. How many honest men you know? You take the sinners away from the saints, you're lucky to end up with Abraham Lincoln. Now I say let us put our bread into some of that gravy while it is still hot. Homer: You're an unprincipled man Hud. Hud: Don't let that flush ya. I mean, you got enough for both of us.While the cattle are rounded up, Hud notices Homer is having a tough time. He suggests Homer go take a nap but Homer insists ""I'll hold up my end of it."" Lon comes out to help with the round up. Lon talks about the rarity of a couple longhorn steer that Homer keeps for nostalgic reasons, and suggests they turn them loose. Homer insists that they have to go with the rest. Homer and Lon go out to see a movie and Homer keeps dozing off. After the movie they go to a diner for desert and Hud happens to walk in with Mrs. Peters. Homer asks Lon if he's with Truman Peters' wife. Lon says yes and offers to call Hud over, but Homer tells him to leave him alone. Hud walks over with her anyway, introducing Mrs. Peters to Homer, who shakes her hand and then looks at his plate. Hud points out that Homer hasn't asked them to sit down, explaining that her being married offends Homer's ""high priciples and what have you."" WHile Hud is talking Homer suddenly slumps and looks ill. Hud and Lon get him to the car right away to go home. Lon reasons that he must have got too much sun. Homer falls asleep and Hud and Lon talk.Lon: I forget how old he is. I just don't want to think about it.Hud: It's time you started.Lon: I know he's gonna die someday. I know that much.Hud: He is.Lon: Makes me feel like somebody dumped me into a cold river.Hud: Happens to everybody, horses, dogs, men. Nobody gets out of life alive.Lon helps Homer into the house and Hud sees Alma come home. He goes to her room to visit her, looking through items she's won in contests to make conversation. He tells her ""You're a good housekeeper, a good cook. You're a good laundress. What else you good at? [sitting down and leaning on her bed]Alma: [sitting on the other side of the bed] Taking care of myself.Hud: Shouldn't have to, a woman that looks like you do.Alma: That's what my ex husband used to tell me before he took my wallet, my gasoline credit card and left me stranded in a downtown hotel in Albequerque New Mexico.Hud: What'd you do to make him take to the hills, wear your curlers to bed?Alma: Ed's a gambler. He's probably up at Vegas arena right now, dealing at night, losing it all back in the daytime.Hud: A man like that sounds no better than a heel.Alma: Aren't you all?Hud: Hony, don't go shooting all the dogs because one of em's got fleas.Alma: I was married to Ed for six years. The only thing he was eve good for was to scratch my back where I couldn't reach it.Hud: You still got that itch?Alma: Off and on.Hud: Well, let me know when it gets to bothering ya. Alma smiles and Hud makes his exit.The next day the vet starts injecting fresh cows with specimens taken from Homer's herd. From there they have to wait 6 days to look for symptoms to develop. Lon ends up getting kicked in the head by one of the cows, passing out when he tries to get back to work. Hud carries him to the house and puts him in bed. Alma suggests they call a doctor but Hud insists they don't need one. She checks on him in bed and he tells Alma how beautiful she is. She encourages him to go to sleep. The cattle are penned in for quarantine and signs put up around the property. Lon wakes up the next day ready to work, but Homer tells him there isn't anything to do until the quarantine is over. Hud takes exception, telling Homer they're just letting the government throw dirt in their faces. He mockingly refers to the family as ""poor but honest.""Hud asks Alma where his Jack Daniels is, although he already looks drunk. She tells him he already drank it. He comes up behind her and nuzzles her neck. She tells him she ""doesn't like sudden passes."" He warns here that ""there's another one coming up on your right."" before moving to the other side of her neck. She says ""Don't you ever ask?"" Hud says ""The only question I ever ask any woman is 'What time is your husband coming home?'"" He suggests they ""get their shoelaces untied."" ALma says she's ""been asked with a little more finesse."" She doesn't tell him to stop, but Hud quickly moves away and says ""I wouldn't want to come on crude."" He offers to bring her some perfume and she adds a few items to the list, including colored beads and wampum. Hud says ""Whatever it takes to make you trade."" Alma replies ""No thanks. I've done my time with one cold blooded bastard. I'm not looking for another."" Hud replies, ""It's too late honey. You already found him.""The next morning Hud invites everyone to watch him at the ""pig scramble."" making a dig at Alma in the prcess saying ""They're letting ladies in free. You might just qualify."" She doesn't answer the remark but Lon tells Homer it's the first time Hud's ever asked him to go anywhere and he wonders why. Homer says ""Lonesome I imagine, just trying to scare up a little company.""Lon: Hud, lonesome? He can get more women coming in than anyone else around.Homer: That ain't necessarily much. It ain't necessarily company neither. Women just like to be around something dangerous part of the time. Even Hud can get lonesome once in a while. Alma listens to the conversation silently while washing dishes, but when Homer and Lon decide to go, she says ""I'll stay home. I don't like pigs.""At the pig scramble, Hud joins a contest to catch greased pigs and wins. Afterwards Hud invites Lon and Homer to go out with him. Homer declines but Lon takes him up on it. Hud offers to buy Lon a drink. The two sit in a diner together and Hud offers to spike Lon's drink with whiskey, which he eagerly agrees to even encouraging Hud not to be sparing about it. Lon notices an attractive woman. Hud encourages him to approach her, but Lon says he wouldn't make a move at her. Hud asks ""Well why not? You ain't nailed down, are ya?"" He encourages him more saying ""Get all the good you can out of 17 because it sure wears out in one hell of a hurry."" Lon: My trouble is I need to like a girl a lot before I can work up to anything. I mean like her as a person."" Hud: Honcho, you're a regular idealist.Lon: What's wrong with that?Hud: I don't know. I just ain't never tried it. Lon: I suppose you think I'm a jerk. Hud: WHat do you care what i think?Lon: This is probably gonna hand you a big laugh... but I do.Hud: Then have another little drink, and I'll have another little drink. Then maybe we can work up some real family feeling here.Lon gets up to put change in the jukebox, and while he's doing that he makes a point of looking at the lady they were admiring. This isn't appreciated by her boyfriend, who starts threatening him. Hud gets involved and ends up sucker punching the man. Both Lon and Hud end up getting into it and get the bar into an uproar. The two head home afterwards and Hud tells Lon it felt like old times mentioning Lon's dad. Hud tells Lon ""When you ain't bein' a pain in the tail, you remind me a lot of him."" Hud starts talking about Norman (Lon's dad) remembering an episode where they got drunk and Norman convinced him that he could hear the grass grow. He tells Lon that was the night he crashed a car, killing Norman and walking away without a scratch himself. Hud expects the story will change Lon's opinion of him, but it doesn't. The two of them walk into the house singing loudly. Homer hears them and can tell they're drunk. He asks Lon ""What else has he give you a taste for?"" Homer tells Hud he doesn't have a problem with Lon having a drink, but Hud Hud asks what's bothering him.Homer: You, Hud. Like always.Lon: Hey, waht are you climbing on Hud foor?Homer: Yo think a lot of Hud, do ya? You think he's a real man. Well, you're being took in. Hud: You listen to him honcho. He's my daddy and he knows...Homer: I know ya. You're smart. You got your share of guts. You can talk a man into trusting ya, and a woman into wanting ya. Hud: I got it made ain't I? Homer: To hear you tell it.Hud: Why don't you get it off your chest. What's been griping ya all this time is what I dne to Norman,Homer: You were drunk and careless of your brother. Hud: You had fifteen years to get over it, that's half of my life. Homer: That's not our quarrel and never has been.Hud: The hell it isn't.Homer: No, boy. I was sick of you a long time before that. Hud: Well, isn't life full of surprises? All along, I thought it was because of what I done to my big brother. Homer: I took that hard, but I buried it. Hud: Well alright I'll bite. What turned you sour on me? Not that I give a damn. Homer: Just that Hud, you don't give a damn. That's all. That's the whole of it. You still don't get it, do ya? You don't care about people Hud. You don't give a damn about em. You got all that charm going for ya and it makes the youngsters want to be like ya. That's the shame of it, because ya don't value nothin'. You don't respect nothin'. You keep no check on your appetites at all. You live just for yourself and that makes ya not fit to live with.Hud: My Momma loved me, but she died.Hud leaves and Lon tells Homer he shouldn't pick on Hud, as everyone around is like him in some way. Homer tells him ""That's no cause for rejoicing. Little by little the look of the country changes because of the men we admire""Lon: I still think you nailed him pretty hard.Homer: Did I? Maybe. Old people get as hard as their arteries. You're just going to have to make up your own mind one day, about what's right and what's wrong.Lon goes to check on Hud who's upset that Alma's asleep when he wants to eat something. Lon offers to cook something but Hud yells at him to leave while he has another drink.The next day Lon is out watching the rodeo. Hud stops by and finds him offering Lon ten dollars to get himself a good seat, and promises there's more money to come. Hud reveals that he's talked with a lawyer who told him ""There's a law that says when old folks can't cut the mustard anymore, you can make them let go, whether they like it or not."" Lon is disgusted with the idea and tries to return the ten dollars. Hud tries to explain that he just wants what he's worked for for years and says ""You don't look out for yourself, the only helping hand you'll ever get is when they lower the box."" Later on, Hud sits in his room drinking and watching TV. Homer comes in and confronts him about Lon has told him.Hud is proud to tell Homer that when the cattle situation is over, whatever happens ""you better get yourself a rocking chair and get out of my way."" Homer tells him there's no way he can get control of the property while he's above ground. Homer admits he might have made some mistakes and been too hard on Hud. Hud tells him ""You ain't never been wrong."" painting Homer as uncompromising and holier than thou, and the concluding ""So I just naturally had to go bad in the face of so much good."" Homer wonders how a man like Hud can be his son and leaves the room. Hud follows him yelling ""You've got the same feeling beneath your belt as any other man, that's how you got stuck with me for a son."" Lon hears the yelling and comes out of his room but Hud runs past him and heads to Alma's room when he sees her outside. SHe sees he's in rare form and runs inside, locking the door as fast as she can, but Hud kicks the door open and grabs her and starts kissing her forcibly, escalating as she struggles, meaning to rape her. Lon interrupts before that happens. Hud easily bests him, but can't bring hiself to punch Lon, so leaves instead.The next day the vet tells them that it is foot and mouth disease which means all of the animals have to be killed and quickly. The vet tries to cheer up Homer telling him he might sell some oil leases anyway. Hud speaks up about it saying ""My Daddy thinks that oil is something you stick in your salad dressing."" Homer says ""If there's oil down there, you can get it sucked up after I'm under there with it. But, I don't like it and I don't aim to have it. There'll be no holes punched in this land while I'm here. They ain't gonna come in here and grade no road so the wind can blow me away. What's oil to me? What can I do with a bunch of rotten oil wells? I can't ride out every day and prowl amongst 'em like I can my cattle. I can't breed 'em or tend 'em or rope 'em or chase 'em or nothing. I can't feel a smidgen of pride in 'em 'cause they ain't none of my doing. Hud says ""There's money in it."" Homer answers ""I don't want that kind of money. I want mine to come from something that keeps a man doing for himself.""They then have a big pit dug to herd the cattle into. Homer gets all of the help together with guns and they shoot all the cattle from above until they're all dead while Homer forces himself to oversee it. Lon remarks ""That didn't take long."" And Homer says ""It doesn't take long to kill things, not like it does to grow."" Bulldozers start filling in the hole with dirt. Homer still has his two Longhorn steer and is watching them and one of the government guys notices them as well and moves to enter their pen. Homer tells him he's going to kill them himself, but the man says ""There's no guarantee that you'll do it."" The vet hears the argument and calls the man off, willing to take Homer's word. He apologizes to Homer who remarks ""He ain't such a bad fella, just got a cruddy job."" Homer next lets all of his ranch hands go and asks for his rifle. He tells Lon ""I've chased them Longhorns many a mile. I don't know if I can kill 'em, but I guess I can."" He tells Lon to go somewhere else and shoots them both, needing a couple shots for each. Hud listens a little ways away and tells Lon ""Them old bulls are hard to kill.""Alma is packing her things to leave. Lon gives her a ride to the bus station and tries to talk her into staying. She tells him to take care of his grandfather and not to be lazy and gives him a hug. Hud happens to be passing the bus stop and sees her there. He apologizes saying ""Looks like we're losing a good cook. Maybe we should've boosted your salary a little. You ain't letting that little ruckus we had run you off?""Alma: As far as I can get on a bus ticket.Hud: You telling me i'm the first guy who ever stuck his foot in your door?Alma: No.Hud: First one who ever got rough huh? Well, I'm sorry. It ain't my style. I don't usually get rough with my women. I generally don't have to. Alma: You're rough on everybody.Hud: So they tell me.Alma: You want to know something funny? It would've happened eventually without the roughhouse. You look pretty good without your shirt on you know. The sight of that through the kitchen window made me put down my dish towel more than once. Hud: Why didn't you speak up sooner?The bus pulls up and Alma gets on. Hud calls after her :I'll remember you honey. You're the one that got away.The bus takes off. Lon is driving home in the dark and Hud comes up speeding behind him. Hud bumps into Lon's car to nudge him. Lon sees Homer crawling across the road and slams his brakes sending his car off the road. Hud doesn't know what happened and yells at Lon telling him he'll be paying to fix the car for a long time. Lon tells him he saw Homer in the road and Hud rushes out to check.Homer is still conscious and tells them he fell off his horse. Hud tells Lon to take his car and go call for an ambulance, but when the car won't start Hud tells him to bring the whiskey. Homer tells them he feels like giving up. He tells Hud ""They're waiting on me. And he ain't a patient man."" Hud tells Lon that Homer's gone. Hud tells Lon that ""he couldn't have made it another hour, any way in the world."" Lon answers ""He could've if he'd wanted to. You fixed it so he didn't want to anymore.""Hud: You don't know the whole story. Yeah, him and me fought many and many a round together, but I guess you could say that I helped him about as much as he ever helped me.Lon: How did you help him Hud? By trying to sell him out? By taking the heart out of him? By making him give up and quit? Is that how you helped him?We next see Lon and Hud at Homer's funeral service. One of the mourners tells Lon ""Look at it this way, he's gone to a better place."" Lon says ""I don't think so. Not unless dirt is a better place than air."" Lon walks away. We then see Hud pulling into their property with his car still damaged. He sees lon walking around and tells him they buried Homer. Lon is carrying his things and Hud asks him where he's going.Lon tells Hud he's going somewhere else to work for awhile. Hud expresses concern that Lon's too green to make it on his own. He tells Lon a story about his grandfather giving him a Mars bar when he joined the army and telling him, ""Character's the only thing I got to give you. Be a man."" Lon answers ""Well I guess he was kind of worried, your trying so hard to get out of the draft and all."" Hud tells Lon that if he isn't succesful he can come back and work for him, but Lon says he won't be back. Hud tells him "" I guess you've come to be of your Granddaddy's opinion that I ain't fit to live with. That's too bad. Yeah, we mightta whooped it up some, you and me. That's the way you used to want it.""Lon: I useta. So long, Hud.Lon starts walking again and Hud yells after him ""You know something Fantan? This world's so fulla crap, a man's gonna get into it sooner or later whether he's careful or not.""Hud walks into the empty house and gets a drink. He lights a cigarette, looking out the open door in thought. He then waves and closes the door behind him as he goes back in the house.","
    
                    Hud Bannon is a ruthless young man who tarnishes everything and everyone he touches. Hud represents the perfect embodiment of alienated youth, out for kicks with no regard for the consequences. There is bitter conflict between the callous Hud and his stern and highly principled father, Homer. Hud's nephew Lon admires Hud's cheating ways, though he soon becomes aware of Hud's reckless amorality to bear him anymore. In the world of the takers and the taken, Hud is a winner. He's a cheat, but, he explains ""I always say the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner.""

                    Homer Bannon is an honest, hard-working, by-the-book Texas rancher. His son, Hud, is quite the opposite - amoral, unscrupulous and tending to prefer chasing married women around, rather than working on the ranch. The two are in constant conflict. Stuck between the two are Lonnie, Hud's nephew, and Alma, the Bannon's live-in housekeeper. Lonnie is a naive, impressionable young man who simultaneously idolises Hud and despises some of the things he does. Alma is constantly positive, is happy to overlook Hud's antagonism and tries to stay out of the fights. What happened to Lonnie's father, Hud's brother, hangs over the family, but nobody dares speak about it. The feud between Hud and his father comes to a head when a possible epidemic strikes their cattle herd.

                    Thirty-four year old Hud Bannon comes from a Texas cattle ranching family. Unlike his aging father, Homer Bannon, whose entire life has always been the ranch, self-absorbed and reckless Hud sees the ranch and ranching solely as a means to live his hard and fast life, which includes copious amounts of alcohol and cavorting with loose women, regardless of their marital status. Also living in the house of the ranch is Homer's seventeen year old grandson, Lonnie Bannon, whose father Norman Bannon, Hud's older brother and Homer's other son, died when Lonnie was two. Beyond the open differences in their wants in life, there is a further underlying tension between Homer and Hud. Lonnie, however, admires Hud, Lonnie who believes his grandfather rides Hud too much. A recent arrival into the household is the new housekeeper, middle aged divorcée Alma Brown. She is well aware that both Hud and Lonnie are attracted to her, each in his own way. A crisis on the ranch and the actions of the three Bannon men to the crisis have the potential to clarify the interrelationships between all four living in the Bannon house.

    Synopsis
    Hud opens on a wide open Texas landscape, which turns to a highway while spare and lovely guitar music plays. We then meet Lon (Brandon De Wilde) an impressionable teenager catching a ride into town to retrieve his Uncle Hud. The driver lets him out and asks how he'll look for Hud and Lon explains he just has to find Hud's pink Cadillac.Seeing a bartender sweeping up window glass from the sidewalk, Lon asks what the trouble was, the bar owner explains his trouble was Hud being there the last night.Lon soon finds the Cadillac outside a local married couple's house. Honking on the Cadillac's horn, he manages to get Hud to come out, although Hud is clearly angry about being disturbed as he was in bed with the wife and isn't quite dressed. Lon explains that Hud's father Homer (Melvyn Douglas) needs him right away. Ready to leave he peeks in the door and says ""Thank you honey."" Lon and Hud are both surprised when the woman's husband, Joe, pulls up to see them leaving. He asks which of them is leaving his house at 6 in the morning. Hud claims that he found Lon there and came to take him home. Joe threatens Lon, but Hud reminds him of his diabetes, and promises to ""cool his temperature.""Driving away, Lon's upset, but Hud tells him ""Relax, you could charge a stud fee by the time that story gets around town."" Hud asks what Homer wants and Lon says he needs advice on something. Hud is surprised as Homer hasn't asked for advice in fifteen years. Hud speeds home and parks in a flower bed which Alma (Patricia Neal) the Bannon's live in housekeeper, isn't pleased about, remarking that he does it every time.Homer brings Hud and Lon out to see one a heffer who has died of unknown causes with no signs. Alma asks him why he parks on her flowers and Hud tells her ""Don't plant them where I park."" She offers him some eggs asking if he had breakfast in bed. Hud tells her, ""Nope hadn't gotten around to breakfast."" which makes Alma grin as Hud leaves. Homer has hands watching the corpse to keep the vultures away. Reaching the site, Hud starts shooting at the vultures, prompting Homer to scold him, saying ""Don't do that, Hud; they help keep the country clean. Besides, it's against the law."" Hud tells him ""Well, I've always thought the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner. Sometimes I lean one way and sometimes I lean the other.""Hud has no idea what killed it and Homer mentions wanting to call in the state vet to check it out. Hud has a problem with that and tells Homer the government shouldn't have any business on their land. Homer appears decided however, and tells Hud and Lon to stay with the steer and wait so the ranch hands can take a break. After a few minutes, Hud gets bored and takes a nearby horse back to his car, leaving Lon to do the watching. Soon after getting his car Hud finds Alma with one of the ranch hands on the side of the road with a blown tire. He leaves the hand to fix it and takes Alma back home as she has groceries to get back before dinner. She teases Hud about the smell of Chanel #5 in the car saying ""You sure weren't riding the range this afternoon, were ya?"" Hud responds ""I sure wasn't."" Alma tells him she doesn't know how some women have the time for Hud in the middle of the day. He tells her ""They just drop everything honey."" and she tells him ""I suppose it does beat housework."" Alma also tells him that a checker at the grocery store told her that Hud is seeing Truman Peter's wife.Homer and Lon eat dinner with Alma serving them, and then go sit on the porch to wait for desert. Hud, meanwhile yells at Alma to bring him a shirt. Hud flirts with her when she brings it to his room although she rebuffs his comments. Lon talks with Homer on the porch. When Homer asks what he's thinking about, Lon tells him, the future, having a car, and girls. Homer tells him ""You'll get your share of what's good. A boy like you deserves it."" Lon takes a look at a fading picture of his deceased father, Homer's son, from Homer's wallet. Lon asks him if he doesn't carry a picture of Hud in his wallet. Homer says ""No, I don't"" Lon says Lon: But he's your son, same as my Dad was.
Homer: Yeah, he is.
Lon: What are you holding against him Granddad?
Homer: He knows and you don't need to.
Alma brings them desert and sits on the porch with them. Hud comes outside ready to leave and Homer asks him to try and be home for the vet in the morning. Hud asks ALma to get a drink with him, but she declines, although he flirts with her about it. Lon asks Hud if he can go along and Hud agrees to take him into town. Homer tells Lon to be careful and glares at Hud, who tells Lon to drive. Lon asks ""What was that all about?"" and Hud says ""It's a story I'll tell you one day when I'm drunk.""In town, Lon tries to get a drink with Hud but Hud tells him to get a Dr. Pepper instead. Lon heads to the corner store and looks through paperback book rentals, then catches up with Hud, who now has beer. Hud gives Lon a hard time for following him and reveals he's on his way to ""Mrs. Ruben Fletcher's house."" Lon protests Hud treating like a kid and and Hud asks ""How old are ya, Fantan, a fast 17?"" Hud tells him ""When I was your age, I couldn't get enough of anything."" He tells Lon that's the year he was born and tells him about going out with his father, adding ""Boy, we dossie-doed and chased a lot of girlish butts around that summer."" Lon is fascinated at the talk and tells Hud ""I wouldn't mind going that route myself."" prompting Hud to tell him to come along, although Lon declines.Alma comes into Lonnie's room to wake him the next day. She asks him ""Are you sleeping in the raw again?"" to avoid pulling the sheet off of him. He says he is, and asks Alma what she sleeps in. SHe tells him ""In my own room with the door locked."" He asks ""Do you ever wear any of those little shorty things.""
Alma: What kind of question is that?
Lon: Just wondered.
Alma: Does your mind usually run that direction?
Lon: Yeah, it seems to.
Alma: Boys with impure thoughts come out in acne.
Lon: Oh, that's all bull Alma.
Alma: Keep it up, you'll see.
SHe tickles him to make him jump before leaving the room.Homer and Hud are out at the dead heifer, meeting with the vet, who tells Homer to get all of the cattle together for inspection. Homer asks why and the vet explains ""I hope I'm wrong, but I'm afraid you've got the very worst kind of trouble a cattleman can have. I think that cow died of foot and mouth disease."" Homer is surprised. Homer realizes that the vet may have to kill every animal he owns to prevent outbreak. After the vet leaves Hud remarks, ""You gonna let them shoot your cows out from underneath you on account of a schoolbook disease? You getting that old Homer?"" Homer: I wonder if a long quarantine wouldn't satisfy them? You think they'd agree to that?
Hud: They don't have to agree to nothing. They're the LAW. You can agree with 'em 'til Hell freezes over for all the good it'll do ya.
Hud proposes that Homer sell all the cattle before the inspector comes back.
Homer: Would that be your way of getting out of a tight? Hud: Ship the whole herd out before they begin the tests!
Homer: You mean, try and pass bad stuff off on to my neighbors who wouldn't even know what they was getting? Hud: You don't know it's bad stuff. I'd ship 'em out of state. Load them up north before the news gets out.
Homer: And take a chance on starting an epidemic in the entire country? Hud: Why, this whole country is run on epidemics, where you been? Epidemics are big business, price fixing, crooked TV shows, income tax finagling, souped up expense accounts. How many honest men you know? You take the sinners away from the saints, you're lucky to end up with Abraham Lincoln. Now I say let us put our bread into some of that gravy while it is still hot. Homer: You're an unprincipled man Hud. Hud: Don't let that flush ya. I mean, you got enough for both of us.While the cattle are rounded up, Hud notices Homer is having a tough time. He suggests Homer go take a nap but Homer insists ""I'll hold up my end of it."" Lon comes out to help with the round up. Lon talks about the rarity of a couple longhorn steer that Homer keeps for nostalgic reasons, and suggests they turn them loose. Homer insists that they have to go with the rest. Homer and Lon go out to see a movie and Homer keeps dozing off. After the movie they go to a diner for desert and Hud happens to walk in with Mrs. Peters. Homer asks Lon if he's with Truman Peters' wife. Lon says yes and offers to call Hud over, but Homer tells him to leave him alone. Hud walks over with her anyway, introducing Mrs. Peters to Homer, who shakes her hand and then looks at his plate. Hud points out that Homer hasn't asked them to sit down, explaining that her being married offends Homer's ""high priciples and what have you."" WHile Hud is talking Homer suddenly slumps and looks ill. Hud and Lon get him to the car right away to go home. Lon reasons that he must have got too much sun. Homer falls asleep and Hud and Lon talk.
Lon: I forget how old he is. I just don't want to think about it.
Hud: It's time you started.
Lon: I know he's gonna die someday. I know that much.
Hud: He is.
Lon: Makes me feel like somebody dumped me into a cold river.
Hud: Happens to everybody, horses, dogs, men. Nobody gets out of life alive.Lon helps Homer into the house and Hud sees Alma come home. He goes to her room to visit her, looking through items she's won in contests to make conversation. He tells her ""You're a good housekeeper, a good cook. You're a good laundress. What else you good at? [sitting down and leaning on her bed]
Alma: [sitting on the other side of the bed] Taking care of myself.
Hud: Shouldn't have to, a woman that looks like you do.
Alma: That's what my ex husband used to tell me before he took my wallet, my gasoline credit card and left me stranded in a downtown hotel in Albequerque New Mexico.
Hud: What'd you do to make him take to the hills, wear your curlers to bed?
Alma: Ed's a gambler. He's probably up at Vegas arena right now, dealing at night, losing it all back in the daytime.
Hud: A man like that sounds no better than a heel.
Alma: Aren't you all?
Hud: Hony, don't go shooting all the dogs because one of em's got fleas.
Alma: I was married to Ed for six years. The only thing he was eve good for was to scratch my back where I couldn't reach it.
Hud: You still got that itch?
Alma: Off and on.
Hud: Well, let me know when it gets to bothering ya. Alma smiles and Hud makes his exit.The next day the vet starts injecting fresh cows with specimens taken from Homer's herd. From there they have to wait 6 days to look for symptoms to develop. Lon ends up getting kicked in the head by one of the cows, passing out when he tries to get back to work. Hud carries him to the house and puts him in bed. Alma suggests they call a doctor but Hud insists they don't need one. She checks on him in bed and he tells Alma how beautiful she is. She encourages him to go to sleep. The cattle are penned in for quarantine and signs put up around the property. Lon wakes up the next day ready to work, but Homer tells him there isn't anything to do until the quarantine is over. Hud takes exception, telling Homer they're just letting the government throw dirt in their faces. He mockingly refers to the family as ""poor but honest.""Hud asks Alma where his Jack Daniels is, although he already looks drunk. She tells him he already drank it. He comes up behind her and nuzzles her neck. She tells him she ""doesn't like sudden passes."" He warns here that ""there's another one coming up on your right."" before moving to the other side of her neck. She says ""Don't you ever ask?"" Hud says ""The only question I ever ask any woman is 'What time is your husband coming home?'"" He suggests they ""get their shoelaces untied."" ALma says she's ""been asked with a little more finesse."" She doesn't tell him to stop, but Hud quickly moves away and says ""I wouldn't want to come on crude."" He offers to bring her some perfume and she adds a few items to the list, including colored beads and wampum. Hud says ""Whatever it takes to make you trade."" Alma replies ""No thanks. I've done my time with one cold blooded bastard. I'm not looking for another."" Hud replies, ""It's too late honey. You already found him.""The next morning Hud invites everyone to watch him at the ""pig scramble."" making a dig at Alma in the prcess saying ""They're letting ladies in free. You might just qualify."" She doesn't answer the remark but Lon tells Homer it's the first time Hud's ever asked him to go anywhere and he wonders why. Homer says ""Lonesome I imagine, just trying to scare up a little company.""
Lon: Hud, lonesome? He can get more women coming in than anyone else around.
Homer: That ain't necessarily much. It ain't necessarily company neither. Women just like to be around something dangerous part of the time. Even Hud can get lonesome once in a while. Alma listens to the conversation silently while washing dishes, but when Homer and Lon decide to go, she says ""I'll stay home. I don't like pigs.""At the pig scramble, Hud joins a contest to catch greased pigs and wins. Afterwards Hud invites Lon and Homer to go out with him. Homer declines but Lon takes him up on it. Hud offers to buy Lon a drink. The two sit in a diner together and Hud offers to spike Lon's drink with whiskey, which he eagerly agrees to even encouraging Hud not to be sparing about it. Lon notices an attractive woman. Hud encourages him to approach her, but Lon says he wouldn't make a move at her. Hud asks ""Well why not? You ain't nailed down, are ya?"" He encourages him more saying ""Get all the good you can out of 17 because it sure wears out in one hell of a hurry."" Lon: My trouble is I need to like a girl a lot before I can work up to anything. I mean like her as a person."" Hud: Honcho, you're a regular idealist.
Lon: What's wrong with that?
Hud: I don't know. I just ain't never tried it. Lon: I suppose you think I'm a jerk. Hud: WHat do you care what i think?
Lon: This is probably gonna hand you a big laugh... but I do.
Hud: Then have another little drink, and I'll have another little drink. Then maybe we can work up some real family feeling here.Lon gets up to put change in the jukebox, and while he's doing that he makes a point of looking at the lady they were admiring. This isn't appreciated by her boyfriend, who starts threatening him. Hud gets involved and ends up sucker punching the man. Both Lon and Hud end up getting into it and get the bar into an uproar. The two head home afterwards and Hud tells Lon it felt like old times mentioning Lon's dad. Hud tells Lon ""When you ain't bein' a pain in the tail, you remind me a lot of him."" Hud starts talking about Norman (Lon's dad) remembering an episode where they got drunk and Norman convinced him that he could hear the grass grow. He tells Lon that was the night he crashed a car, killing Norman and walking away without a scratch himself. Hud expects the story will change Lon's opinion of him, but it doesn't. The two of them walk into the house singing loudly. Homer hears them and can tell they're drunk. He asks Lon ""What else has he give you a taste for?"" Homer tells Hud he doesn't have a problem with Lon having a drink, but Hud Hud asks what's bothering him.
Homer: You, Hud. Like always.
Lon: Hey, waht are you climbing on Hud foor?
Homer: Yo think a lot of Hud, do ya? You think he's a real man. Well, you're being took in. Hud: You listen to him honcho. He's my daddy and he knows...
Homer: I know ya. You're smart. You got your share of guts. You can talk a man into trusting ya, and a woman into wanting ya. Hud: I got it made ain't I? Homer: To hear you tell it.
Hud: Why don't you get it off your chest. What's been griping ya all this time is what I dne to Norman,
Homer: You were drunk and careless of your brother. Hud: You had fifteen years to get over it, that's half of my life. Homer: That's not our quarrel and never has been.
Hud: The hell it isn't.
Homer: No, boy. I was sick of you a long time before that. Hud: Well, isn't life full of surprises? All along, I thought it was because of what I done to my big brother. Homer: I took that hard, but I buried it. Hud: Well alright I'll bite. What turned you sour on me? Not that I give a damn. Homer: Just that Hud, you don't give a damn. That's all. That's the whole of it. You still don't get it, do ya? You don't care about people Hud. You don't give a damn about em. You got all that charm going for ya and it makes the youngsters want to be like ya. That's the shame of it, because ya don't value nothin'. You don't respect nothin'. You keep no check on your appetites at all. You live just for yourself and that makes ya not fit to live with.
Hud: My Momma loved me, but she died.
Hud leaves and Lon tells Homer he shouldn't pick on Hud, as everyone around is like him in some way. Homer tells him ""That's no cause for rejoicing. Little by little the look of the country changes because of the men we admire""
Lon: I still think you nailed him pretty hard.
Homer: Did I? Maybe. Old people get as hard as their arteries. You're just going to have to make up your own mind one day, about what's right and what's wrong.Lon goes to check on Hud who's upset that Alma's asleep when he wants to eat something. Lon offers to cook something but Hud yells at him to leave while he has another drink.The next day Lon is out watching the rodeo. Hud stops by and finds him offering Lon ten dollars to get himself a good seat, and promises there's more money to come. Hud reveals that he's talked with a lawyer who told him ""There's a law that says when old folks can't cut the mustard anymore, you can make them let go, whether they like it or not."" Lon is disgusted with the idea and tries to return the ten dollars. Hud tries to explain that he just wants what he's worked for for years and says ""You don't look out for yourself, the only helping hand you'll ever get is when they lower the box."" Later on, Hud sits in his room drinking and watching TV. Homer comes in and confronts him about Lon has told him.Hud is proud to tell Homer that when the cattle situation is over, whatever happens ""you better get yourself a rocking chair and get out of my way."" Homer tells him there's no way he can get control of the property while he's above ground. Homer admits he might have made some mistakes and been too hard on Hud. Hud tells him ""You ain't never been wrong."" painting Homer as uncompromising and holier than thou, and the concluding ""So I just naturally had to go bad in the face of so much good."" Homer wonders how a man like Hud can be his son and leaves the room. Hud follows him yelling ""You've got the same feeling beneath your belt as any other man, that's how you got stuck with me for a son."" Lon hears the yelling and comes out of his room but Hud runs past him and heads to Alma's room when he sees her outside. SHe sees he's in rare form and runs inside, locking the door as fast as she can, but Hud kicks the door open and grabs her and starts kissing her forcibly, escalating as she struggles, meaning to rape her. Lon interrupts before that happens. Hud easily bests him, but can't bring hiself to punch Lon, so leaves instead.The next day the vet tells them that it is foot and mouth disease which means all of the animals have to be killed and quickly. The vet tries to cheer up Homer telling him he might sell some oil leases anyway. Hud speaks up about it saying ""My Daddy thinks that oil is something you stick in your salad dressing."" Homer says ""If there's oil down there, you can get it sucked up after I'm under there with it. But, I don't like it and I don't aim to have it. There'll be no holes punched in this land while I'm here. They ain't gonna come in here and grade no road so the wind can blow me away. What's oil to me? What can I do with a bunch of rotten oil wells? I can't ride out every day and prowl amongst 'em like I can my cattle. I can't breed 'em or tend 'em or rope 'em or chase 'em or nothing. I can't feel a smidgen of pride in 'em 'cause they ain't none of my doing. Hud says ""There's money in it."" Homer answers ""I don't want that kind of money. I want mine to come from something that keeps a man doing for himself.""They then have a big pit dug to herd the cattle into. Homer gets all of the help together with guns and they shoot all the cattle from above until they're all dead while Homer forces himself to oversee it. Lon remarks ""That didn't take long."" And Homer says ""It doesn't take long to kill things, not like it does to grow."" Bulldozers start filling in the hole with dirt. Homer still has his two Longhorn steer and is watching them and one of the government guys notices them as well and moves to enter their pen. Homer tells him he's going to kill them himself, but the man says ""There's no guarantee that you'll do it."" The vet hears the argument and calls the man off, willing to take Homer's word. He apologizes to Homer who remarks ""He ain't such a bad fella, just got a cruddy job."" Homer next lets all of his ranch hands go and asks for his rifle. He tells Lon ""I've chased them Longhorns many a mile. I don't know if I can kill 'em, but I guess I can."" He tells Lon to go somewhere else and shoots them both, needing a couple shots for each. Hud listens a little ways away and tells Lon ""Them old bulls are hard to kill.""Alma is packing her things to leave. Lon gives her a ride to the bus station and tries to talk her into staying. She tells him to take care of his grandfather and not to be lazy and gives him a hug. Hud happens to be passing the bus stop and sees her there. He apologizes saying ""Looks like we're losing a good cook. Maybe we should've boosted your salary a little. You ain't letting that little ruckus we had run you off?""
Alma: As far as I can get on a bus ticket.
Hud: You telling me i'm the first guy who ever stuck his foot in your door?
Alma: No.
Hud: First one who ever got rough huh? Well, I'm sorry. It ain't my style. I don't usually get rough with my women. I generally don't have to. Alma: You're rough on everybody.
Hud: So they tell me.
Alma: You want to know something funny? It would've happened eventually without the roughhouse. You look pretty good without your shirt on you know. The sight of that through the kitchen window made me put down my dish towel more than once. Hud: Why didn't you speak up sooner?
The bus pulls up and Alma gets on. Hud calls after her :I'll remember you honey. You're the one that got away.The bus takes off. Lon is driving home in the dark and Hud comes up speeding behind him. Hud bumps into Lon's car to nudge him. Lon sees Homer crawling across the road and slams his brakes sending his car off the road. Hud doesn't know what happened and yells at Lon telling him he'll be paying to fix the car for a long time. Lon tells him he saw Homer in the road and Hud rushes out to check.Homer is still conscious and tells them he fell off his horse. Hud tells Lon to take his car and go call for an ambulance, but when the car won't start Hud tells him to bring the whiskey. Homer tells them he feels like giving up. He tells Hud ""They're waiting on me. And he ain't a patient man."" Hud tells Lon that Homer's gone. Hud tells Lon that ""he couldn't have made it another hour, any way in the world."" Lon answers ""He could've if he'd wanted to. You fixed it so he didn't want to anymore.""
Hud: You don't know the whole story. Yeah, him and me fought many and many a round together, but I guess you could say that I helped him about as much as he ever helped me.
Lon: How did you help him Hud? By trying to sell him out? By taking the heart out of him? By making him give up and quit? Is that how you helped him?We next see Lon and Hud at Homer's funeral service. One of the mourners tells Lon ""Look at it this way, he's gone to a better place."" Lon says ""I don't think so. Not unless dirt is a better place than air."" Lon walks away. We then see Hud pulling into their property with his car still damaged. He sees lon walking around and tells him they buried Homer. Lon is carrying his things and Hud asks him where he's going.Lon tells Hud he's going somewhere else to work for awhile. Hud expresses concern that Lon's too green to make it on his own. He tells Lon a story about his grandfather giving him a Mars bar when he joined the army and telling him, ""Character's the only thing I got to give you. Be a man."" Lon answers ""Well I guess he was kind of worried, your trying so hard to get out of the draft and all."" Hud tells Lon that if he isn't succesful he can come back and work for him, but Lon says he won't be back. Hud tells him "" I guess you've come to be of your Granddaddy's opinion that I ain't fit to live with. That's too bad. Yeah, we mightta whooped it up some, you and me. That's the way you used to want it.""
Lon: I useta. So long, Hud.Lon starts walking again and Hud yells after him ""You know something Fantan? This world's so fulla crap, a man's gonna get into it sooner or later whether he's careful or not.""
Hud walks into the empty house and gets a drink. He lights a cigarette, looking out the open door in thought. He then waves and closes the door behind him as he goes back in the house.

                    In eighteenth-century England, ""first cousins"" Tom Jones and Master Blifil grew up together in privilege in the western countryside, but could not be more different in nature. Tom, the bastard son of one of Squire Allworthy's servants Jenny Jones and the local barber Partridge, was raised by virtuous Allworthy as his own after he sent Jenny away. Tom is randy, chasing anything in a skirt, he's having a sexual relationship on the sly with Molly Seagrim, the peasant daughter of Allworthy's gamekeeper. Tom is nonetheless kind-hearted and good-natured, he who is willing to defend that and those in which he believes. Blifil, on the other hand, is dour, and although outwardly pious, is cold-hearted and vengeful. Despite his randiness, Tom eventually falls in love with Sophie Western, who has just returned to the area after a few years abroad. Despite Sophie's love for Tom, Squire Western and his spinster sister would rather see Sophie marry Blifil rather than a bastard, who Western nonetheless liked before he knew that Tom liked Sophie. Based on half truths, Tom, out of circumstance, is forced to leave his home and strike out on his own in London. While Sophie sneaks away in search of Tom, and Squire Western and Miss Western go off in search of Sophie, Tom gets into one misadventure after another on his way to London, some involving his randiness, and some which will reveal certain aspects of his life previously unknown to him. Through it all, Sophie, deep down, is never far from his mind, even when his life is in danger.

Through his experiments he develops an eye drop that allows a monkey to see through hard material and his gal-pal Dr. Diane Fairfax (Diana Van der Vlis) is astounded at the discovery. Xavier turns to his friend Dr. Sam Brant (Harold J. Stone) to aid him in administering the drug on himself to record the details first hand, but Brant doesnt want to because too much is still unknown about the drug. Xavier goes forward with his plans and discovers a wealth of new visual abilities he didnt posses before. His ability to see through material prevents a miss-diagnosed surgery but puts him at odds with the attending physician at his hospital. Brant tries to prevent Xavier from continuing the drug because of the physical damage to his system. In the midst of an argument Xavier accidentally causes the death of Brant and Diane convinces Xavier to flee until he can pull himself together and explain what happened. Xavier drops out of sight until Diane tracks him down and discovers that by continually using the vision drug Xavier has developed a sensitivity that has caused shocking changes in the doctors persona. As the police close in and crosses paths with a religious preacher the doctor takes some actions that have drastic aftereffects.

His compass having failed, he throws it away and continues on. Passing out from thirst and fatigue, he falls from his horse on the beach. This is noticed by Stefan (Dick Miller), servant of Baron Von Leppe (Boris Karloff), from a rocky cliff. Awakened by the incoming tide, he gets up and notices a girl (Sandra Knight) standing in the hollow of an offshore rock formation where the waves crash through. Calling out to her, he asks if she has drinking water. She makes her way back to shore saying nothing. He follows her to a mountain spring flowing from rocks into the sea. She tells him he may drink of this clear water. He crouches and cups the water in his hands to drink and splash his face. As he straightens up to thank her, she seems to have vanished. Looking around, he sees her drawing spring water from a bucket tied to a rope. He engages her in conversation and she says her name is Helene. He follows her through the forest and up the mountain, ending up back on the beach, where she heads back to the rock opening in the sea. He calls to her and questions her but she stares blindly. Wading back into the sea, he follows her but is attacked by a falcon. He struggles with the bird for a few moments and passes out when a wave overcomes him.He comes to in a shack, covered by a blanket. He looks up and sees Helene smiling at him. Suddenly the image becomes the face of an old woman, Katrina (Dorothy Neumann) the witch. She offers him some tonic from an old bottle, poured into a wooden spoon which she urges him to take. He asks about Helene, but the old woman indicates that it is the falcon, which is seen fluttering its wings. He tells her the bird attacked him but she denies this, trying to show that the bird is friendly. He tells her to take it away and asks about the girl. She says there is no girl, that maybe he had a pleasant illusion. She introduces Gustaf (Jonathan Haze) a mute, who enters. She says it was he who rescued Duvalier and tended to his horse. Later, he is awakened by the window shutter blown by the wind. Getting up, he sees the bird eating a mouse and then flying out an open window. Noticing on the table the blue dress the girl wears when she is Ilsa, he leaves and follows the bird through the forest, finding the girl by the rocky stream again. He speaks to her and she approaches, not speaking. She rests her head on his shoulder, then kisses him and walks away. He follows her through the forest until he runs into Gustaf, who speaks in a whisper, warning him to wait. Picking up a large rock, Gustaf throws it onto the ground where it begins to sink. Realizing the girl was leading him to quicksand, Duvalier tells Gustaf she meant to kill him. Gustaf tells him the girl is possessed and has no mind of her own. He tells the officer to seek her at the Von Leppe castle and that Eric knows the story. Citing danger, Gustaf runs away. Returning to the shack, Duvalier draws a picture of the girl. The witch comes in and suggests he leave to rejoin his regiment. He asks for Gustaf, but is told that he is away. When questioned about why he wants Gustaf, Duvalier replies he wants him to show him the way to the Barons castle. She asks what he wants with the Baron, to which he says he didnt say he was interested in the Baron, but believes the girl lives there. She says the castle has been uninhabited for many years. He says he will find it himself. She warns him not to go, saying there is no girl. He shows her the drawing, which brings a noticeable reaction of recognition to her face. As he leaves, she tells him not to deal with things he doesnt understand. Even though she told him the Baron was dead, she begs him not to inform the Baron that she is living there.Riding along on his horse on mountain roads, he encounters a small avalanche but sees no one who could have caused it. He returns to the spring to splash water on his face, and standing again sees the castle high on a mountaintop. Arriving at the castle in full uniform, he ties his horse and enters the outer courtyard, looking up around him and calling out to see if anyone is home. The girl appears at the window but says nothing. He approaches and knocks on the large oaken doors. Getting no response, the officer shouts that the door should be opened in the name of the government of France. Opening the door is Baron Von Leppe, who says he didnt hear the knock. Inquiring what a French soldier would want, and being told shelter, for one, the Baron suggests he would find better accommodations in the village. Refusing that, Duvalier tells him that he would not want to inconvenience a French officer and is admitted entrance.The Baron and the officer talk and sit at a table where a drink is offered. Stefan enters upon command and is told to fetch cognac for our guest. As the drinks are poured, Duvalier asks about the girl, which brings a surprise to the Barons face. He shows the officer a painting of the Baroness Ilsa Von Leppe, now deceased, which bears resemblance to the girl seen. Insisting the girl is very young and active, Duvalier insults the Baron, who tells him you are speaking of the Baroness Von Leppe, my wife. He is told that Stefan will show him to his room.During the night, when the girl walks through the cemetery, the horse is spooked and forces open the stable door and escapes. Duvalier is studying the drawing when the wind blows into the room and extinguishes the candles. Looking out the window, he sees Helene walking toward the chapel and calls to her to wait until he comes down. She goes inside the chapel, which leads to a mausoleum. Finding his door is locked from the outside, he finds something to try and get the door open. He hears a scrambling and screeching at the door, as if someone is there. Fetching his pistol, he calls for the door to be unlocked, threatening to shoot. At the sound of the door unlocking, he opens it and finds no one. Going downstairs, he goes outside and enters the chapel. Here he observes the crypt entrance to the Baroness Ilsa Von Leppe. He re-enters the castle and notices that the portrait is missing from its frame. Returning to his room, he finds the drawing of the girl ripped apart down the middle.Later, the Baron is eating and speaking with his servant, who suggests maybe the officer has heard rumors in the village. The Baron says that is nonsense, but tells Stefan that Duvalier should leave as soon as possible, cautioning that proper respect is shown the Lieutenant.Coming back to the chapel, Duvalier is questioned by Stefan of his purpose. The officer reminds the servant that he must remember his place. When the name of Eric is mentioned, Stefan shows recognition, but tells the officer to not meddle in affairs of the dead. Duvalier says he will tend to his horse, but the servant stops him, telling him the horse bolted during the night and that he will get him another from the village.Duvalier enters the castle and confronts the Baron abruptly. Incensed, the Baron confesses to the murder of his wife twenty years ago. When he had gone away to war, he returned a year later to find her with another man. It is revealed than Stefan killed her lover and that the Baron has mourned and remained in the castle all these years. It is believed the ghost of Ilsa began coming two years ago and now the Baron looks forward to seeing her.Gustaf talks with Helene on a cliff overlooking the ocean. He tells her that her name is Ilsa and not to trust the old woman. She tells him the witch summoned her from the sea and he says she must return to the sea. He mentions that the Frenchman can help her. At this point the falcon appears and the girl empathically receives a message from the old woman, warning Gustaf not to interfere and that the witch will no longer tolerate him.Stefan goes by night to the witchs shack and observes through the window as she prepares a potion which she pours into a basin, causing a flash of light. Now the girl is seen being hypnotized by the witch, who is using a multi-colored rotating lantern and a magnifying glass while chanting words in Latin. She tells the spirit of Ilsa to fully inhabit the girls body and mind, so the witch can have her vengeance. When the spell is complete, Stefan observes the chair empty. Confronting the old witch, Stefan tells her to leave by tomorrow (for she is squatting on the Barons land) or he will return and burn the shack down. She asks if he knew who lived there years ago and he repeats the question back to her. Eric, she replies.Back at the castle, Stefan tells the Baron that the Frenchman refuses to leave and suggests they kill him. The Baron absolutely refuses and warns him to stay away from the crypt. Meanwhile, Duvalier explores rooms in the castle. He finds a gun case containing two pistols which he examines. Before leaving the room, he finds the missing portrait inside an armoire. Coming out into the hall, he hears the Baron approaching and hides in a room. Then he follows the Baron, who goes to his own room. Duvalier hears voices inside, including the girls. Impulsively he bursts into the room to find only the Baron sitting. Rising quickly, the Baron accuses him of rudely intruding into his bedroom unannounced. After an apology, Duvalier confesses he thought he heard voices. He is lambasted by the Baron, who informs him that he should leave as soon as Stefan returns from the village with a new horse. The officer agrees. When Stefan arrives and presents the animal to Duvalier, he explains that the Barons ways may seem strange to an outsider and that he fears the Baron has never recovered from the death of his wife. Before leaving, the officer asks who Eric is. It is revealed that Eric was the Baronesss lover when the Baron returned from the war.Wandering the beach on his steed, the officer sees Gustaf walking along the cliffsides. At one point he is signaling by waving his arms for Duvalier to go back. The officer stops to observe. Suddenly the falcon appears and attacks Gustaf. After a struggle the bird has pecked out Gustafs eyes and disappeared. Bloody and blind, Gustaf stumbles around and falls off the cliff to rocks below. The officer hurries down and with his last words, Gustaf tells him that the girl loves Duvalier and her soul should be freed tonight if he will return to the castle.That night the officer returns and sees the girl waiting at the door of the chapel. He approaches and they go inside. After a greeting and kiss, they sit and she tells him this is the only place she is free from the spell (inside the chapel). He tells her that she is free everywhere when she is with him. He suggests doctors who can help her in Paris if she will accompany him. There is an agreement and another reassuring kiss. They emerge together from the chapel and Duvalier tells her to wait at the chapel gate. He walks away but when he looks back, she is gone.Back inside the castle, the officer sees the Baron open a portcullis by pulling a chain and pulley, then entering. As he follows, the Baron twists a candlestick and opens a secret door leading down to the crypt below. [This scene is also seen at the beginning of the film.] The Baron is seen kneeling over the coffin of his wife and speaking to her. Her voice can be heard telling him to kill himself by flooding the crypt so they can be together. He says he cannot do this unforgivable sin. She insists he must. Looking up, he sees Ilsa telling him to take his own life. At this point, Duvalier interrupts and runs in, trying to see the woman, who disappears. After unsuccessfully calling for Helene, he sees to the collapsed Baron. Upstairs, Stefan attends to the Baron who is in his bed. The officer is told that this sickness is based on what happens when the girls spirit torments the Baron and that he will soon recover. Duvalier asks for keys to the chapel and they go. Unable to open the door leading to the crypt, the officer asks for a crowbar. As they go outside, Stefan pauses, noticing a light being carried in the tower window. He tells Duvalier that room has been sealed since the death twenty years ago. They hurry upstairs. When told that only the Baron has the room key, Duvalier kicks open the door. They look inside and the officer finds and asks about a childs crib found there. At this moment the Baron arrives and gives Stefan a gun to escort Duvalier from the castle, telling him to shoot if he resists. Another conversation between Ilsa and the Baron convinces him to commit suicide.Outside, the officer is warned by the servant never to return at risk of death. At this point the girl is seen in front of the chapel. Duvalier struggles with Stefan, finally knocking him out with the gun. As he follows the girl into the cemetery, suddenly the witch appears from behind a tombstone. He grabs her arm, threatening her, only to see the falcon approaching to kill him. Cocking the gun, he tells Katrina to call off the bird. She does, informing him that it doesnt matter because tonight the Baron will pay with his own immortal soul for the offence against her. He asks what offence the Baron did her. She tells him that the Baron killed Eric, her son.Stefan, recovered from his blow, returns to the castle to see the Baron raise the portcullis to enter. He tries to interfere, but is struck in the head. Going to the front doors, he opens to Duvalier, who seizes him and asks where the Baron is. He is told that the Baron has gone downstairs to flood the crypt. The officer tells Stefan that the old woman lured Helene to coax the Baron into killing himself to avenge the death of her son Eric, not knowing that it was really Stefan who killed him. Enraged, the witch tries to attack Stefan, who reveals that it was not Eric who was killed that night, but the Baron. For twenty years Eric has pretended to be the Baron. The witch realizes that her son and the girl will soon die in the flood. The officer and the servant rush into the castle and try to follow the Baron. When they are unable to open the secret door, Stefan takes an ax to try to open it. Duvalier says he will try to enter through the chapel. As he runs to the chapel, he grabs the old womans arm, saying he will need her. She fights and cries no, citing that she may not enter the house of God, for she has made her pact with the devil. She breaks away from him at the threshold and turns back to the gate, where she is struck by lightning and her body bursts into flames and is consumed. Duvalier watches in stupefaction, then goes into the chapel. Unable to open the crypt door, he gets a pry bar and works on it. Meanwhile, the Baron, hearing Ilsas voice, pries open the coffin, revealing the body covered in a shroud. She tells him to flood the crypt and he does so, turning a large spindle that opens an underground floodgate. She tells him to look at her by removing the shroud. When he does, he is horrified to see her rotten corpse. She confesses that she is the spirit of Ilsa who has tricked him into giving his soul so hers can be free. Then she calls him Eric. He goes to undo the spindle and the girl struggles with him as the waters flood the room. Stefan, having broken through the secret door, hurries downstairs. Seeing them struggling in the water, Stefan dives in and tries to separate them. The foundations of the castle break under the pressure of the floods and begin to collapse. Finally Duvalier breaks through the crypt door and rushes through underground passages to find the three of them in the water. Diving in, he removes the girl from the water and carries her out. The bodies of Stefan and the Baron are shown in the water, face down. The officer carries Helene outside the chapel and leans her up against a tree. He tells her she is safe now and free. She opens her eyes and looks at him. Free? she replies. He kisses her, but soon recoils in horror as her face begins to bleed and deteriorate. As he looks away and then looks back, her face is melting away to bone.","

Another conversation between Ilsa and the Baron convinces him to commit suicide.Outside, the officer is warned by the servant never to return at risk of death. At this point the girl is seen in front of the chapel. Duvalier struggles with Stefan, finally knocking him out with the gun. As he follows the girl into the cemetery, suddenly the witch appears from behind a tombstone. He grabs her arm, threatening her, only to see the falcon approaching to kill him. Cocking the gun, he tells Katrina to call off the bird. She does, informing him that it doesnt matter because tonight the Baron will pay with his own immortal soul for the offence against her. He asks what offence the Baron did her. She tells him that the Baron killed Eric, her son.Stefan, recovered from his blow, returns to the castle to see the Baron raise the portcullis to enter. He tries to interfere, but is struck in the head. Going to the front doors, he opens to Duvalier, who seizes him and asks where the Baron is. He is told that the Baron has gone downstairs to flood the crypt. The officer tells Stefan that the old woman lured Helene to coax the Baron into killing himself to avenge the death of her son Eric, not knowing that it was really Stefan who killed him. Enraged, the witch tries to attack Stefan, who reveals that it was not Eric who was killed that night, but the Baron. For twenty years Eric has pretended to be the Baron. The witch realizes that her son and the girl will soon die in the flood. The officer and the servant rush into the castle and try to follow the Baron. When they are unable to open the secret door, Stefan takes an ax to try to open it. Duvalier says he will try to enter through the chapel. As he runs to the chapel, he grabs the old womans arm, saying he will need her. She fights and cries no, citing that she may not enter the house of God, for she has made her pact with the devil. She breaks away from him at the threshold and turns back to the gate, where she is struck by lightning and her body bursts into flames and is consumed. Duvalier watches in stupefaction, then goes into the chapel. Unable to open the crypt door, he gets a pry bar and works on it. Meanwhile, the Baron, hearing Ilsas voice, pries open the coffin, revealing the body covered in a shroud. She tells him to flood the crypt and he does so, turning a large spindle that opens an underground floodgate. She tells him to look at her by removing the shroud. When he does, he is horrified to see her rotten corpse. She confesses that she is the spirit of Ilsa who has tricked him into giving his soul so hers can be free. Then she calls him Eric. He goes to undo the spindle and the girl struggles with him as the waters flood the room. Stefan, having broken through the secret door, hurries downstairs. Seeing them struggling in the water, Stefan dives in and tries to separate them. The foundations of the castle break under the pressure of the floods and begin to collapse. Finally Duvalier breaks through the crypt door and rushes through underground passages to find the three of them in the water. Diving in, he removes the girl from the water and carries her out. The bodies of Stefan and the Baron are shown in the water, face down. The officer carries Helene outside the chapel and leans her up against a tree. He tells her she is safe now and free. She opens her eyes and looks at him. Free? she replies. He kisses her, but soon recoils in horror as her face begins to bleed and deteriorate. As he looks away and then looks back, her face is melting away to bone.

"35","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057611/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","When Bergman started shooting ""The Silence,"" he explained that it was the final installment of his film trilogy, which started with ""Through Glass Darkly,"" followed by ""Winter Light."" This trilogy corresponds to the start in a new direction taken by Ingmar Bergman: ""chamber films,"" so named for their analogy to chamber music. In ""The Silence,"" God has totally disappeared from the world. We are now faced with an absolute silence, resulting from a complete breakdown of communication between human beings.First Movement. After vacationing abroad, young Johan (Jorgen Lindstrom), his mother, Anna (Gunnel Lindblom), and his aunt Ester (Ingrid Thulin), are aboard a train, returning to their home in Sweden -- but we won't know these characters' names until about the middle of the film. The train whistle has just awakened Johan, who walks to the train compartment window. The atmosphere in the compartment is stiflingly hot. Anna, leaning against the back of the seat, perspiring and obviously uncomfortable, is fanning herself with a book. Ester, by contrast, is sitting upright, apparently unaffected by the heat. They are arriving in Timoka, a town in a country with a totally incomprehensible language. Johan asks Ester what a small sign on the window means, but even though she is an interpreter, she does not know the language. As she answers Johan, she has a paroxysm of coughing which stains her handkerchief with blood. Anna tries to help her, but Ester pushes her away and rushes from the compartment. A while later, Ester is back in her seat and condescends to accept Anna's help. Anna closes the door of the compartment, leaving Johan outside. Left to himself, Johan walks down the corridor, peeking into other compartments, and looking out through the windows. On a parallel track, a train of flatbed wagons passes, carrying tanks: obviously, there is a war or a revolution underway, or about to start.The train enters the station, brakes squealing and grinding. The next scene shows our three characters in a hotel room. Because of Ester's sickness, Anna and Ester have decided to stop for a time in Timoka, until Ester is better able to travel. The three take over two large rooms which communicate through a large doorway. Johan goes to the window to look at the street below, where feverish activities point toward a possibly imminent disaster. Anna decides to take a bath and asks Johan to come and scrub her back. Johan's obvious delight at being close to his mother is brief, as Anna cuts short this intimate moment and sends him back to the room to take a nap.Meanwhile, in the other room Ester is in bed, chain-smoking, drinking, and reading a book. As she has emptied her bottle, she rings the hotel floor porter (Hakan Jahnberd). The old man comes in, and Ester, not being able to communicate with him through the different languages she knows, manages through gestures to express her need for more alcohol. The porter returns with a bottle and leaves the room. Ester goes in her sister's room and contemplates Anna and Johan as they sleep. She returns to her own bed, unbuttons her pajamas and proceeds to masturbate. Suddenly, the deafening roar of airplanes fills the room, jolting Johan awake once more. He dresses, puts his cap-pistol in his belt and leaves the room, embarking on a lengthy exploration of the cheerless hotel's hallways. Johan first encounters a workman sitting on the top of a ladder, and shoots at him with the cap-pistol. Next, he hides behind an armchair and shoots at the old porter, who sits in his cubicle. When the old man makes a friendly gesture toward Johan, Johan runs away. Further down the hallway, he meets a dwarf whom he salutes. Coming into a turn of the hallway, Johan finds himself face to face with a reproduction of Ruben's Dejanira Abducted by Nessus. Meanwhile, Ester is in her bedroom on her hands and knees, spying through the doorway on her naked sister as Anna cools herself off with water from the sink.It should be noted that many of these scenes are in fact happening simultaneously, for example, the scenes of Johan studying the painting and Ester spying on her sister, indicating a parallelism in subject matter .Johan comes upon the open door of a room occupied by a group of dwarfs, part of a traveling Spanish troop. He goes in, but not before having ""shot"" three of them. They dress him up with a girl's dress, all the while speaking in Spanish, which although a more accessible language, is still foreign to Johan. The dwarf he had previously encountered in the hallway comes in and scolds his fellow dwarfs, and after taking the girl's dress off Johan, escorts him out. Johan manifests his frustration at being once more excluded by urinating in the hallway.In parallel with the previous scene, the meaning of Anna's lipstick, in a close-up shot, readying herself to go out, and its implication regarding Anna's state of mind cannot be missed. As she leaves, we see Ester's fury at having once more lost control over her sister. Anna wanders in a street crowded only with men. She enters a café and meets a young waiter (Birger Malmsten). She then goes to a variety theater where the group of dwarfs is performing. She sits in a loge where, next to her, a couple is having sex. She watches for a while, fascinated and at the same time, somewhat repulsed. She leaves the theater and returns to the café, where she communicates through a glance her immediate need to the young waiter.Johan is still walking the hotel halls. He sees the old porter having lunch in his cubicle. The porter persuades Johan to come and sit on his lap to look at old photographs. One photograph shows a family group with a young boy, probably the porter, standing around a coffin that contains a woman, who may be the porter's mother. At that moment, Anna walks down the hallway, and Johan runs to her and hugs her. Anna goes to her room but, anticipating a quarrel with her sister, stops Johan from following her. Johan, angered at being again rejected, resumes his walk along the hotel corridors. He slips the old man's photograph under a rug in a sign of protest over his latest dismissal.Anna is followed into her room by Ester who notices Anna's soiled dress, and understands what has happened during Anna's visit to the outside world. At this point, Anna demands that her sister stop her spying, and insists that she leave her alone.Second Movement. Later in the evening, Ester is in at the window in her own room, watching the strange evening activities below. She is listening to the radio, which is broadcasting one of Bach's Goldberg Variations. The porter, bringing in tea, recognizes the ""mooseek,"" and names the composer, ""Johan Sebastian Bach."". During this peaceful moment of understanding, Ester tells Anna that she and Johan should leave this same evening, and she will follow them at a later time, when she feels better. Anna refuses, not out of compassion for Ester, but probably because she has another rendezvous later that evening with the young waiter. Anna is about to leave the room when Ester turns off the uniting music and verbally attacks her. Once more, Anna sends Johan out of the room. Spitefully, Anna recounts her afternoon encounter with the young waiter in great detail to her sister. Ester is at once upset by these revelations, but also seems to enjoy them. Ester tries to dissuade Anna from going to meet her lover again, but to no avail.Anna meets the young waiter in the hotel hallway and they both enter an adjacent room. Johan listens for a while, his ear pressed against the door, and then wanders off down the corridors, lonely and disoriented. He returns to his room, goes to bed, and reads a little. Then, just as he enters his aunt's room, a prolonged rumbling brings him to the window, where he sees a tank parked in front of the hotel. Ester wakes and asks him to read something to her. Johan instead proposes to put on his Punch and Judy show. He proceeds with a violent puppet show, in which Punch beats Judy while speaking an incomprehensible tongue. Ester asks the meaning of this, and Johan replies that when Punch is afraid, he speaks this kind of funny language. Suddenly, Johan's pent-up emotions surface, and he rushes into his aunt's arms, sobbing. Outside the hotel, in a rumbling, the tank leaves the scene. Johan asks Ester to write few words of the strange local language she would have translated, which Ester promises to do.Meanwhile next door, after an amorous encounter, Anna and her boyfriend are ""talking."" That is, Anna is delivering a monologue of her inner thoughts, since they cannot otherwise verbally communicate. She hears Ester at the door sobbing, wanting to come in. Anna, still talking, opens the door and unloads all her repressed resentments on her sister. Ester leaves as the young waiter takes Anna once more.Third Movement. Some time later, in Ester's room, as Anna is leaving the room to go for breakfast with Johan, she tells her bed-ridden sister that she and Johan are leaving in the afternoon. An hour passes and Ester is lying in her bed. She is furious because Anna and Johan have not yet returned. She launches into an angry monologue that provokes a terrible spasm. The old porter does his best to help Ester in her distress. He realizes that she is dying, but he cannot communicate any words of comfort. The spasm subsides and Ester pulls a sheet over her face. She is lying under the sheets when Johan and Anna return. Johan is briefly afraid that Ester is dead, but she reassures him, and hands him the letter she wrote for him.In the next and final scene, Anna and Johan are together in a train compartment, on their way home to Sweden. Johan reads Ester's letter, titled ""To Johan: Words in a Foreign Language."" The film ends as it started, with an extreme close-up of Johan at the compartment window, muttering the few words written by his aunt.","

She returns to her own bed, unbuttons her pajamas and proceeds to masturbate. Suddenly, the deafening roar of airplanes fills the room, jolting Johan awake once more. He dresses, puts his cap-pistol in his belt and leaves the room, embarking on a lengthy exploration of the cheerless hotel's hallways. Johan first encounters a workman sitting on the top of a ladder, and shoots at him with the cap-pistol. Next, he hides behind an armchair and shoots at the old porter, who sits in his cubicle. When the old man makes a friendly gesture toward Johan, Johan runs away. Further down the hallway, he meets a dwarf whom he salutes. Coming into a turn of the hallway, Johan finds himself face to face with a reproduction of Ruben's Dejanira Abducted by Nessus. Meanwhile, Ester is in her bedroom on her hands and knees, spying through the doorway on her naked sister as Anna cools herself off with water from the sink.It should be noted that many of these scenes are in fact happening simultaneously, for example, the scenes of Johan studying the painting and Ester spying on her sister, indicating a parallelism in subject matter .Johan comes upon the open door of a room occupied by a group of dwarfs, part of a traveling Spanish troop. He goes in, but not before having ""shot"" three of them. They dress him up with a girl's dress, all the while speaking in Spanish, which although a more accessible language, is still foreign to Johan. The dwarf he had previously encountered in the hallway comes in and scolds his fellow dwarfs, and after taking the girl's dress off Johan, escorts him out. Johan manifests his frustration at being once more excluded by urinating in the hallway.In parallel with the previous scene, the meaning of Anna's lipstick, in a close-up shot, readying herself to go out, and its implication regarding Anna's state of mind cannot be missed. As she leaves, we see Ester's fury at having once more lost control over her sister. Anna wanders in a street crowded only with men. She enters a café and meets a young waiter (Birger Malmsten). She then goes to a variety theater where the group of dwarfs is performing. She sits in a loge where, next to her, a couple is having sex. She watches for a while, fascinated and at the same time, somewhat repulsed. She leaves the theater and returns to the café, where she communicates through a glance her immediate need to the young waiter.Johan is still walking the hotel halls. He sees the old porter having lunch in his cubicle. The porter persuades Johan to come and sit on his lap to look at old photographs. One photograph shows a family group with a young boy, probably the porter, standing around a coffin that contains a woman, who may be the porter's mother. At that moment, Anna walks down the hallway, and Johan runs to her and hugs her. Anna goes to her room but, anticipating a quarrel with her sister, stops Johan from following her. Johan, angered at being again rejected, resumes his walk along the hotel corridors. He slips the old man's photograph under a rug in a sign of protest over his latest dismissal.Anna is followed into her room by Ester who notices Anna's soiled dress, and understands what has happened during Anna's visit to the outside world. At this point, Anna demands that her sister stop her spying, and insists that she leave her alone.Second Movement. Later in the evening, Ester is in at the window in her own room, watching the strange evening activities below. She is listening to the radio, which is broadcasting one of Bach's Goldberg Variations. The porter, bringing in tea, recognizes the ""mooseek,"" and names the composer, ""Johan Sebastian Bach."". During this peaceful moment of understanding, Ester tells Anna that she and Johan should leave this same evening, and she will follow them at a later time, when she feels better. Anna refuses, not out of compassion for Ester, but probably because she has another rendezvous later that evening with the young waiter. Anna is about to leave the room when Ester turns off the uniting music and verbally attacks her. Once more, Anna sends Johan out of the room. Spitefully, Anna recounts her afternoon encounter with the young waiter in great detail to her sister. Ester is at once upset by these revelations, but also seems to enjoy them. Ester tries to dissuade Anna from going to meet her lover again, but to no avail.Anna meets the young waiter in the hotel hallway and they both enter an adjacent room. Johan listens for a while, his ear pressed against the door, and then wanders off down the corridors, lonely and disoriented. He returns to his room, goes to bed, and reads a little. Then, just as he enters his aunt's room, a prolonged rumbling brings him to the window, where he sees a tank parked in front of the hotel. Ester wakes and asks him to read something to her. Johan instead proposes to put on his Punch and Judy show. He proceeds with a violent puppet show, in which Punch beats Judy while speaking an incomprehensible tongue. Ester asks the meaning of this, and Johan replies that when Punch is afraid, he speaks this kind of funny language. Suddenly, Johan's pent-up emotions surface, and he rushes into his aunt's arms, sobbing. Outside the hotel, in a rumbling, the tank leaves the scene. Johan asks Ester to write few words of the strange local language she would have translated, which Ester promises to do.Meanwhile next door, after an amorous encounter, Anna and her boyfriend are ""talking."" That is, Anna is delivering a monologue of her inner thoughts, since they cannot otherwise verbally communicate. She hears Ester at the door sobbing, wanting to come in. Anna, still talking, opens the door and unloads all her repressed resentments on her sister. Ester leaves as the young waiter takes Anna once more.Third Movement. Some time later, in Ester's room, as Anna is leaving the room to go for breakfast with Johan, she tells her bed-ridden sister that she and Johan are leaving in the afternoon. An hour passes and Ester is lying in her bed. She is furious because Anna and Johan have not yet returned. She launches into an angry monologue that provokes a terrible spasm. The old porter does his best to help Ester in her distress. He realizes that she is dying, but he cannot communicate any words of comfort. The spasm subsides and Ester pulls a sheet over her face. She is lying under the sheets when Johan and Anna return. Johan is briefly afraid that Ester is dead, but she reassures him, and hands him the letter she wrote for him.In the next and final scene, Anna and Johan are together in a train compartment, on their way home to Sweden. Johan reads Ester's letter, titled ""To Johan: Words in a Foreign Language."" The film ends as it started, with an extreme close-up of Johan at the compartment window, muttering the few words written by his aunt.

She considers her life like living in a fishbowl, where her brothers control everything: what she does, who she sees and to who she should get married. That intended husband is Anthony Columbo, a shy, clumsy man, with who she doesn't hear the ""bells and banjos"" she envisions with romantic love. As an act of defiance, Angie has a one-night stand - her first and only sexual encounter - with womanizing jazz trumpeter Rocky Papasano, a man she doesn't even know. Rocky escaped a life much like Angie's. His Italian-American parents still live in the Bowery where he grew up and where he doesn't visit often as it reminds him of the repressive lifestyle of unhappy married people as witnessed by his old neighborhood friends. Angie manages to track down Rocky to tell him that she is pregnant with his child. Despite barely remembering Angie, Rocky decides to help Angie with the one and only thing she requests: the name of a doctor to abort the pregnancy. As Angie and Rocky spend the day together leading up to the scheduled abortion, they begin to get to know each other in all its good and bad. This day begins the process of both really figuring out what they want in life.

"39","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056993/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","DIARY OF A MADMAN aka THE HORLA The film begins with this quote: the vulture has eaten the pigeon; the wolf has eaten the lamb; the lion has devoured the sharp-tongued buffalo; man has killed the lion with an arrow, with a spear, with gunpowder; but the HORLA will make of man what man has made of the horse and of the ox; his chattel, his slave and his food by the mere power of his will. Woe to us!Guy de Maupassant.A graveside service is being held for Magistrate Simon Cordier (Vincent Price). After it is over, each member of the assembled pitches in a bit of dirt. Andre DArville (Edward Colmans) tells Police Captain Robert Rennedon (Stephen Roberts) that the deceased gave a wish for those involved to meet after the funeral. He tells him that they are willing to do so. Jeanne DArville (Elaine Devry) expresses her disgust for Cordier but agrees to meet.At the Galerie DArville Andre takes charge of the meeting, citing that Cordier gave the house to the DArvilles, even though they were known for disliking him. A letter is produced, said to be written by Cordier to be read after his passing. It states that in the event of his death that night, the chest was not to be opened except after the funeral. Father Raymonde (Lewis Martin) wonders why Cordier would think he might die that night. Capt. Rennedon tells him that his investigation proves it was not accidental.Inside the chest is a diary belonging to Cordier and a letter explaining why he could not tell what he is telling now after his death. His servants Pierre (Ian Wolfe) and Louise (Mary Adams) state that they knew nothing about this or about a diary. Rennedon is impatient for the diary to be read.[FROM THE DIARY] Beginning on the day of the execution of Louis Girot (Harvey Stephens), Rennedon visits Cordier in his office. He informs Cordier that Girot wants to see him in his cell. They both leave to go to the jail.Girot claims that an evil force within him caused him to kill his victims. Cordier doesnt believe any of it. Girot tells him that he wants to die to be free of the possession. His eyes glowing green, he attacks Cordier, but falls to his death. Rennedon has the cell opened and has the guard go for a doctor.At his residence, Cordier asks Pierre to bring a cognac into the study. Entering the study, he admires his caged bird who sings. Suddenly he is shocked to see a framed photograph of his late wife and child on the wall. He pulls the servant cord and asks Pierre how the picture got back onto the wall. Pierre swears that no one has been in the house except himself and Louise and that they didnt have anything to do with this. Cordier returns the photo to the chest in his attic and notices written in the dust on the front of a bust of his late wife the words  Hatred is Evil.  Pierre enters and Cordier tells him about the writing, which has disappeared when they look for it.Pierre and Louise discuss what the matter with Cordier might be. They are puzzled.In the study, Cordier sips his cognac and asks Pierre whether or not Cordier ever sleepwalks. Pierre replies that he doesnt know since his quarters are in another part of the house. Cordier speculates that maybe memories of his late wife and child have returned to cause these things.The next morning in his office, Cordier asks his assistant Martin (Dick Wilson) to bring him a certain file. On his desk, Cordier is surprised to see the file of Girot. He questions Martin about it. Martin says the office was locked and suggests that maybe Cordier left it there the night before.Looking at the Girot testimony from the trial, Cordier asks Martin to summon the building superintendant to see if anyone could have moved the file. When he turns back to his desk, a bottle of ink has spilled, ruining the testimony papers. As he blots the ink, a mans laughter is heard. Cordier asks if someone is there. He sits down and hears more laughter, followed by a voice (the Horla) (Joseph Ruskin) telling him that since Girot is dead he wont be needing the testimony. He also hears that since Girot is dead that the voice will inhabit the body of Cordier. There is a gust of wind and the French doors close.When Cordier tries to hold court, he is unable to focus and has to postpone court proceedings. Back in his office, he writes in his diary about the impending fear of oncoming madness. The voice is heard again, telling him that their association has just begun. Cordiers eyes are shown with the green tint. He is told to rise and kill the bird. When he comes back to himself, he looks for the bird and finds it dead on the floor.Visiting Dr. Borman (Nelson Olmsted), Cordier confesses to hearing the voice and being unable to resist what he is told to do. Borman tells him that it is all in his mind and that he should change his lifebecome a sculptor againsomething he did when he was younger. Borman says that science doesnt believe in ghosts and spirits and that only Cordier can cure himself.Out on the street, Cordier sees a painting of a woman by Paul Duclasse (Chris Warfield) and is immediately approached by the subject, Odette Malotte (Nancy Kovack), who suggests he sculpt her. He agrees and gives her his card.Odette goes into the gallery and asks Andre and Jeanne how the sales are going. She is told that Paul is a new artist and it takes time for popularity to grow. Odette tells Jeanne that they both have Pauls interests at heart. Jeanne is very uncomfortable with this personal insinuation and tells Odette that Paul is in the office. Odette goes upstairs.In the office, Odette speaks to her husband, Paul, who tells her one painting sold for thirty francs, which she scoffs at. She tells him she has a job as a model, posing for ten francs an hour. She convinces him that they need the money and that she will return with a bottle of wine to celebrate.That night Odette knocks on the door and Pierre answers. He invites her and tells her he will inform Cordier that she has arrived. Cordier greets her and takes her upstairs to the studio. Pierre and Louise watch and comment on how long it has been since a woman came to the house.In the attic (which has been cleaned up to be a studio) Odette poses on a chair and Cordier suggests she achieve a look of gaiety. She lowers her dress below her shoulders and releases her hair. Cordier likes the pose and begins sketching.Next we hear Cordiers voice explaining that time passes quickly and that the voices are not heard during this period. He presents the bust as completed and they look at it. She remarks how he kept a bust of his late wife up in the attic. He tells her that she died by suicide and was not buried in the churchyard. He suggests that he might want to do a full sculpture of her and that he will contact her at that time.The Horla speaks after she leaves, telling Cordier that his reflection in the mirror is blocked by the body of the Horla. Cordier throws a case of artists tools at the mirror but still sees no reflection. Only when the Horla steps aside does Cordier see his own reflection. He is told that he is a murderer and that that evil drew the Horla to him forever. It is said that he drove his wife to suicide, blaming her for the death of his son. He denies this. The Horla tells him that Odette was not who she seemed to be. As he is directed to look at the clay sculpture, he sees it change to an evil expression. The Horla leaves by a window. Calling Pierre upstairs, Cordier gets him to witness that the sculpture has changed.Lying in his bed later, Cordier sees the French doors open and the Horla enters. He is told to pursue the woman and pretend there is love. He refuses but the Horla insists that he will force him to do what he says.Pierre and Louise are seen looking at the portrait of Odette, which now hangs in the spot where Cordiers late wife was displayed. The carriage arrives and Cordier escorts Odette into the house. He tells Pierre to tell Louise to prepare the finest dinner and wine from 1881.In the study, Odette sees the portrait and admires it. Cordier confesses his love and suggests that they will begin seeing each other. He proposes marriage and she confesses that it was she who was enamored with him during the sessions. He puts a cameo around her neck, telling her that it once belonged to his wife. She seems impressed.Paul is seen talking to Jeanne (who is also interested in Paul) about his troubles with his wife Odette. He tells her that Odette is no longer interested in him and has moved out into a new apartment. He shows Jeanne a card from Cordier, which Odette had given him. When she left, she told Paul that Cordier could give her all the things she always wanted and Paul could never give. He reminds Jeanne that they are still married.Cordier toasts Odette and tells her that they will honeymoon in his house in Lucerne. She tells him she has one thing she needs to take care of before announcing the wedding. Pierre comes and tells Cordier that he has a visitor: Paul. When she hears Pauls name, she turns away. Cordier asks what Paul means to her and she admits they are married.Paul is invited into the study, where he immediately sees the painting. Cordier tells him he is a great admirer of Odette. Paul remarks how Odette is his wife and he wants Cordier to leave her alone. Cordier tells him that he loves Odette and that nothing will prevent them from marrying. Paul suggests that the public would be surprised to know about their affair and leaves.Immediately the Horla tells Cordier to kill Paul. He refuses. As Paul nears the front door, a large vase falls, nearly hitting him. Cordier comes and apologizes for the accident. Pierre and Louise look on. Paul remarks that it would have been a convenient accident and leaves. Cordier tells Pierre to clean it up in the morning.In the study, the Horla tells Cordier that the time for killing is not yet. This was done to show how simple killing can be. Cordier argues that he will never kill a human as long as there is a shred of his own will left in him. The Horla leaves and Cordier remembers Odette is waiting outside. He tells her that they must leave right away for Lucerne and gets her promise to come with him.Packing his suitcase, he notices the lamp being turned down. He addresses the Horla, who tells him that he cannot run away from it. Cordier is told to kill Odette. He refuses, but the Horla shows by killing a rose that it is able to manipulate him into doing anything. Cordier fires two shots from his derringer to no avail. He speculates that the Horla must be limited as humans are. The Horla tells him that even a distance away he will be able to kill Paul. Later that night Cordier takes a walk over to Odettes place.Paul shows up at Odettes apartment and beats on the door. She reluctantly lets him in. Seeing the suitcase, he says that she is going away with Cordier. He angrily knocks the suitcase over onto the floor. He tells her that she will bleed the Magistrate dry and then go on to another rich man. She agrees and Paul says he is a fool and that Cordier is a bigger fool. He leaves and Cordier approaches from the shadows.Odette opens the door and is surprised to see Cordier. His facial expression is one of evil. She notices and becomes alarmed. He pulls out a knife and stabs her repeatedly. Returning home to his study, we see the green light go out of his eyes.The next morning Marcel the Postman (Don Brodie) delivers the mail to Cordier, who tells him to forward all mail to Lucerne. A spot of blood is seen on the stairs. Looking at the newspaper, he sees that Odette has been murdered and decapitated. The trail of blood drops goes upstairs. He follows the trail to his studio in the attic. Looking at the sculpture, he pulls away clay from one side to reveal Odettes head beneath.The Horla comes in, telling Cordier that he left last night and killed Odette. He denies this, saying he never left the house. The Horla reminds him that Girot never thought he murdered anyone either.Jeanne goes to the gallery, weeping and telling Andre that Paul has been arrested for the murder of Odette. A witness remembers Paul arguing with Odette that night. Andre promises they will pay for a defense attorney.Cordier speaks to the bust of his late wife, wishing he could bring her back from the dead. Suddenly the Horla bursts in, telling him that he is talking only to his conscience. Cordier insists that his heart is in communication with Helen. The Horla laughs and smashes the sculpture of his late wife. He then tells Cordier to wrap Odettes head in a blue towel and take it to the grave. Directed to the back of his garden, he finds a hole dug in which he places the head. The Horla fills in the dirt, telling him that once the body is buried all traces of the woman will have been removed from his life. He tells Cordier that Paul will die for the murder because he is in control of his life.The Horla tells Cordier to burn the painting and finally gets him to place it in the fire. Capt. Rennedon knocks at the door. The Horla tells Cordier to tell him only what he wants. Rennedon is escorted into the study. He tells Cordier that Paul wants to speak to him. After mentioning how Cordier is a man of justice, Rennedon agrees to bring Paul to the Magistrates chambers the next day at noon.Paul is brought into Cordiers chambers with Rennedon present. Cordier states that he doesnt know Paul and that he didnt know his wife. Paul angrily accuses him of wanting to marry Odette. Cordier tells Paul as the guards lead him away that this stunt will not affect the court into believing that he is insane.Paul and Jeanne discuss what happened. He is surprised that Cordier can deny even knowing Odette. Jeanne tells him that Cordier would not let an innocent man be executed just to save his own reputation. Paul remarks how totally cold and inhuman Cordier seemed and how he showed no grief for the death of Odette. He thanks Jeanne and her father for their help. She tells him they dont want to lose him. He kisses her and says he wanted to when they were children. She kisses him again. He says there must be some way to prove that Cordier knew Odette.Cordier writes in his diary that he is scheduled to preside over the trial of Paul. He cannot in good conscience send an innocent man to the guillotine. He plans suicide and loads his gun. The Horla comes in and takes away the gun. When Cordier tries to retrieve it, the Horla pushes it away. He says he wont allow Cordier to kill himself. There is a knock on the door and Cordier is told to answer it.Jeanne tells Cordier that he bought a painting from her at her fathers gallery. He seems not to remember but invites her in. She insists that she has a good memory and asks why he lied about knowing Odette and Paul. She asks for the servants, saying they know Odette was in the house. He tells her they are in Switzerland. She threatens to tell the police, who will be interested in questioning them.After Jeanne leaves, the Horla tells Cordier that he must kill her. He refuses, but his eyes are seen green-tinted.Jeanne discusses her plans with Andre, who advises her not to accuse the magistrate. She insists that she will go through with it to save Paul.Cordier follows Jeanne on her way home from the gallery. Waiting in the shadows, he pulls out a knife to stab her. Suddenly the reflection of a cross from a store window reflects on the shiny blade. His eyes show green for a moment. When he comes to his right mind, he notices the cross and the knife and throws it away.Standing in front of the church, Father Raymonde comes out and questions Cordier. He asks for sanctuary and wants to confess. Suddenly both of them are almost run down by a wagon. The driver (George Sawaya) finds the reins taken out of his hands, but finally the wagon stops. He runs back to see if the Reverend is all right. Cordier tells Raymonde to tell Jeanne to come see him later at his house.Cordier writes that the Horla is now trying to kill him. There is a knock at the door. Cordier answers and gives the box with his diary in it and the letter of explanation to Jeanne. He tells the Father to take her away safely and pray for him.In the study, Cordier extinguishes all lamps but one on his desk and waits for the Horla. When it comes in through the window, it stumbles around. Cordier tells it that he knows that it fears fire (since it would not cast the painting into the fire itself). He throws the lamp against the curtains and the fire ignites and spreads through the room. The Horla runs around in panic, trying to escape the room. He is unable to open the study door which has been locked by Cordier. With screams the Horla is shown burning to death. Cordier tries to unlock the door to escape but drops the key. He tries a couple of times to retrieve it, but unsuccessfully. The house is shown completely burning.At this point we rejoin the earlier scene where the diary was being read by Andre. Jeanne presses Rennedon about Pauls innocence. He agrees that the diary clears Paul. Andre suggests that the Horla was only in the mind of Cordier, but Father Raymonde cannot deny the presence of evil in the world. He says Cordier wanted everyone to know that as long as evil exists in the heart of man, the Horla lives.","

    Synopsis
    DIARY OF A MADMAN aka THE HORLA The film begins with this quote: the vulture has eaten the pigeon; the wolf has eaten the lamb; the lion has devoured the sharp-tongued buffalo; man has killed the lion with an arrow, with a spear, with gunpowder; but the HORLA will make of man what man has made of the horse and of the ox; his chattel, his slave and his food by the mere power of his will. Woe to us!Guy de Maupassant.A graveside service is being held for Magistrate Simon Cordier (Vincent Price). After it is over, each member of the assembled pitches in a bit of dirt. Andre DArville (Edward Colmans) tells Police Captain Robert Rennedon (Stephen Roberts) that the deceased gave a wish for those involved to meet after the funeral. He tells him that they are willing to do so. Jeanne DArville (Elaine Devry) expresses her disgust for Cordier but agrees to meet.At the Galerie DArville Andre takes charge of the meeting, citing that Cordier gave the house to the DArvilles, even though they were known for disliking him. A letter is produced, said to be written by Cordier to be read after his passing. It states that in the event of his death that night, the chest was not to be opened except after the funeral. Father Raymonde (Lewis Martin) wonders why Cordier would think he might die that night. Capt. Rennedon tells him that his investigation proves it was not accidental.Inside the chest is a diary belonging to Cordier and a letter explaining why he could not tell what he is telling now after his death. His servants Pierre (Ian Wolfe) and Louise (Mary Adams) state that they knew nothing about this or about a diary. Rennedon is impatient for the diary to be read.[FROM THE DIARY] Beginning on the day of the execution of Louis Girot (Harvey Stephens), Rennedon visits Cordier in his office. He informs Cordier that Girot wants to see him in his cell. They both leave to go to the jail.Girot claims that an evil force within him caused him to kill his victims. Cordier doesnt believe any of it. Girot tells him that he wants to die to be free of the possession. His eyes glowing green, he attacks Cordier, but falls to his death. Rennedon has the cell opened and has the guard go for a doctor.At his residence, Cordier asks Pierre to bring a cognac into the study. Entering the study, he admires his caged bird who sings. Suddenly he is shocked to see a framed photograph of his late wife and child on the wall. He pulls the servant cord and asks Pierre how the picture got back onto the wall. Pierre swears that no one has been in the house except himself and Louise and that they didnt have anything to do with this. Cordier returns the photo to the chest in his attic and notices written in the dust on the front of a bust of his late wife the words  Hatred is Evil.  Pierre enters and Cordier tells him about the writing, which has disappeared when they look for it.Pierre and Louise discuss what the matter with Cordier might be. They are puzzled.In the study, Cordier sips his cognac and asks Pierre whether or not Cordier ever sleepwalks. Pierre replies that he doesnt know since his quarters are in another part of the house. Cordier speculates that maybe memories of his late wife and child have returned to cause these things.The next morning in his office, Cordier asks his assistant Martin (Dick Wilson) to bring him a certain file. On his desk, Cordier is surprised to see the file of Girot. He questions Martin about it. Martin says the office was locked and suggests that maybe Cordier left it there the night before.Looking at the Girot testimony from the trial, Cordier asks Martin to summon the building superintendant to see if anyone could have moved the file. When he turns back to his desk, a bottle of ink has spilled, ruining the testimony papers. As he blots the ink, a mans laughter is heard. Cordier asks if someone is there. He sits down and hears more laughter, followed by a voice (the Horla) (Joseph Ruskin) telling him that since Girot is dead he wont be needing the testimony. He also hears that since Girot is dead that the voice will inhabit the body of Cordier. There is a gust of wind and the French doors close.When Cordier tries to hold court, he is unable to focus and has to postpone court proceedings. Back in his office, he writes in his diary about the impending fear of oncoming madness. The voice is heard again, telling him that their association has just begun. Cordiers eyes are shown with the green tint. He is told to rise and kill the bird. When he comes back to himself, he looks for the bird and finds it dead on the floor.Visiting Dr. Borman (Nelson Olmsted), Cordier confesses to hearing the voice and being unable to resist what he is told to do. Borman tells him that it is all in his mind and that he should change his lifebecome a sculptor againsomething he did when he was younger. Borman says that science doesnt believe in ghosts and spirits and that only Cordier can cure himself.Out on the street, Cordier sees a painting of a woman by Paul Duclasse (Chris Warfield) and is immediately approached by the subject, Odette Malotte (Nancy Kovack), who suggests he sculpt her. He agrees and gives her his card.Odette goes into the gallery and asks Andre and Jeanne how the sales are going. She is told that Paul is a new artist and it takes time for popularity to grow. Odette tells Jeanne that they both have Pauls interests at heart. Jeanne is very uncomfortable with this personal insinuation and tells Odette that Paul is in the office. Odette goes upstairs.In the office, Odette speaks to her husband, Paul, who tells her one painting sold for thirty francs, which she scoffs at. She tells him she has a job as a model, posing for ten francs an hour. She convinces him that they need the money and that she will return with a bottle of wine to celebrate.That night Odette knocks on the door and Pierre answers. He invites her and tells her he will inform Cordier that she has arrived. Cordier greets her and takes her upstairs to the studio. Pierre and Louise watch and comment on how long it has been since a woman came to the house.In the attic (which has been cleaned up to be a studio) Odette poses on a chair and Cordier suggests she achieve a look of gaiety. She lowers her dress below her shoulders and releases her hair. Cordier likes the pose and begins sketching.Next we hear Cordiers voice explaining that time passes quickly and that the voices are not heard during this period. He presents the bust as completed and they look at it. She remarks how he kept a bust of his late wife up in the attic. He tells her that she died by suicide and was not buried in the churchyard. He suggests that he might want to do a full sculpture of her and that he will contact her at that time.The Horla speaks after she leaves, telling Cordier that his reflection in the mirror is blocked by the body of the Horla. Cordier throws a case of artists tools at the mirror but still sees no reflection. Only when the Horla steps aside does Cordier see his own reflection. He is told that he is a murderer and that that evil drew the Horla to him forever. It is said that he drove his wife to suicide, blaming her for the death of his son. He denies this. The Horla tells him that Odette was not who she seemed to be. As he is directed to look at the clay sculpture, he sees it change to an evil expression. The Horla leaves by a window. Calling Pierre upstairs, Cordier gets him to witness that the sculpture has changed.Lying in his bed later, Cordier sees the French doors open and the Horla enters. He is told to pursue the woman and pretend there is love. He refuses but the Horla insists that he will force him to do what he says.Pierre and Louise are seen looking at the portrait of Odette, which now hangs in the spot where Cordiers late wife was displayed. The carriage arrives and Cordier escorts Odette into the house. He tells Pierre to tell Louise to prepare the finest dinner and wine from 1881.In the study, Odette sees the portrait and admires it. Cordier confesses his love and suggests that they will begin seeing each other. He proposes marriage and she confesses that it was she who was enamored with him during the sessions. He puts a cameo around her neck, telling her that it once belonged to his wife. She seems impressed.Paul is seen talking to Jeanne (who is also interested in Paul) about his troubles with his wife Odette. He tells her that Odette is no longer interested in him and has moved out into a new apartment. He shows Jeanne a card from Cordier, which Odette had given him. When she left, she told Paul that Cordier could give her all the things she always wanted and Paul could never give. He reminds Jeanne that they are still married.Cordier toasts Odette and tells her that they will honeymoon in his house in Lucerne. She tells him she has one thing she needs to take care of before announcing the wedding. Pierre comes and tells Cordier that he has a visitor: Paul. When she hears Pauls name, she turns away. Cordier asks what Paul means to her and she admits they are married.Paul is invited into the study, where he immediately sees the painting. Cordier tells him he is a great admirer of Odette. Paul remarks how Odette is his wife and he wants Cordier to leave her alone. Cordier tells him that he loves Odette and that nothing will prevent them from marrying. Paul suggests that the public would be surprised to know about their affair and leaves.Immediately the Horla tells Cordier to kill Paul. He refuses. As Paul nears the front door, a large vase falls, nearly hitting him. Cordier comes and apologizes for the accident. Pierre and Louise look on. Paul remarks that it would have been a convenient accident and leaves. Cordier tells Pierre to clean it up in the morning.In the study, the Horla tells Cordier that the time for killing is not yet. This was done to show how simple killing can be. Cordier argues that he will never kill a human as long as there is a shred of his own will left in him. The Horla leaves and Cordier remembers Odette is waiting outside. He tells her that they must leave right away for Lucerne and gets her promise to come with him.Packing his suitcase, he notices the lamp being turned down. He addresses the Horla, who tells him that he cannot run away from it. Cordier is told to kill Odette. He refuses, but the Horla shows by killing a rose that it is able to manipulate him into doing anything. Cordier fires two shots from his derringer to no avail. He speculates that the Horla must be limited as humans are. The Horla tells him that even a distance away he will be able to kill Paul. Later that night Cordier takes a walk over to Odettes place.Paul shows up at Odettes apartment and beats on the door. She reluctantly lets him in. Seeing the suitcase, he says that she is going away with Cordier. He angrily knocks the suitcase over onto the floor. He tells her that she will bleed the Magistrate dry and then go on to another rich man. She agrees and Paul says he is a fool and that Cordier is a bigger fool. He leaves and Cordier approaches from the shadows.Odette opens the door and is surprised to see Cordier. His facial expression is one of evil. She notices and becomes alarmed. He pulls out a knife and stabs her repeatedly. Returning home to his study, we see the green light go out of his eyes.The next morning Marcel the Postman (Don Brodie) delivers the mail to Cordier, who tells him to forward all mail to Lucerne. A spot of blood is seen on the stairs. Looking at the newspaper, he sees that Odette has been murdered and decapitated. The trail of blood drops goes upstairs. He follows the trail to his studio in the attic. Looking at the sculpture, he pulls away clay from one side to reveal Odettes head beneath.The Horla comes in, telling Cordier that he left last night and killed Odette. He denies this, saying he never left the house. The Horla reminds him that Girot never thought he murdered anyone either.Jeanne goes to the gallery, weeping and telling Andre that Paul has been arrested for the murder of Odette. A witness remembers Paul arguing with Odette that night. Andre promises they will pay for a defense attorney.Cordier speaks to the bust of his late wife, wishing he could bring her back from the dead. Suddenly the Horla bursts in, telling him that he is talking only to his conscience. Cordier insists that his heart is in communication with Helen. The Horla laughs and smashes the sculpture of his late wife. He then tells Cordier to wrap Odettes head in a blue towel and take it to the grave. Directed to the back of his garden, he finds a hole dug in which he places the head. The Horla fills in the dirt, telling him that once the body is buried all traces of the woman will have been removed from his life. He tells Cordier that Paul will die for the murder because he is in control of his life.The Horla tells Cordier to burn the painting and finally gets him to place it in the fire. Capt. Rennedon knocks at the door. The Horla tells Cordier to tell him only what he wants. Rennedon is escorted into the study. He tells Cordier that Paul wants to speak to him. After mentioning how Cordier is a man of justice, Rennedon agrees to bring Paul to the Magistrates chambers the next day at noon.Paul is brought into Cordiers chambers with Rennedon present. Cordier states that he doesnt know Paul and that he didnt know his wife. Paul angrily accuses him of wanting to marry Odette. Cordier tells Paul as the guards lead him away that this stunt will not affect the court into believing that he is insane.Paul and Jeanne discuss what happened. He is surprised that Cordier can deny even knowing Odette. Jeanne tells him that Cordier would not let an innocent man be executed just to save his own reputation. Paul remarks how totally cold and inhuman Cordier seemed and how he showed no grief for the death of Odette. He thanks Jeanne and her father for their help. She tells him they dont want to lose him. He kisses her and says he wanted to when they were children. She kisses him again. He says there must be some way to prove that Cordier knew Odette.Cordier writes in his diary that he is scheduled to preside over the trial of Paul. He cannot in good conscience send an innocent man to the guillotine. He plans suicide and loads his gun. The Horla comes in and takes away the gun. When Cordier tries to retrieve it, the Horla pushes it away. He says he wont allow Cordier to kill himself. There is a knock on the door and Cordier is told to answer it.Jeanne tells Cordier that he bought a painting from her at her fathers gallery. He seems not to remember but invites her in. She insists that she has a good memory and asks why he lied about knowing Odette and Paul. She asks for the servants, saying they know Odette was in the house. He tells her they are in Switzerland. She threatens to tell the police, who will be interested in questioning them.After Jeanne leaves, the Horla tells Cordier that he must kill her. He refuses, but his eyes are seen green-tinted.Jeanne discusses her plans with Andre, who advises her not to accuse the magistrate. She insists that she will go through with it to save Paul.Cordier follows Jeanne on her way home from the gallery. Waiting in the shadows, he pulls out a knife to stab her. Suddenly the reflection of a cross from a store window reflects on the shiny blade. His eyes show green for a moment. When he comes to his right mind, he notices the cross and the knife and throws it away.Standing in front of the church, Father Raymonde comes out and questions Cordier. He asks for sanctuary and wants to confess. Suddenly both of them are almost run down by a wagon. The driver (George Sawaya) finds the reins taken out of his hands, but finally the wagon stops. He runs back to see if the Reverend is all right. Cordier tells Raymonde to tell Jeanne to come see him later at his house.Cordier writes that the Horla is now trying to kill him. There is a knock at the door. Cordier answers and gives the box with his diary in it and the letter of explanation to Jeanne. He tells the Father to take her away safely and pray for him.In the study, Cordier extinguishes all lamps but one on his desk and waits for the Horla. When it comes in through the window, it stumbles around. Cordier tells it that he knows that it fears fire (since it would not cast the painting into the fire itself). He throws the lamp against the curtains and the fire ignites and spreads through the room. The Horla runs around in panic, trying to escape the room. He is unable to open the study door which has been locked by Cordier. With screams the Horla is shown burning to death. Cordier tries to unlock the door to escape but drops the key. He tries a couple of times to retrieve it, but unsuccessfully. The house is shown completely burning.At this point we rejoin the earlier scene where the diary was being read by Andre. Jeanne presses Rennedon about Pauls innocence. He agrees that the diary clears Paul. Andre suggests that the Horla was only in the mind of Cordier, but Father Raymonde cannot deny the presence of evil in the world. He says Cordier wanted everyone to know that as long as evil exists in the heart of man, the Horla lives.

Fuad agrees to cater the party for Suzette and tells Mrs. Freemont that what he's preparing hasn't been prepared for over 5,000 years. Mrs. Freemont wants the catering done in two weeks and Fuad tells her that it will be enough time to get the last of his ingredients.

Fuad is repairing a blood rite for her in order for the goddesses resurrection. The solution that Fuad mixes in a huge vat contains the parts of the dead women.That evening, two teenagers, Tony and Marcy, make out on a nearby beach when Fuad attacks them, subduing Tony and slicing off the top of Marcy's head & removing her brain to serve as the latest ingredient. Pete Thornton arrives on the scene with the police chief where, after not getting much from the distraught Tony, interrogate Marcy's mother who can only tell Pete that her daughter belonged to a book club.At a local motel, Fuad is staking out the place when he sees a drunken sailor drop his wife off at her room before taking off. Fuad knocks on the woman's front door to the room and attacks her when she opens the door. Fuad rips the woman's tongue out of her mouth as another ingredient to his 'blood feast'. Pete continues to investigate this latest killing and also discovers that the latest murder victim also belonged to a book club too.Pete attends his weekly Egyptian studies lecture at the local university with his girlfriend, who happens to be Suzette.

Their date is interrupted by their car radio which the announcer says that another victim has been found near death. Pete drops Suzette home and races to the hospital where the police chief is there and informs him that the maniac has struck again and hacked off the face of another woman named Janet Blake. Pete questions Janet in her hospital bed, in which the woman, with a bandaged face, tells the detectives that the man who attacked her was old with gray hair, with wild eyes, wearing a funny-looking dark suite, and he said something which sounded like ""Etar"". Janet Blake then dies, while Pete can't shake the feeling why that word sounds familiar.Fuad receives a letter from Trudy requesting a copy of the book 'Ancient Weird Religious Rites', of which Ramses is the author. Fuad calls Trudy's home phone number and learns that she's staying with Suzette. That afternoon, Fuad stakes out the Freemont residence and kidnaps Trudy from the grounds and takes her to his store. He whips her savagely and collects her blood, the last ingredient of his concoction for Ishtar.With Trudy missing, Mrs. Freemont insists that the party continue. Pete calls Suzette to inform her that he will be late in arriving. Meanwhile, Fuad arrives with his food that he bakes at his store. Elsewhere, Pete calls upon the college lecturer and gets more information about the Cult of Ishtar and about the book that Fuad Ramses had wrote and figures out that Fuad is the killer since all the victims were women who personally called upon him to send them copies of his book. Pete and the police race over to Ramses' store and find Trudy's mutilated body in the back of the store. Pete tries to call Suzette to warn her, but at coincidentally the same time, Fuad cuts the phone line to the Freemont house.At the Freemont party, Fuad is ready with the food, but he first asks Suzette to come into the kitchen to help him. He has Suzette lie on a counter, which he makes his altar, and say a prayer to Ishtar, as he prepares to stab her in the chest with a butcher knife as a final offering to his goddess. Because she won't take him seriously, Ramses' attempt to sacrifice her is delayed. Dorothy Freemont interrupts Fuad just as he's about to stab Suzette, and Fuad escapes just as the police arrive.Pete and the rest of the police chase Fuad through a nearby garbage dump where Fuad attempts to escape by climbing into the back of a departing garbage truck. The truck's compact blades suddenly activate and Fuad is crushed to death. The police stop the truck and see there's not much left of Fuad Ramses as Pete puts it, ""he died a fitting end, just like the garbage he was.""","

Pete questions Janet in her hospital bed, in which the woman, with a bandaged face, tells the detectives that the man who attacked her was old with gray hair, with wild eyes, wearing a funny-looking dark suite, and he said something which sounded like ""Etar"". Janet Blake then dies, while Pete can't shake the feeling why that word sounds familiar.Fuad receives a letter from Trudy requesting a copy of the book 'Ancient Weird Religious Rites', of which Ramses is the author. Fuad calls Trudy's home phone number and learns that she's staying with Suzette. That afternoon, Fuad stakes out the Freemont residence and kidnaps Trudy from the grounds and takes her to his store. He whips her savagely and collects her blood, the last ingredient of his concoction for Ishtar.With Trudy missing, Mrs. Freemont insists that the party continue. Pete calls Suzette to inform her that he will be late in arriving. Meanwhile, Fuad arrives with his food that he bakes at his store. Elsewhere, Pete calls upon the college lecturer and gets more information about the Cult of Ishtar and about the book that Fuad Ramses had wrote and figures out that Fuad is the killer since all the victims were women who personally called upon him to send them copies of his book. Pete and the police race over to Ramses' store and find Trudy's mutilated body in the back of the store. Pete tries to call Suzette to warn her, but at coincidentally the same time, Fuad cuts the phone line to the Freemont house.At the Freemont party, Fuad is ready with the food, but he first asks Suzette to come into the kitchen to help him. He has Suzette lie on a counter, which he makes his altar, and say a prayer to Ishtar, as he prepares to stab her in the chest with a butcher knife as a final offering to his goddess. Because she won't take him seriously, Ramses' attempt to sacrifice her is delayed. Dorothy Freemont interrupts Fuad just as he's about to stab Suzette, and Fuad escapes just as the police arrive.Pete and the rest of the police chase Fuad through a nearby garbage dump where Fuad attempts to escape by climbing into the back of a departing garbage truck. The truck's compact blades suddenly activate and Fuad is crushed to death. The police stop the truck and see there's not much left of Fuad Ramses as Pete puts it, ""he died a fitting end, just like the garbage he was.""

With the support of his boss and manager of the newspaper Swanson and the orientation of the psychiatrist Dr. Fong, Johnny simulates an incestuous situation with his stripper girlfriend Cathy, who is totally against the idea, and is sent to the institution. While being submitted to a mental treatment along the weeks, he approaches the three witnesses, waiting for a moment of sanity to interview them. The former soldier Stuart tells him that the killer wore white pants; the former university black student Trent tells him that it was an attendant; and the former physicist Dr. Boden tells him the name of the killer. However, Johnny finds the price he pays for his award.

                    Journalist Johnny Barrett is out to solve a murder at an insane asylum but the only way he can do so is to have himself committed to the institution and solve the crime from the inside. He spends a full year being coached by professionals to convince psychiatrists that he is a fetishist who desires his sister sexually. Posing as his sister, his girlfriend Cathy files a complaint with the police leading to Johnny's arrest and eventual committal. Once inside he encounters a variety of mental patients but learns that there were three witnesses to the murder of the patient named Sloan. The first was Stuart who thinks he's a Confederate general. In a lucid moment he tells Johnny that the killer wore white pants, meaning the killer is either a doctor or an attendant. The second patient, Trent, is an African-American who hates blacks and in his mind is a member of the KKK. He can't identify the killer but the third witness, Boden, tells him exactly who the killer is. Unfortunately for Johnny his own mental condition has been deteriorating and is now behaving erratically, to the point that even when the doctors learn of the deception, they're not sure they can release him.

                    Daily Globe newspaper reporter Johnny Barrett has just been institutionalized at a criminal psychiatric hospital as a sexual deviant, his sister Cathy charging him with attempted incest. What the institution psychiatrists don't know is that Johnny's deviance is all made up. Johnny wanted to be committed there to solve a crime that happened at the hospital, the murder of a patient named Sloan, the resulting story which Johnny believes will win him the Pulitzer Prize. The only people who know and support Johnny in this venture are Swanee, his managing editor, psychiatrist Dr. Fong, Swanee's friend who trained Johnny for a year for this job, and Cathy, who is really his girlfriend. Cathy in reality is scared for Johnny, fearing that Johnny cannot help but be affected by the battery of tests and to what he is being exposed on a 24/7 basis as a ""crazy"" person. Despite abhorring her own job as an exotic dancer/singer, which she does because as better paying than secretarial work it will get her and Johnny to their dream faster, she still believes what she does is more respectable than this undercover work. Three patients witnessed the murder, but in their mental states have not been able to provide any useful information to the police. Johnny believes as a fellow patient he can get one or a combination of the three to a lucid enough state for them to divulge the killer to him. The question becomes if he can discover the identity of the killer either before he is found out or the institution gets the better of him.

After the service, he attempts to console a fisherman (Jonas Persson) who is tormented by anxiety, but Tomas can only speak about his own troubled relationship with God. A school teacher (Maerta Lundberg) offers Tomas her love as consolation for his loss of faith. But Tomas resists her love as desperately as she offers it to him.

On the flight from New York to Rome, Nora is befriended by a young man sitting next to her on the plane who offers her a cigarette, and she accepts. He gives her his pack as a token of appreciation. Upon arrival at the airport, the man is arrested for smuggling drugs by custom officials who recognize him as a infamous drug smuggler.Upon arrival later that afternoon at her aunt's apartment, Nora is greeted by Dr. Marcello Bassi (John Saxon). Marcello tells Nora that her aunt is very ill and that she needs absolute quite and rest. After giving her instructions in case of an emergency, the doctor leaves. Nora is obviously smitten with him.Later that same night, as a violent thunderstorm rages, Nora checks on her aunt who suddenly dies of a heart attack. After trying to phone Marcello at his house in which there is no answer, Nora flees from her aunt's apartment. On the street, Nora is attacked by a sailor-dressed purse snatcher. In the ensuing struggle with the thief, Nora is knocked unconscious. A few hours later, she is awakened by a woman's scream. To her horror, Nora looks up to see a young woman collapsing to the ground a few yards from her with a knife in her back. She also sees a strange man crouching over the dead woman's body. Nora then faints.The next morning, the soaked and unconscious Nora is discovered by a passing stranger, who attempts to awaken her by giving her some whisky. Noticing a policeman approaching, the stranger flees. The policeman notices the unconscious Nora and successfully revives her. But upon smelling liquor on her breath, the policeman immediately thinks that she's a drunk sleeping off a binge. Ranting a raving about seeing a woman killed, Nora is shocked when she sees that there is no body anywhere. With no identification on her, Nora is locked away in a hospital's lunatic asylum where she is diagnosed by a doctor an intern residents as suffering from ""delirium tremors"". Nora is soon rescued by Marcello, who happens to notice her while on his rounds.After she is released from the hospital, Nora tries to tell Marcello about what she saw. But he is skeptical, thinking that it was an hallucination brought on by double shock of her aunt's death and the subsequent attack by the purse snatcher. Convinced that she witnessed a murder, Nora plots not to give up and find the murder victim and the killer.At her aunt's funeral, Nora meets with Laura Craven-Torrani (Valentina Cortese) who introduces herself as a friend of her aunt's and she takes Nora to her house for some coffee. As she is going out of the country to visit her husband for a few days, Laura asks Nora to stay and look after her house. Nora is initially reluctant, but accepts the offer.During her first night at the house, Nora discovers a collection of old newspaper clippings. Among the articles is a story about Laura's sister, who had been brutally killed. The murder took place in the same area where she herself was attacked. The article also states that the crime was the latest in a string of so-called 'Alphabet Killings' (the first victim's last name began with the letter 'A', and then the letter 'B', and so on). Nora meets with Marcello the next day to tell him of her find and comes to two theories: first since no body was found, Nora thinks that she had a psychic vision of the killing. She might not have seen an actual killing, but the killing of Laura's sister in her mind's eyes. Second: since the last victim was named Craven, she realizes that the next victim will be somebody whose last name starts with the letter 'D', and her surname is Davis. Marcello again skeptically assures Nora that shes fretting over nothing.Meanwhile, Nora begins to receive crank phone calls. Afraid that her life is in danger, she rigs a crude burglar alarm by setting up a web of strings all along the entrance to the house. That night a policeman, who has been asked by Laura to stop by to see if everything is all right, enters and is attacked by Marcello who has been standing guard outside. The ensuing scuffle ends with the love-struck doctor falling on the burglar trap and breaking his left forefinger.Seeking to distract her from her worries, Marcello takes Nora on a trip to the various tourist sites in Rome. At the end of their day, they return to the Craven house where Nora gets another phone call. The anonymous caller tells her to go to a particular address. That evening, Nora goes to the address, which is a run-down boarding house, and is guided to a vacant room by the sound of a voice. Without realizing it, Nora has been followed by Marcello, and when he suddenly reveals himself, she hurts him once again by scratches his face, thinking him to be the killer. Together, they discover the voice to be emanating from a tape recorder. It warns Nora to leave Rome before she meets the same fate as Laura's sister. Nora and Marcello investigate and discover that the room is leased to a man named Andrea Landini (Dante Di Paolo), whom Nora recognizes as the author of the newspaper article regarding the Alphabet Killer.After several unsuccessful attempts to locate Landini, Marcello and Nora go to the beach for relaxation. Marcello's desires finally erupt and he practically forces himself on Nora. But Nora stops him by telling him that although she is interested in him too, she encourages him to wait for a more appropriate time to consummate their relationship. Upon their arrival back at the Craven house, they are shocked to discover a stranger sitting in the living room. It is Andrea Landini, who had been informed that they were inquiring about him. Landini explains that he became obsessed with finding the Alphabet Killer, and that he collaborated with the police while writing a series of articles about the killings. When the police arrested and convicted a man whom Landini knew to be innocent, he kept on writing articles, using them as a opportunity to criticize the police for jumping to the wrong conclusions. He soon lost his job at the newspaper, but he continued to investigate the matter. Landini also explains that he was the one who tried to revived with her whisky, and he believes her to be the mostly likely target for the killer. Because of this, he has been following her ever since. Though Marcello is distrustful of him, Nora agrees to collaborate with Landini. Nora's teaming with Landini finds them venturing across Rome inquiring about the first two alphabet victims and of their connection to one another. But the results only lead to dead ends.The following day, Nora goes to meet with Landini at his apartment. She is perplexed to find that the apparent sounds of typing are actually emanating from Landinis tape recorder. When she finds a photo of herself labeled 'Fourth Victim', she becomes convinced that he is the killer. However, the matter seems to resolve itself when she finds Landinis body, an apparent suicide, with a note of confession by his side.That same day, Laura returns to Rome from her trip abroad. Nora and Marcello plan to go to America the following morning, and she agrees to spend one more night in the Craven house. Then Nora reads the daily newspaper where the body of a young woman was found, and she recognizes it as the murdered woman she saw that night. After identifying it at the morgue, Nora begins to realize that she may have indeed witnessed the killing after all.That night, when Laura is apparently out, Nora notices that the study door is open. Especially since Laura had earlier remarked on her husband instance that the room be locked at all times. Nora cannot resist the temptation to enter the room. In the study, Nora notices an adjoining door, and s sliver of light shining thought the bottom. Upon opening the door, she sees a man rising uncomfortably from his chair. Nora recognizes him as the same man standing over the dead body of the woman from that night. He then walks towards Nora, and collapses to the floor with a knife in his back. Nora attempts to flee, but is prevented by Laura. No longer acting like the good-natured woman as previously seen, the crazed and wild-eyed Laura confesses to the killings and explains that she just stabbed her husband because of his attempts to turn her over to the police. Laura reveals that the alphabet system is all a hoax meant to cover up the real motivation: the desire to steal her sister's money compelled her to murder. The trill of killing has apparently warped her mind, and Laura is now completely deranged. Before she can kill Nora, Laura is suddenly shot dead by her husband through the study door.In the final comic scene, Nora is happily reunited with Marcello. Marcello asks Nora for a cigarette, but after she gives him one, she is reminded of an important incident. The pack of cigarettes that Nora accepted on the plane to Italy in the opening scene were laced with a marijuana and cocaine combination. On the night of her aunt's death, Nora smoked a few of these cigarettes, and consequently she had interpreted the situation incorrectly. Though she witnessed an actual killing, her blurred memory confused the facts. The man she saw at the scene was Laura's husband, but he was not the killer. He was merely disposing of the body of the woman that Laura stabbed. When Nora comes to realize this, she takes the lighted cigarette away from Marcello and crushes it, saying that it's about time they both gave up smoking. She takes the pack of cigarettes and pitched it over the balcony where they are. The tainted pack of cigarettes are picked up by a passing priest who takes one out to light it up.","

    Synopsis
    Nora Davis (Leticia Roman) is a young, sexually frustrated American woman who journeys to Rome, Italy to visit her elderly Aunt Edith. On the flight from New York to Rome, Nora is befriended by a young man sitting next to her on the plane who offers her a cigarette, and she accepts. He gives her his pack as a token of appreciation. Upon arrival at the airport, the man is arrested for smuggling drugs by custom officials who recognize him as a infamous drug smuggler.Upon arrival later that afternoon at her aunt's apartment, Nora is greeted by Dr. Marcello Bassi (John Saxon). Marcello tells Nora that her aunt is very ill and that she needs absolute quite and rest. After giving her instructions in case of an emergency, the doctor leaves. Nora is obviously smitten with him.Later that same night, as a violent thunderstorm rages, Nora checks on her aunt who suddenly dies of a heart attack. After trying to phone Marcello at his house in which there is no answer, Nora flees from her aunt's apartment. On the street, Nora is attacked by a sailor-dressed purse snatcher. In the ensuing struggle with the thief, Nora is knocked unconscious. A few hours later, she is awakened by a woman's scream. To her horror, Nora looks up to see a young woman collapsing to the ground a few yards from her with a knife in her back. She also sees a strange man crouching over the dead woman's body. Nora then faints.The next morning, the soaked and unconscious Nora is discovered by a passing stranger, who attempts to awaken her by giving her some whisky. Noticing a policeman approaching, the stranger flees. The policeman notices the unconscious Nora and successfully revives her. But upon smelling liquor on her breath, the policeman immediately thinks that she's a drunk sleeping off a binge. Ranting a raving about seeing a woman killed, Nora is shocked when she sees that there is no body anywhere. With no identification on her, Nora is locked away in a hospital's lunatic asylum where she is diagnosed by a doctor an intern residents as suffering from ""delirium tremors"". Nora is soon rescued by Marcello, who happens to notice her while on his rounds.After she is released from the hospital, Nora tries to tell Marcello about what she saw. But he is skeptical, thinking that it was an hallucination brought on by double shock of her aunt's death and the subsequent attack by the purse snatcher. Convinced that she witnessed a murder, Nora plots not to give up and find the murder victim and the killer.At her aunt's funeral, Nora meets with Laura Craven-Torrani (Valentina Cortese) who introduces herself as a friend of her aunt's and she takes Nora to her house for some coffee. As she is going out of the country to visit her husband for a few days, Laura asks Nora to stay and look after her house. Nora is initially reluctant, but accepts the offer.During her first night at the house, Nora discovers a collection of old newspaper clippings. Among the articles is a story about Laura's sister, who had been brutally killed. The murder took place in the same area where she herself was attacked. The article also states that the crime was the latest in a string of so-called 'Alphabet Killings' (the first victim's last name began with the letter 'A', and then the letter 'B', and so on). Nora meets with Marcello the next day to tell him of her find and comes to two theories: first since no body was found, Nora thinks that she had a psychic vision of the killing. She might not have seen an actual killing, but the killing of Laura's sister in her mind's eyes. Second: since the last victim was named Craven, she realizes that the next victim will be somebody whose last name starts with the letter 'D', and her surname is Davis. Marcello again skeptically assures Nora that shes fretting over nothing.Meanwhile, Nora begins to receive crank phone calls. Afraid that her life is in danger, she rigs a crude burglar alarm by setting up a web of strings all along the entrance to the house. That night a policeman, who has been asked by Laura to stop by to see if everything is all right, enters and is attacked by Marcello who has been standing guard outside. The ensuing scuffle ends with the love-struck doctor falling on the burglar trap and breaking his left forefinger.Seeking to distract her from her worries, Marcello takes Nora on a trip to the various tourist sites in Rome. At the end of their day, they return to the Craven house where Nora gets another phone call. The anonymous caller tells her to go to a particular address. That evening, Nora goes to the address, which is a run-down boarding house, and is guided to a vacant room by the sound of a voice. Without realizing it, Nora has been followed by Marcello, and when he suddenly reveals himself, she hurts him once again by scratches his face, thinking him to be the killer. Together, they discover the voice to be emanating from a tape recorder. It warns Nora to leave Rome before she meets the same fate as Laura's sister. Nora and Marcello investigate and discover that the room is leased to a man named Andrea Landini (Dante Di Paolo), whom Nora recognizes as the author of the newspaper article regarding the Alphabet Killer.After several unsuccessful attempts to locate Landini, Marcello and Nora go to the beach for relaxation. Marcello's desires finally erupt and he practically forces himself on Nora. But Nora stops him by telling him that although she is interested in him too, she encourages him to wait for a more appropriate time to consummate their relationship. Upon their arrival back at the Craven house, they are shocked to discover a stranger sitting in the living room. It is Andrea Landini, who had been informed that they were inquiring about him. Landini explains that he became obsessed with finding the Alphabet Killer, and that he collaborated with the police while writing a series of articles about the killings. When the police arrested and convicted a man whom Landini knew to be innocent, he kept on writing articles, using them as a opportunity to criticize the police for jumping to the wrong conclusions. He soon lost his job at the newspaper, but he continued to investigate the matter. Landini also explains that he was the one who tried to revived with her whisky, and he believes her to be the mostly likely target for the killer. Because of this, he has been following her ever since. Though Marcello is distrustful of him, Nora agrees to collaborate with Landini. Nora's teaming with Landini finds them venturing across Rome inquiring about the first two alphabet victims and of their connection to one another. But the results only lead to dead ends.The following day, Nora goes to meet with Landini at his apartment. She is perplexed to find that the apparent sounds of typing are actually emanating from Landinis tape recorder. When she finds a photo of herself labeled 'Fourth Victim', she becomes convinced that he is the killer. However, the matter seems to resolve itself when she finds Landinis body, an apparent suicide, with a note of confession by his side.That same day, Laura returns to Rome from her trip abroad. Nora and Marcello plan to go to America the following morning, and she agrees to spend one more night in the Craven house. Then Nora reads the daily newspaper where the body of a young woman was found, and she recognizes it as the murdered woman she saw that night. After identifying it at the morgue, Nora begins to realize that she may have indeed witnessed the killing after all.That night, when Laura is apparently out, Nora notices that the study door is open. Especially since Laura had earlier remarked on her husband instance that the room be locked at all times. Nora cannot resist the temptation to enter the room. In the study, Nora notices an adjoining door, and s sliver of light shining thought the bottom. Upon opening the door, she sees a man rising uncomfortably from his chair. Nora recognizes him as the same man standing over the dead body of the woman from that night. He then walks towards Nora, and collapses to the floor with a knife in his back. Nora attempts to flee, but is prevented by Laura. No longer acting like the good-natured woman as previously seen, the crazed and wild-eyed Laura confesses to the killings and explains that she just stabbed her husband because of his attempts to turn her over to the police. Laura reveals that the alphabet system is all a hoax meant to cover up the real motivation: the desire to steal her sister's money compelled her to murder. The trill of killing has apparently warped her mind, and Laura is now completely deranged. Before she can kill Nora, Laura is suddenly shot dead by her husband through the study door.In the final comic scene, Nora is happily reunited with Marcello. Marcello asks Nora for a cigarette, but after she gives him one, she is reminded of an important incident. The pack of cigarettes that Nora accepted on the plane to Italy in the opening scene were laced with a marijuana and cocaine combination. On the night of her aunt's death, Nora smoked a few of these cigarettes, and consequently she had interpreted the situation incorrectly. Though she witnessed an actual killing, her blurred memory confused the facts. The man she saw at the scene was Laura's husband, but he was not the killer. He was merely disposing of the body of the woman that Laura stabbed. When Nora comes to realize this, she takes the lighted cigarette away from Marcello and crushes it, saying that it's about time they both gave up smoking. She takes the pack of cigarettes and pitched it over the balcony where they are. The tainted pack of cigarettes are picked up by a passing priest who takes one out to light it up.

He smugly assures her that he feels her pain, as he is interested in Nevenka. Katia flees from this unwanted revelation.

Kurt explains that now he has returned home, he feels that he deserves to be next in line to inherit the family estate. But the Count assures him that there is no chance of that happening.

He then calmly takes it out of her hand and pushes her to the ground. Cracking the riding crop across her back, he sneers: ""You haven't changed, I see. You've always loved violence"". He then proceeds to strike her again and again. Nevenka's reactions to being beaten are very subdued and the expression her face suggests sexual excitement. After striking her several more times, Kurt tosses the riding crop aside and proceeds to rape her.After finishing with Nevenka, Kurt returns to the castle where he is confronted by Katia and Christian who ask him where Nevenka is, to which Kurt replies that he has no idea.

The family butler, Losat (Luciano Pigozzi), goes to fetch Kurt, only to discover his dead body on the floor, with the dagger lying beside him. Losat's screams bring the others into the room, where Giorgia is hysterical with joy to see him dead, killed by the same dagger her daughter used to commit suicide.After Kurt's funeral, Christian timidly asks his father if he was responsible for the killing. The Count is enraged by these accusations, and tells his son to leave the living room. Soon after, the entire family unit begins to unravel. The marriage between Christian and Nevenka becomes more strained. Nevenka starts to see visions of Kurt. At one point, his ghost visits her in the middle of the night, whipping her more ferocious than ever.Soon afterwards, the Count is found murdered in the living room in the same fashion as Kurt, with the same weapon. Christian vows to find the killer, and Katia accuses Giorgia, pointing out that she had every motive to kill Kurt. Giorgia admits that she wanted to kill Kurt, but assures everybody that her love for the Count would have made it impossible for her to kill him. Elsewhere, Nevenka's mind becomes more unhinged and each nightmarish vision of Kurt unsettles her ever further. After explaining everything to Christian, even he comes to believe that Kurt may have been behind the murder of their father, and that his ghost is doing all the killing.Christian and Loast unearth Kurt's decaying dead body from the family crypt and burn the remains to try to put Kurt to rest. As they watch Kurt's remains burn, the dead man's sinister laughter rings out. Following a cloaked figured dressed as Kurt, Christian and Loast follow it to the castle where Christian pulls off the hood to reveals none other than Nevenka. At last the terrible truth comes out: Nevenka was the one who murdered Kurt after sneaking back into the castle and sneaking out through hidden passageways. But at her remorse over the crime, coupled by the realization that she really did love Kurt, compelled her to act out as if he is still alive, by dressing in his clothes to complement the illusion. Nevenka even went as far as to whip her self during those nights, and murdered her father as revenge for his ostracizing her love.Nevenka escapes from her husband, stabbing him in the arm in the process, and makes her way back to the crypt. Now really believing that Kurt is alive, Nevenka decides to put a stop to it all by killing him again.

The family butler, Losat (Luciano Pigozzi), goes to fetch Kurt, only to discover his dead body on the floor, with the dagger lying beside him. Losat's screams bring the others into the room, where Giorgia is hysterical with joy to see him dead, killed by the same dagger her daughter used to commit suicide.After Kurt's funeral, Christian timidly asks his father if he was responsible for the killing. The Count is enraged by these accusations, and tells his son to leave the living room. Soon after, the entire family unit begins to unravel. The marriage between Christian and Nevenka becomes more strained. Nevenka starts to see visions of Kurt. At one point, his ghost visits her in the middle of the night, whipping her more ferocious than ever.Soon afterwards, the Count is found murdered in the living room in the same fashion as Kurt, with the same weapon. Christian vows to find the killer, and Katia accuses Giorgia, pointing out that she had every motive to kill Kurt. Giorgia admits that she wanted to kill Kurt, but assures everybody that her love for the Count would have made it impossible for her to kill him. Elsewhere, Nevenka's mind becomes more unhinged and each nightmarish vision of Kurt unsettles her ever further. After explaining everything to Christian, even he comes to believe that Kurt may have been behind the murder of their father, and that his ghost is doing all the killing.Christian and Loast unearth Kurt's decaying dead body from the family crypt and burn the remains to try to put Kurt to rest. As they watch Kurt's remains burn, the dead man's sinister laughter rings out. Following a cloaked figured dressed as Kurt, Christian and Loast follow it to the castle where Christian pulls off the hood to reveals none other than Nevenka. At last the terrible truth comes out: Nevenka was the one who murdered Kurt after sneaking back into the castle and sneaking out through hidden passageways. But at her remorse over the crime, coupled by the realization that she really did love Kurt, compelled her to act out as if he is still alive, by dressing in his clothes to complement the illusion. Nevenka even went as far as to whip her self during those nights, and murdered her father as revenge for his ostracizing her love.Nevenka escapes from her husband, stabbing him in the arm in the process, and makes her way back to the crypt. Now really believing that Kurt is alive, Nevenka decides to put a stop to it all by killing him again. Kurt appears to her for a final time where in their final 'embrace' she stabs him, but instead stabs herself in the chest with the dagger, and she falls dead.

                    Three years into their loving marriage, with two infant daughters at home in Los Angeles, Nicholas Arden and Ellen Wagstaff Arden are on a plane that goes down in the South Pacific. Although most passengers manage to survive the incident, Ellen presumably perishes when swept off her lifeboat, her body never recovered. Fast forward five years. Nicky, wanting to move on with his life, has Ellen declared legally dead. Part of that moving on includes getting remarried, this time to a young woman named Bianca Steele, who, for their honeymoon, he plans to take to the same Monterey resort where he and Ellen spent their honeymoon. On that very same day, Ellen is dropped off in Los Angeles by the Navy, who rescued her from the South Pacific island where she was stranded for the past five years. She asks the Navy not to publicize her rescue nor notify Nicky as she wants to do so herself. Upon arrival back home, a shocked Grace Arden (Nicky's mother) informs Ellen that Nicky just got remarried that morning and that Ellen, his true wife (as opposed to Bianca, his new bride), should go to Monterey to tell Nicky she's alive. She does, and Nicky is equally as shocked as his mother at seeing Ellen alive, but it places him in a difficult position. Although he loves Ellen and wants more than anything to be with her, he has Bianca's feelings to take into consideration. As such, he finds it difficult to tell Bianca, who is in a honeymoon amorous mood. Nicky's inability to tell Bianca irks Ellen, who believes it is a manifestation of his love for Bianca over her. Nicky, however, ends up with questions of his own about Ellen's faithfulness and love for him when he learns that Ellen was not all alone on that island but stranded with a handsome man named Stephen Burkett (with whom the two nicknamed each other Adam and Eve). Nicky's questions about her faithfulness increase when she purposefully withholds information about Stephen from him.

                    It's the early twentieth century. Upon the death of her well-bred husband, Margaret Carey of Boston, Massachusetts is forced to sell many of the family's belongings and move into a smaller house, a dreary one which she has found in town, and only then will they barely be able to make ends meet on a much reduced budget. However, the eldest of her three children, teenager Nancy Carey, has made inquiries into the availability of ""the yellow house"" in Beulah, Maine, which the family fell in love with when they were there on a vacation years ago. The house at the time was empty, apparently still is, and is renting for a pittance according to Ostia Popham - Osh - the local mercantilist acting on behalf of the property owner, Tom Hamilton. Mr. Hamilton inherited the house from his father, and now lives in China. Sight unseen, soft-hearted Osh rents them the house based on the ""tug at the heartstrings"" story Nancy told to him via their correspondence. Despite that story not totally being true, Osh falls in love with the Careys once they arrive in Beulah so as to keep to the verbal agreement. In fact, he offers them one concession after another, including that they can live there rent-free in lieu of the repairs and decorating they will do to make the house their own, with Osh even throwing in much of his own free labor. What Osh has failed to tell them is that not only has he not cleared any of these issues with Mr. Hamilton, but he hasn't even told Mr. Hamilton he has rented the house. The transition to country life has enough challenges for some of the Careys, which is made even more challenging with: the addition of an inherited old English sheepdog; the arrival of their cousin Julia Carey, a stuck-up young woman who the Carey children do not much like but who is not to be told of the unfortunate circumstances behind her needing to live with them; and Nancy just entering young womanhood, she who is as attracted to Charles Bryant, the dashing new schoolteacher, as any young woman in town. Things get even more complicated with the unexpected arrival back into town of Tom Hamilton...

Kennedy is an able commander who quickly gains the confidence and loyalty of his men. While on patrol on a dark and moonless night, the PT boat is cut in half after being struck by a Japanese destroyer.

                    Solomon Islands, 1943. US forces are slowly pushing the Japanese out of the region. Short of larger warships, and suited to the shallow, narrow waters of the Solomons, the US Navy is heavily reliant on Patrol Torpedo (PT) boats to harry the enemy and perform all manner of other duties. One such boat is PT-109. Based on a (mostly) true story, here we see PT-109's exploits in the Solomons campaign, especially one incident for which it would become famous. Moreover, the movie focuses on the exploits and derring-do of PT-109's commander, Lt (jg) John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

                    A young British clerk in a gloomy North Country undertaker's office, Billy is bombarded daily by the propaganda of the media that all things are for the asking. This transparently false doctrine, coupled with the humdrum job and his wild imagination, leads him on frequent flights to ""Ambrosia,"" a mythical kingdom where he is crowned king, general, lover or any idealized hero the real situation of the moment makes him desire. His vacillating commitment and post-adolescent immaturity have created situations which make Ambrosia all the more attractive. He's succeeded in becoming engaged to two different girls, simultaneously, while in love with a third, Liz. He's in hot water with his employer, having spent a rather large sum of postage money on his personal frivolities. And last, but not least, his dream of becoming a highly-paid, famous scriptwriter in London seems doomed to failure. The only person in his life capable of bringing him down to earth is Liz, and she's having a difficult time of it. Finally, he gets his life sufficiently in order to leave for London with his true love. Billy still hasn't come to grips with the real world by the end of the film. He leaves the train to buy milk from a vending machine and watches the train slowly pull out for London with Liz aboard. He returns to the more comfortable shelter of his parents home, Ambrosia and his imagination.

                    Psychologist Dr. Matthew Clark is the head of the Crawthorne State Training Institute, one of the first boarding schools for developmentally challenged children. Dr. Clark is sympathetic but demanding of his teachers and students. His approach of tough love is controversial. He takes a chance at hiring former aspiring concert pianist Jean Hansen as the school's music teacher, Miss Hansen who has no background in nursing, teaching or dealing with the developmentally challenged. She herself is trying to find her own place in life. She immediately bonds with autistic student Reuben Widdicombe, who she sees as needing special attention in light of his parents having not visited him since they enrolled him in the school two years earlier. The Widdicombes divorced shortly thereafter because of the pressures their relationship faced in dealing with Reuben. Dr. Clark sees Reuben as the type of child the most difficult with which to deal: Reuben understands just enough to realize that he is different and is often being rejected. Miss Hansen and Dr. Clark disagree on how best to get through to Reuben. Although Dr. Clark admits that his methods have not worked with Reuben, he also does not believe that Miss Hansen's approach of undivided attention is the answer. Through getting to know the Widdicombe's reasons for not visiting and she herself seeing the life of the adult disabled, Miss Hansen comes to an understanding of how she feels she can best help her students, Reuben included.

Claude and Denise Marceau sharing the prize for chemistry, while their marriage is basically non-existent, Claude's mistress Monique Souvir, about who Denise knows, openly traveling with them as his secretary; American Dr. Max Stratman awarded the prize for physics, he who is accompanied by his now adult niece Emily Stratman who he has not seen since she was a child and who may not know that he is being strong armed to defect back to his homeland of East Germany against his will; and American Andrew Craig awarded the prize for literature, despite his six novels to date not having sold well, he having not written anything in five years, he having disdain for the award itself except the prize money, and he being more renowned for his excessive lifestyle, especially with booze and women. As Craig is traveling by himself, the Swedish foreign office has assigned him a personal aide, the beautiful Inger Lisa Andersson, whose biggest job is to make sure he doesn't embarrass himself or by association the Nobel name. At a press conference, Craig admits that he of late has been making a living writing pulp fiction detective novels under a pseudonym. His detective skills are put to the test when he gets embroiled in his fellow Nobel laureates' back issues, most specifically Dr. Stratman's. In the process, he has to convince Miss Andersson, with who he is falling in love, of what he discovers, which includes a dead body, his own life in danger, and the kidnapping of Dr. Stratman, despite Dr. Stratman seemingly attending all the Nobel functions.

Eileen's visit has actually placed a crimp in his plans to spend a sex-filled day with his primary girlfriend, Mona Harris. Being on call may also factor into how Adam spends his day with or without Mona. Regardless of Adam's advice, Eileen decides that she's going to attempt to seduce a stranger while in New York leading to her first sexual experience. Despite the rocky start they have, she thinks that person is Mike Mitchell, a Philadelphia based music critic who was in New York for the day to meet up with a woman, who ultimately stood him up. As Eileen and Mike's relationship goes through its ups and downs during the day, Eileen's decision to seduce Mike may hit a road bump when Russ unexpectedly comes into New York to reconcile with Eileen. Russ comes to his own wrong conclusions about who Mike is in Eileen's life. Russ, Eileen and Mike ultimately have to decide what is important in their respective dating lives.

                    The history starts with the main character (an old executioner in the Spain of early 60's) approaching retirement age. As his profession is not exactly what you could call ""popular"", he (a very gentle and nice man, caring, and proud of traditions) begins to worry about who might take his place when he retires. He has a daughter, but, unfortunately, she seems doomed to perpetual ""spinsterhood"": as soon as any prospective groom learns about her dad and her dad's ""trade"", he runs away from her, scared. A sad life... However, a new character enters: the local undertaker, a handsome and young man who has exactly the same problem... No girl wants him given his profession. So, you have the woman whom almost nobody would marry and the man whom almost nobody would marry. Obviously, they are meant for each other. But here the old executioner has something to say: He does not object to her daughter marrying the young undertaker; he seems a decent man, and all that... But there is a condition: Only if the groom agrees to take the executioner's job when he will retire, will he agree to her daughter's marriage. And, anyway, as the old executioner says to the worried young man.... ""Don't worry, they sentence people, but, in the last moment, they're going to pardon them!"".

As the man in our history retires, his place is vacant. His son doesn't like at all becoming an executioner, but that is the only way to keep the house where he is going to live after getting married. Anyway, executions are not very common, maybe he doesn't have to kill anyone.

                    La historia comienza con Amadeo, el personaje principal. Es un viejo verdugo de la España de principios de los 60 a punto de jubilarse. Ya que su profesión no es exactamente lo que podríamos llamar ""popular"", él, un hombre gentil, agradable, cariñoso y amante de las tradiciones, empieza a preocuparse por quién ocupará su lugar tras su jubilación. Tiene una hija, Carmen, pero ésta, por desventura, parece abocada a la soltería perpetua: tan pronto como sus pretendientes conocen el ""negocio"" de su padre, huyen de ella, despavoridos. Una triste vida, ciertamente... No obstante, aparece ahora en la historia un nuevo personaje: José Luis, el enterrador local, un apuesto joven que tiene exactamente el mismo problema que Carmen: ninguna chica se acerca a él debido a su profesión. Así, tenemos a la mujer con la que casi nadie querría casarse y al hombre con el que casi nadie querría casarse. Obviamente, están hechos el uno para el otro, y se enamoran. Cierto día ocurre ""lo que tenía que ocurrir""... y no tienen más remedio que casarse cuanto antes. Para poder mantener a la nueva familia (en la que ahora está incluido el recién jubilado suegro), José Luis deberá relevar a Amadeo en el oficio de verdugo, cosa que le pone los pelos de punta tan sólo de pensarlo. Pero no hay por qué preocuparse, ya que, como dice Amadeo, ""sentencian a la gente, pero en el último momento casi siempre les perdonan la vida...""

In Boston, he must decide whether to save the life of his sister or her unborn child, conceived out of wedlock. In Austria, he confronts the question of whether to remain with the priesthood or abandon his oath so that he can be with the woman he loves.

Annette's stepmother Eve, played by Nadia Gray, gradually shifts the young man's attentions to herself, rather than her stepdaughter, and together Eve and Jeff concoct a plot to help free Eve's estranged husband from the institution in which he's been confined as a homicidal maniac these past four years after committing the so-called ""Acetylene Murder"", when he killed with a blowtorch the man who raped Annette. The idea is that Georges, the husband, will leave the country, but, unknown to Jeff, it's not Georges who escapes but Henri, the guard who has become Eve's lover . . .

Georges Beynat, Eve's husband, has been in an insane asylum for the past four years for blow-torching to death a man who raped his daughter, Annette. At first, Paul is interested in Annette, but Eve easily manipulates Paul into helping her husband Georges escape from the insane asylum by pretending that she loves Paul and wants to go away with him. With Paul and Eve's help, Georges escapes -- or the man Jeff assumes is Georges -- but instead of leaving the country as he had promised he plans to murder Jeff and be with Eve. As Inspector Etienne becomes suspicious, we discover that the man who escaped is not Georges Beynat at all, but rather Henri, a male nurse at the asylum, who has fallen in love with Eve Beynat during her visits to her husband. Henri has killed Georges Beynat, and now plans to kill Annette, who wants to tell the cops everything she knows. Eve lures Annette to a rock quarry, where Henri waits for her.

Late in the evening, the boss, Fernand Naudin (Lino Ventura), takes his car to go to Paris on some urgent matter. Which bothers his assistant because of the annual Fair on the next week-end.Early in the morning, Fernand arrives in Paris on the Champs-Elysées, to meet his old friend, Louis (Jacques Dumesnil), who just came back from Mexico, where he had gone fifteen years before, to get away from French justice. They remained very close friends, even after Fernand change to legal business. The meeting place is a bowling alley, where Fernand is met by another friend of Louis, Henri (Paul Mercey), the manager of the place.In an apartment above the bowling alley, Louis is lying in bed, where a doctor is giving him a shot. After the doctor is gone, Louis explains Fernand that he is very ill, and that he came back to France do die and be buried next to his parents. He also tells Fernand about his 18-year old daughter, Patricia, whose mother was a hooker friend of him, and whom he would like Fernand to take care of after his death. Money is no problem, since Louis has several not quite legal business, but which work very smoothly, and which get enough money for Patricia's needs. Nevertheless Fernand is not very happy about the idea.Their heated conversation is stopped by the arrival of Louis' assistants, Raoul (Bertrand Blier) and Paul (Jean Lefebvre) Volfoni, who run a clandestine and illegal roulette on a barge, and Théo (Horst Frank), who runs an illegal distillery. Théo, who is homosexual, has come with his boyfriend, Vincent (Georges Nojaroff), whom Louis doesn't want to be present. Louis tells the three remaining men that Fernand is now in charge of his business, which doesn't seem to please Raoul Volfoni. But Pascal (Valentino Venantini), Louis' gunman, being around, neither the Volfoni brothers nor Théo don't say much about it.After they're gone, Fernand remains alone with Louis. When Louis has an attack, Fernand calls Pascal to help him and Louis dies in both men's arms.After Louis' death, Fernand goes back in the bowling alley, where Henri gets him something to eat. The Volfoni brothers try to talk Fernand out of taking over Louis' business, but Fernand refuses not to keep a promise made to a dying friend. Their conversation is interrupted by a phone call from Tomate, who runs a illegal roulette in a farm. Tomate seems to have some problem with nervous patrons. Pascal wants to have a look and Fernand asks him to go with him. After their departure, Théo, who, unlike the Volfoni, didn't say a word to Fernand, tells Vincent, his boyfriend, that he has just taken care of Fernand as a problem.Pascal and Fernand reach the farm, but they've just left their car when they get machine-gunned from a gunman in a big American car. Pascal kills both the gunman and the driver, and then goes inside the farm, followed by a slightly disturbed Fernand, who wonders if the Volfoni are not the sponsors of the dead gunman. Pascal agrees with him.Tomate (Charles Régnier), alone in the roulette room, seems very surprised by what Pascal and Fernand tell him. He sends his henchman, Freddy (Henri Cogan), to clean the mess made by the gun fight, and then he explains to Fernand that he had no problem that evening in the roulette room, and consequently that he never phoned the bowling alley. But when Fernand phones the bowling alley, he learns that Henri has been shot and killed, and that the police is already there.Pascal drives Fernand to the 18th century manor that Louis had bought for his daughter, who lives there with her two «uncles», Folace (Francis Blanche), who is a shady attorney in charge of Louis' business, and Jean (Robert Dalban), who is a former burglar, adopted by Louis, and converted into a butler. Pascal goes back home and Folace explains to Fernand that Patricia is a bit of a problem, because she consistently gets kicked out of every private school she goes to. Fernand, who wants to get back to Montauban as soon as possible, tells Folace that he is going to make Patricia understand how she must behave. Folace also tells Jean and Fernand that Patricia must never know that her father, whom she knows only through his letters, is dead.Next morning, Fernand is shaving when Patricia (Sabine Sinjen) enters the bathroom. She teases Fernand, whom her father, in his letters, describes as some sort of modern knight. When Fernand tells her they must have a serious conversation, she gets away.A bit later, Folace tells Fernand that Louis' business is not running as smoothly as he thought, and even less since Louis' «assistants» learned about his death.Fernand then meets Patricia's fiancé, Antoine Delafoy (Claude Rich), a musical genius or so he pretends himself to be ! Actually he is a very smart young man, a bit eccentric, and who keeps on talking all the time, to Fernand's obvious annoyance.Pascal discreetly interrupts Fernand's conversation with Antoine, to tell him that Louis' «assistants» are holding a secret meeting on the Volfoni's barge. Fernand feels like going to see what it's all about, along with the very efficient Pascal. Antoine doesn't believe in Fernand's unexpected board meeting, and thinks Fernand is going to meet some girl !Around the roulette table inside the barge, are gathered the Volfoni brothers, Théo, Vincent, Tomate, Freddy, and Madame Mado (Dominique Davray) who runs an illegal brothel. Raoul is trying to get them to do something about the situation, but Théo objects that, since Louis' death, there have been too many murders around.On the barge deck, Fernand, Pascal and Folace are met by Léo, who is the barge «official» skipper. When Léo says he wants to ask the Volfoni before letting his visitors inside the barge, Fernand punches him and sends him into the river.In the roulette room, the meeting is very heated, when someone knocks at the door. Freddy opens the door and gets Fernand's fist in his face. Pascal walks in behind Fernand with a gun in each hand. Bastien (Marc Ronay), Volfoni's gunman, wants to react, but Raoul stops him.Fernand sits down, and, with the help of Folace, goes on with important matters. He asks Mado about the irregular management of her brothel. She defends her business with quite a sense of humor. Fernand turns to Théo, who talks about his problems with illegal alcohol.Meanwhile, in a small room near the entrance of the roulette room, the two gunmen, Pascal and Bastien, are talking shop and showing each other's guns.After Théo's, Fernand opens the Volfoni's file. He explains he has decided to make their bookkeeping much easier : he will just ask them to pay this year what they paid the year before. He then asks Pascal to come and get their money during the coming week.Fernand and friends leave the room with Bastien. After they've gone, Mado makes fun of Raoul, whom she finds a bit of a coward. Raoul gets very angry when she says that. Then someone knocks at the door and he crosses the room to open it. He gets Fernand's fist in his face. Fernand tells him that he gives him an extra ten percent on his debt because of the delay.Back to the manor, Fernand finds Patricia and Antoine seated close to each other on a sofa, listening to Corelli in the dark. He sends Patricia to her room and Antoine out of the house.Later in the evening, Fernand is listening to the Corelli record while eating some chicken, when Pascal and Bastien enter discreetly through a French window. The two gunmen explain to Fernand that they've found they are related, and the dispute between Fernand and the Volfoni is giving them a moral dilemma. They are afraid that, one day, they will have to face each other, guns in hand. So Bastien has just resigned his job with the Volfoni and Pascal is doing the same with Fernand.A few days later, Fernand is reading a dissertation Patricia wrote about Corneille, Racine, Bossuet and Pascal. He finds it so good that he thinks that the teacher could have given her a higher grade. He is interrupted by a call from one of his assistants in Montauban.A few moments later, Folace explains to Fernand that the expected money didn't come in when he gets interrupted by a call from Raoul, who tells him there are some problem at the distillery.At the distillery, Tomate asks Théo if he thinks Fernand believed what they suggested the too naïve Raoul to tell him. The answer is the noise made by Fernand's car arriving at the distillery. Théo explains to Tomate and Freddy that, after they get rid of Fernand, they will just have to get also rid of the Volfoni brothers, and then they will be the only bosses of the late Louis' business.After he has sent his assistants on their duties, Théo greets Fernand with a feigned surprise. He explains to Fernand that his problem is that he just lost the driver who was supposed to drive a truck full of moonshine (illegal alcohol), and because he, Théo, doesn't have a driver's license anymore, he asked Raoul to get him a new driver. Fernand tells him he is going to drive the truck himself.To reach the «meeting place», Fernand has to cross the Fontainebleau forest. This is where Théo and Tomate are waiting for him with a machine-gun. They shoot the truck, which gets off the road, and then starts burning. Fernand succeeds in leaving the truck, and with a burned and torn suit, he reaches the Volfoni barge.There, he knocks Raoul out, and then empty the open safe. Paul Volfoni, who does not understand a word of what Fernand tells him about trucks and moonshine, nevertheless lets the very angry Fernand takes the money out of the safe.When Fernand gets back at the manor with his bag full of money, it is to find that his «niece» Patricia is having a party where she invited a lot of young idle «bourgeois». Many sport cars are parked in front of the manor. When one of the owners of one of these sport cars says something quite inappropriate about the relationship between Patricia and Antoine, Fernand feels he has to give the young guy a good thrashing.He then enters the manor, where all the young guests are dancing while Jean is moving around them with a tray full of drinks. Fernand has a little chat with Patricia, and then goes to the kitchen.In the kitchen, Folace is buttering toasts for the guests. Fernand shows him the money inside the bag. When Jean sees Fernand torn suit, and when Fernand tells him it is the work of the Volfoni, Jean puts a gun in his pocket.A quite useful decision when, a few minutes later, the Volfoni brothers enter the manor. Jean guide them to the kitchen, where they get in, gun in hand. Jean comes in behind them, pointing his own gun in their backs, and he asks them to give him their guns. Paul, to calm the situation down, start buttering the toasts. A very drunk girl enters the kitchen, because she is looking for a drink. When she takes some money in the bag to buy drinks, Folace is so aggressive with her that she goes out very quickly.Raoul says he would like very much to share a drink with his friends, but Folace tells him that the kid have drunk everything in the house, and that the only bottle left is an old bottle of moonshine whisky. Even those tough men find it a bit strange to drink, and get drunk very quickly.Meanwhile, Antoine is telling Patricia he feels like telling «uncle Fernand» about their love.Back in the kitchen, all the men are completely drunk. Raoul feels like visiting the bathroom very urgently, and rushes out of the kitchen.When Raoul goes out of the bathroom, he feels better, even though he is still drunk, and he starts flirting with Patricia, offering to give her a «job» in Egypt. Patricia knows very well what kind of a job he means, but Antoine doesn't find it very funny.Back in the kitchen, Raoul tells Fernand about the «inappropriate» jealousy of Antoine, and Fernand decides it is time to close the shop.Helped by the Volfoni brothers and Folace, Fernand kicks all the guests out of the house. The men are so excited by their job that they even kick Paul Volfoni out, which makes them laugh a lot. But they stop laughing when they see Patricia crying on the staircase.Next morning, Folace wakes up Fernand to tell him that Patricia has gone away during the night with her suitcase. Fortunately, Jean wrote down the license plate of the taxicab who took her away.The cab driver brings Fernand to Antoine's apartment. When Fernand walks in the living-room, Antoine is experimenting «musique concrète» (concrete music). He doesn't seem to appreciate Fernand interrupting him. But Patricia calms Fernand down when she walks in from the kitchen. She tells her «uncle» she is going to marry Antoine. Fernand likes the idea better when she tells him that Antoine's father is vice-president of the International Monetary Fund.Two or three days later, it is Fernand's birthday. Early in the morning, Patricia, Jean and Folace give him a present each. Patricia adds a present brought in very early from the Volfoni brothers. When Fernand hears a threatening tick-tock coming from the parcel, he throws it through the open window, and the parcel explodes in the garden. We can see Théo and Vincent walking discreetly away.Fernand goes to the Volfoni's barge, and, when Raoul opens the door, Fernand sings «Happy Birthday» and then punches Raoul violently on the nose. After his departure, Raoul fixes a small bomb to get his own back on Fernand.During the night, Fernand hears a strange noise and puts a gun in his night-robe pocket.Meanwhile in the garage, Raoul is putting his bomb inside Fernand's car.

But Pascal and Bastien tells Fernand it was wrong of him to think it was the Volfoni's fault. They explain that, if the Volfoni had decided to kill Fernand or Henri, the first person they would have asked to do it would have been Bastien, their official gunman. Pascal thinks the whole business comes from Théo. Fernand asks Pascal and Bastien to go and have a friendly chat with Théo.In the distlllery, Pascal and Bastien do not find Théo, but only Tomate.

    Synopsis
    A Public Works Plant in Montauban, in the South-East of France. Late in the evening, the boss, Fernand Naudin (Lino Ventura), takes his car to go to Paris on some urgent matter. Which bothers his assistant because of the annual Fair on the next week-end.Early in the morning, Fernand arrives in Paris on the Champs-Elysées, to meet his old friend, Louis (Jacques Dumesnil), who just came back from Mexico, where he had gone fifteen years before, to get away from French justice. They remained very close friends, even after Fernand change to legal business. The meeting place is a bowling alley, where Fernand is met by another friend of Louis, Henri (Paul Mercey), the manager of the place.In an apartment above the bowling alley, Louis is lying in bed, where a doctor is giving him a shot. After the doctor is gone, Louis explains Fernand that he is very ill, and that he came back to France do die and be buried next to his parents. He also tells Fernand about his 18-year old daughter, Patricia, whose mother was a hooker friend of him, and whom he would like Fernand to take care of after his death. Money is no problem, since Louis has several not quite legal business, but which work very smoothly, and which get enough money for Patricia's needs. Nevertheless Fernand is not very happy about the idea.Their heated conversation is stopped by the arrival of Louis' assistants, Raoul (Bertrand Blier) and Paul (Jean Lefebvre) Volfoni, who run a clandestine and illegal roulette on a barge, and Théo (Horst Frank), who runs an illegal distillery. Théo, who is homosexual, has come with his boyfriend, Vincent (Georges Nojaroff), whom Louis doesn't want to be present. Louis tells the three remaining men that Fernand is now in charge of his business, which doesn't seem to please Raoul Volfoni. But Pascal (Valentino Venantini), Louis' gunman, being around, neither the Volfoni brothers nor Théo don't say much about it.After they're gone, Fernand remains alone with Louis. When Louis has an attack, Fernand calls Pascal to help him and Louis dies in both men's arms.After Louis' death, Fernand goes back in the bowling alley, where Henri gets him something to eat. The Volfoni brothers try to talk Fernand out of taking over Louis' business, but Fernand refuses not to keep a promise made to a dying friend. Their conversation is interrupted by a phone call from Tomate, who runs a illegal roulette in a farm. Tomate seems to have some problem with nervous patrons. Pascal wants to have a look and Fernand asks him to go with him. After their departure, Théo, who, unlike the Volfoni, didn't say a word to Fernand, tells Vincent, his boyfriend, that he has just taken care of Fernand as a problem.Pascal and Fernand reach the farm, but they've just left their car when they get machine-gunned from a gunman in a big American car. Pascal kills both the gunman and the driver, and then goes inside the farm, followed by a slightly disturbed Fernand, who wonders if the Volfoni are not the sponsors of the dead gunman. Pascal agrees with him.Tomate (Charles Régnier), alone in the roulette room, seems very surprised by what Pascal and Fernand tell him. He sends his henchman, Freddy (Henri Cogan), to clean the mess made by the gun fight, and then he explains to Fernand that he had no problem that evening in the roulette room, and consequently that he never phoned the bowling alley. But when Fernand phones the bowling alley, he learns that Henri has been shot and killed, and that the police is already there.Pascal drives Fernand to the 18th century manor that Louis had bought for his daughter, who lives there with her two «uncles», Folace (Francis Blanche), who is a shady attorney in charge of Louis' business, and Jean (Robert Dalban), who is a former burglar, adopted by Louis, and converted into a butler.

When Fernand tells her they must have a serious conversation, she gets away.A bit later, Folace tells Fernand that Louis' business is not running as smoothly as he thought, and even less since Louis' «assistants» learned about his death.Fernand then meets Patricia's fiancé, Antoine Delafoy (Claude Rich), a musical genius or so he pretends himself to be !

                    Sentemental military comedy revolves around two contemporary army buddies, Master Sergeant Maxwell Slaughter (Jackie Gleason), a smooth operator, who supply Sergeant Eustis Clay (Steve McQueen) idolizes and hopes will join him as a civilian in a private business enterprise. Clay endeavors to be a player in the military, just like Slaughter, but it seems as though Clay still has a lot to learn from his mentor. They are joined by Tuesday Weld as a shrill dizzy blonde teenager named Bobby Jo Pepperdine and Tony Bill as bumbling Private First Class Jerry Meltzer, McQueen's screwball sidekick.

                    In 1944, Capt. Josiah J. Newman is the doctor in charge of Ward 7, the neuropsychiatric ward, at an Army Air Corps hospital in Arizona. The hospital is under-resourced and Newman scrounges what he needs with the help of his inventive staff, especially Cpl. Jake Leibowitz. The military in general is only just coming to accept psychiatric disorders as legitimate and Newman generally has 6 weeks to cure them or send them on to another facility. There are many patients in the ward and his latest include Colonel Norville Bliss who has dissociated from his past; Capt. Paul Winston who is nearly catatonic after spending 13 months hiding in a cellar behind enemy lines; and 20 year-old Cpl. Jim Tompkins who is severely traumatized after his aircraft was shot down. Others come and go, including Italian prisoners of war, but Newman and team all realize that their success means the men will return to their units and combat.

                    It's 1944 during WWII. During Captain Joe Newman, M.D.'s reign as head of the psychiatric ward at Colfax Air Force Base in Arizona, the number of patients in the ward has grown exponentially. According to Newman, the diagnoses are now only more accurate, not the number of air force personnel who have actually required psychiatric assistance. This assessment is against that of the base commander, Colonel Edgar Peyser, who believes many of the patients are fit for active war duty. Newman feels his ward is short staffed and he does whatever he needs to to get additional staff. So when Corporal Jake Leibowitz comes to the hospital to be assigned to work as an orderly in another ward, Newman manages to abscond the reluctant Leibowitz to work in the psych ward. One not high on ceremony, the excitable and energetic Leibowitz adds a little needed levity into the day to day operations of the ward, although many of his actions are less than military regulation. Newman also coerces the beautiful nurse, Lieutenant Francie Corum, to transfer into the ward, Newman believing her beauty will soothe the patients' psyches. Three of the more interesting cases in the ward are that of: Colonel Norville Bliss, who knows he needs help but isn't sure what is causing his mental breaks; Captain Paul Winston, whose primary symptom is a constant need to sleep, his mental issues which his VIP family would rather not deal with directly; and Corporal Jim Tompkins, whose excessive alcohol consumption, insomnia and bravado overshadow his real emotional issues.

                    Dr. Josiah Newman runs the psychiatric unit of a U.S. Military Hospital during WWII. Short of help, Newman coerces newly arrived neurotic orderly Jackson Leibowitz to work in his ward. Leibowitz's scheming & humor quickly turns life inside the ward upside down. Newman, while amused, tries to maintain a semblance of order. Newman's other recruit to the ward is nurse Lt. Francie Corum. Corum is at first shocked by what she sees in the ward, but admires the compassionate & effective way in which Newman deals with each of his patients. Together Newman & Corum help a variety of patients with war related psychological traumas, while they themselves struggle with the dilemma of healing these soldiers so they can be sent back into battle to face possible death.

                    Frank Michaelson, well respected President of the Pacific Pallisades Board of Education, is appearing in front of a Board hearing addressing the issue of the widespread public outcry asking for either his dismissal or resignation because of a series of salacious front page newspaper stories, complete with photographs, on his recent goings-on. In addressing these unsubstantiated charges, Frank attributes all the incidents on his eldest daughter, Mollie Michaelson, now just shy of her twentieth birthday, no longer being the sweet child he had always pictured her as, but now rather a desirable young woman. Frank and his wife Anne first noticed Mollie blossoming into such when she went away to college, first to Hawthorne, a girls' college in New England, and then to a prestigious art school in Paris. In Frank noticing Mollie becoming a desirable woman and her leaving home happening at the same time, Frank admits that he had troubles letting go of Mollie and thus he did whatever he felt he needed to to protect her, even if she didn't really want or need that help. His problems were compounded by his encounters with a slightly off kilter Englishman he met in Paris, and many, including some paparazzi, believing that he is American actor James Stewart.

                    Jimmy Stewart plays a cautious father to Sandra Dee, who is going off to college. He gets so worried that she is doing things that she's not supposed to be doing, that he tracks her down at her school, and then tracks her down in Europe. What's even worse is that he has to explain his actions to the members of a school board regents in order to keep his job on that board.
