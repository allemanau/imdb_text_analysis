He describes that many amateurs have tried to get involved in this career, but he implies that they always end up dead. Meanwhile, the city is quartered into sectors policed by occupying forces -- the English, the Russians, the Americans and the French -- though they barely can handle the criminal element and don't even speak the same language. The city is devastated (""bombed about a bit,"" says the narrator), covered in jagged rubble. He begins to tell the story of an American coming to Vienna named Holly Martins, who has come to accept a job from an old friend.Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) gets off his train and is surprised that his friend, Harry Lime, isn't at the station to meet him. Holly goes to Lime's flat, but the building porter (Paul Hörbiger), through extremely broken English, tells him that he just missed Lime's friends leaving with a coffin. The porter says that Harry was killed, hit by a truck right in front of the building.Martins goes to a massive graveyard and finds a funeral service. An Englishman (Trevor Howard) hovering nearby informs Holly it is Harry's funeral. Standing by the grave are two middle-aged men, both of whom eye Holly suspiciously. Also in attendance is a pretty woman (Alida Valli) who doesn't notice him. After the funeral, Martins begins to walk back into town, and the Englishman offers him a ride.The stranger introduces himself as Major Calloway, a police officer in the British sector of Vienna, and offers to buy him a drink. Holly agrees and proceeds to drink while reminiscing about Harry. It is revealed that Holly is an author of pulp Western novellas. As he talks about his old friend, Calloway says that it's better that Lime is dead, since he was a murderer and a racketeer. Holly takes umbrage at Calloway's suggestion and reaches to punch him, but he's quickly socked in the face by fellow English soldier Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee). Paine apologizes and escorts the tipsy Martins to the nearby hotel, explaining to Holly earnestly that he is a huge fan of his books. Calloway sets Martins up at the hotel for the night, telling him he can catch a plane out of Vienna the next day. Holly promises he will prove him wrong about Lime.Happening by on the way out of the hotel is another Englishman named Crabbin (Wilfrid Hyde-White). Paine tells Crabbin that Holly is an author, and though Crabbin has never heard of him, he is excited to have a writer in Vienna. Crabbin introduces himself to Holly and explains he represents the British cultural propaganda department in Vienna. He invites Holly to stay and give lecture in a few days at the department's meeting. Figuring he could use the extra time in town as an opportunity to look into Harry's death, Holly accepts the offer.Holly is then called on the hotel phone by a man who identifies himself as Baron Kurtz. The man says he is a friend of Harry's. Martins and Kurtz set up a meeting at a nearby cafe. When they meet, Holly recognizes Kurtz (Ernst Deutsch) as one of the two men at Harry's funeral. Kurtz is carrying one of Holly's books, which he says Harry had given to him, and a small dog.Holly proceeds to grill Kurtz about the circumstances of Harry's death. Kurtz and Martins go out to the street in front of Harry's apartment building to reconstruct the events of the accident. Kurtz's version is this: he was walking out of Harry's flat with him when Harry saw a Romanian friend of his, Popescu, across the street. Harry then began to cross the street to greet Popescu when a truck drove up and ran Harry over. Then Kurtz and Popescu carried Harry to the sidewalk. Shortly thereafter, Harry's doctor, Dr. Winkel, happened by. The doctor was too late to save Harry, however. Holly asks Kurtz to help him investigate further, but Kurtz says as he is an Austrian, he must be careful with the police. Martins tells him the police think Harry was a racketeer. Kurtz points out most everyone in Vienna is mixed up in some sort of racket, but mostly nothing serious--tires, stamps, etc.Kurtz describes how after Harry was hit, he instructed him to see after Holly when he arrived. Holly points out the porter, who is near them outside the apartment sweeping, told him that Harry died instantaneously. Kurtz looks the porter over and says that Harry died before the ambulance arrived, but that he was still alive immediately after he was run over. Holly tells Kurtz he wants to speak to Popescu, but he says Popescu has left Vienna. At Holly's insistence, Kurtz tells him the identity of the pretty woman at the funeral. He does not remember her name, but he tells Holly she was a companion of Harry's who works as an actress at a local theater. Kurtz tells Holly he lives in the Russian sector but works at the Casanova Club, and if he has any need for advice to contact him there. Holly then tries to question the porter again. However, the porter's wife, overhearing the conversation, looks frightened and calls for her husband to come inside.That evening, Holly goes to theater where the woman, named Anna Schmidt, is performing. He introduces himself as a friend of Harry Lime's, and she tells him to come back after the show. When he meets her afterwards, Martins finds out that Anna, so depressed over Harry's death that she declares she wishes she too were dead, had been dating Harry for some time and that Harry had allegedly asked Kurtz that Anna be taken care of as well just before he died. Martins thinks it funny that Harry had time to think of both him and Anna right after the accident, even though he supposedly died instantly, or at least very quickly. Anna also reveals that the man driving the truck was Harry's own driver. Holly tells Anna that he has a feeling that there's something suspicous about Harry's death -- that seemingly everyone he knew was at the scene -- and he convinces her to help him speak to the porter again.Anna and Holly go to talk with the porter in Harry's apartment. Anna pokes around the flat, seemingly reminiscing, and half-heartedly translates the German for Martins. The porter tells them that Harry's neck was broken in such a way that he had to have died immediately; therefore, there was no way he could have asked Kurtz that Anna and Martins be taken care of. He also says that three men carried Harry to the sidewalk, not two (Kurtz & Popescu), as Kurtz had claimed. Holly asks the porter why he did not reveal this information at the inquest, and the porter responds he didn't want to be mixed up in the situation and that he wasn't the only witness who did not give a complete testimony. As Holly tries to convince the porter take his story to the police, the conversation becomes heated. The porter, who becomes fearful, insists in German that Holly leave and never come back. An elfin boy spies them arguing just before Holly and Anna leave.Holly walks Anna back to her place and they are met by Anna's landlady (Hedwig Bleibtreu), who frantically tells her that the police are inspecting her apartment. Holly and Anna go upstairs to find Major Calloway and Sergeant Paine supervising as her apartment is torn apart. Calloway asks for her passport, which he and Paine inspect and then suspect is fake. The Major tells her he must keep it. Holly tells Calloway that he suspects Harry may have been murdered, but he says he doesn't care how Harry died as long he's dead. He suggests Holly should go back to the airport and go home. As they continue to go through her things, including love letters to her from Harry, Anna explains quietly to Holly about her passport, which she reveals Harry forged for her. She explains that she is Czechoslovakian and that the Russians would claim her and have her deported if it was found out that she was not Austrian. Calloway takes Anna back with the other officers to the police station, and on her way out, Holly asks her to remind him of Harry's doctor's name so he can go talk with him.Holly goes to ask Dr. Winkel (Erich Ponto) about Harry's death. The doctor was the man standing by Kurtz at the funeral. In his home, Holly sees the same small dog that Kurtz was carrying earlier. The doctor tersely adheres to Kurtz's take on the events, and he confirms that he arrived after Harry was already dead. Holly asks if it's possible that Harry was pushed in front of the truck, if he knows if Harry could have died instantaneously or not, and if there was a third man who helped carry Harry's body to the sidewalk. Dr. Winkel tells Holly he can give no additional opinion as to the circumstances of the accident, since he did not witness the event and the injuries would have been the same no matter how it happened. He also says there was no third man on the scene by the time he arrived.At the international police station, Anna sees a Russian officer flipping through her papers as she waits. Calloway comes in and questions her about Harry. He shows her a picture of man named Joseph Harbin and asks if she knows who he is. Anna says she's never seen him before. He explains that Harbin is a worker in a military hospital, but she insists she does not know him. He accuses her of lying, which he says is stupid because he could help her with her passport. He explains that in one of her confiscated letters, Harry had written her to instruct her to place a call to the Casanova Club for someone named Joseph. Anna barely remembers that the message for Joseph was something about meeting Harry at his home. Calloway tells her that the day she telephoned that message to Joseph Harbin, he disappeared. Anna insists Calloway has Harry all wrong, and he sends her away, though he keeps her passport and belongings.Anna then goes with Holly, who was waiting outside the station for her, to the Casanova Club. Crabbin is inside just leaving, and he reminds Holly of the lecture he is to give the next night. Holly and Anna sit at the bar and see Kurtz playing violin for a dining couple. Kurtz looks dismayed to see Holly again and, when questioned, insists that only he and Popescu carried Harry and that the porter must have been mistaken. Kurtz says that Popescu happens to be at the club that night, despite his earlier claim that Popescu was out of town. Holly meets Popescu (Siegfried Breuer), whose account of Harry's death mirrors Kurtz's account in all aspects. Holly again asks if a third man helped him and Kurtz carry Harry's body, but Popescu denies this, asking where Holly heard such a thing. He tells him the porter at Harry's building had heard the accident and witnessed the aftermath. This is evidently news to Popescu, who was unaware that the porter was a witness since he had not given testimony at the inquest.Popescu is then seen arranging and attending a mysterious meeting on a bridge with Kurtz, Dr. Winkel, and an unseen fourth man.The following morning, while Holly wanders thoughtfully in front of Harry's former home, the porter leans out the window and apologizes to Holly for his previous demeanor, arranging to meet with him later to tell him something important. When the porter closes the window and turns around, he reacts with surprise and terror to an unseen person who has presumably snuck up behind him.Holly goes to visit Anna to tell her the porter wants to talk to him again. She is especially depressed about Harry, and she begs Holly to tell her stories about him. They talk about Harry, painting him as a mischievous boy who never grew up. She insists they go see the porter together, accidentally calling him Harry, which lightly miffs Holly.As they walk up to the front of the porter's building, they see a crowd gathered near the door. Anna immediately wants to leave, assuming it to be trouble. Holly, however, walks over to the crowd, where he is told the porter has been murdered. The little boy who had seen Holly and the porter arguing begins insisting something about Holly loudly in German. Slowly, the assembled crowd turns to stare at Holly. Anna explains that the crowd thinks he is the murderer. He grabs Anna and they run away. The crowd pursues them, with the little boy in the lead. Holly and Anna duck into a movie theater, losing the mob. Holly tells Anna to go back home where she'll be safe.Holly eventually makes his way back to his hotel, where he asks the desk clerk for a taxi driver. The clerk indicates that an imposing-looking man standing there is a driver already waiting for him. With Holly in the back seat, the driver speeds off recklessly without Holly saying where he wants to go. Holly, very frightened, asks him if he is taking him to be killed. The driver does not answer and finally stops in front of a doorway. Holly, sure that he's about to be murdered, starts to run, but the door opens. Crabbin greets him, and Holly realizes it is time for the speaking engagement that he'd agreed to.Holly struggles with the intellectual questions posed to him. The audience begins to dissipate, while Crabbin agonizes over the misstep of hiring Holly. Unexpectedly, Popescu arrives, and he asks Holly if he's working on a book. Holly says that he's writing a book called ""The Third Man"" and that it's based on fact. Popescu suggests that Holly stick to fiction, but Holly insists he will finish this ""book."" As the meeting is closed, two thuggish-looking men arrive and get whispered orders from Popescu. Holly takes off up the spiral staircase at the back of the building and the two thugs pursue him. Holly ducks into in unlocked room, where he is bitten by an unexpected parrot. He makes his way out of a window and finds refuge from the thugs in a car hidden among the wartime rubble.Once safe, Holly goes to the international police station to tell Calloway about his findings. Calloway, though now convinced that Harry Lime was murdered, is still indifferent and explains that it's better that Harry is dead. Holly insists he is wrong, so the Major offers to show Holly why he believes Harry is guilty of racketeering and murder. Calloway then presents a myriad of evidence, proving that Harry obtained penicillin illegally, diluted it, and sold it to war-ravaged, poor hospitals, resulting in the painful deaths of many people. (Watered-down penicillin is not only ineffective, but it also makes the patient immune to future doses of penicillin, thus rendering medical treatment incredibly difficult or impossible.) Many of his victims were children with meningitis; the lucky ones, the Major says, died, and the unlucky ones lived and went insane. He shows Holly a slide of the hospital worker Joseph Harbin, who he explains helped steal the penicillin for Harry. The police forced Harbin to give them information about Harry's operation, but he has recently gone missing. Holly, now convinced of Harry's guilt, is devastated by the news about his old friend and agrees to go back to America.After Holly goes out to a bar and gets drunk, he buys flowers and takes them to Anna in her apartment. He drunkenly calls to Anna's cat, who is indifferent to him, and Anna explains the only person the cat ever liked was Harry. The cat slips out the window. Anna lets Holly know that Calloway also told her about Harry's misdeeds, and though she now believes in his guilt as well, it doesn't change her feelings for Harry.We then see a man outside Anna's window on the street. He ducks into a dark doorway. Anna's cat, who has run out of the apartment, curls up at his feet.In the apartment, Anna says Harry is better off dead, but not because he was punished for doing wrong, as Calloway believes. Holly agrees he's better off dead, and he no longer cares who killed him or why. He believes there was justice in Harry's death, and he says maybe he would have even killed Harry himself. He also tells Anna that he's fallen in love with her, but she makes it apparent that the feeling isn't mutual, as she thinks only of Harry.Disappointed and still drunk, Holly stumbles outside to return to his hotel, but he sees the obscured man standing in the dark doorway, the cat still at his feet. Holly shouts at him to stop spying and to show himself, but he does not move. Holly's noise causes a woman upstairs to turn on her light and open her window to yell at him to be quiet. The light from the woman's apartment shines down into the street, revealing the man in the doorway to be Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Harry smiles at a shocked Holly, but slips away when the woman turns off her light. Seeing Harry's shadow running off down a nearby street, Holly takes pursuit. He follows the sound of footsteps down a passageway that opens into a plaza, but once Holly reaches the end of the passageway, Harry is already gone.Holly brings Calloway and Paine out the area to re-enact the events, but they are unconvinced. However, suddenly a light bulb goes off for Calloway as he eyes a booth in the plaza. Opening the door on the booth, Calloway shows Holly that it is an entranceway to the Vienna sewers, with steps leading downwards. They follow the stairs into the sewers, where they see an endless range of tunnels for Harry to use as escape routes.That night, Calloway leads a team to excavate Harry's grave. When they open the coffin, the body inside is revealed to be that of Joseph Harbin.The international police come to Anna's apartment for her as she lies in bed crying in Harry's old pajamas. Anna surely assumes this is because of her forged papers. As she is led into the station, Holly sees her and yells at her that he's seen Harry alive. Calloway is standing in the hallway as the police lead her through the station, and he instructs them to bring her into his office. He interrogates her alone, asking when she saw Lime last. He explains in his coffin was Joseph Harbin's body. She looks thrilled as she realizes this does mean that Harry is alive, and she asks where he is. Calloway thinks she might know, but it is clear she was not aware he has been alive either. He says they know Harry is hiding in the Russian sector (which is where Kurtz lives, as he told Holly), and that if she helps them catch Lime, Calloway will help her with the Russians, who are about to interrogate her about her passport. She cannot help him, though, and he tells her they will catch him eventually, as Vienna is a closed city. She says that she wishes that he was dead, as he would be safe from ""all of you.""The next morning, Holly goes to visit Baron Kurtz's apartment in the Russian sector. Kurtz looks over his balcony and invites Holly up, but Holly refuses, as he shouts back that he wants to speak only with Harry. Dr. Winkel comes out on the balcony also, and he and Kurtz exchange concerned looks. Though they admit nothing about Harry, Holly insists that he come meet him at the nearby fairgrounds.As Holly waits next to the Ferris wheel, he spots Harry walking up to warmly greet him, acting as if nothing has changed. They go for a ride on the Ferris wheel. Harry shows no remorse for his penicillin racket, asking Holly about the people far below them if Holly would really care if one of ""those little dots"" stopped moving forever, especially if he were paid for each dot. When Holly reveals that he told the police about seeing Harry, Harry is very unhappy that Holly has been talking to the cops. Harry, staring at Holly, clearly considers shooting him and throwing him out of the Ferris wheel to his death. Holly takes him seriously enough to wrap his arm tightly around the car door should Harry try anything. However, when Holly also says that they've dug up his grave and found Harbin, Harry changes his mind and jokes that neither one of them would ever think of doing something to the other. Harry also reveals that he was the one who informed the Russian police about Anna's forged passport as payment for them letting him hide out in the Russian sector. As they finish the ride, Harry offers to cut Holly in on his schemes, but without waiting for an answer, Harry leaves quickly, telling him that they can meet again any time he wants, but no police.Holly goes to meet with Calloway and tells him he knows where Harry is staying. The Major tries to convince him to help them trap Harry by arranging to meet him at a cafe in the international zone. However, though Holly knows his friend has done wrong, he is unwilling to be the one to doom him. Just then, the Russian officer comes in with Anna's passport, explaining to Calloway that she must be deported. The Major mentions to him that the Russians were supposed to be helping the British police with Harry Lime, but the Russian says the two cases are not related and that they will get to his case eventually. He leaves the room, Anna's passport sitting on Calloway's desk. Calloway, seemingly resigned to Holly giving up in Harry's case, talks about how helpful Holly could have been in getting Lime, but Holly is staring at Anna's papers sitting on the desk. Holly asks what price would Calloway pay for his help, and he tells him to name it.Paine accompanies Anna to board the train that will save her from the Russian authorities. Just as she settles into her car, she spies Holly trying to see her off inconspicuously. Understanding that her leaving must have been part of a deal Holly struck with Calloway, she gets off the train and confronts Holly about why he's there. He admits he has agreed to ""betray"" Harry in turn for her getting away. Anna makes it evident that she's disgusted with Holly and could never do anything to hurt Harry. She leaves angrily, ripping up her passport, and allows the train to depart with her belongings.Now despondent, Holly asks that Calloway and Paine just take him to the airport, having changed his mind to help them catch Harry. He shows them Anna's torn up papers. Calloway agrees, but on the way to the airport, the Major makes an extra stop. It is the children's ward of a hospital, where Calloway shows Holly the devastating effects of Harry's dilluted penicillin. Horrified by the sight of painfully dying children, Holly reluctantly agrees again to entrap Harry.At a cafe Holly waits to meet Harry while Calloway, Paine, and several other policemen stake out nearby in the shadows. Anna comes into the cafe to admonish Holly, his location disclosed to her by Baron Kurtz as he was being arrested. While she talks to him, Harry has snuck in the back of the cafe. Just as Harry enters behind Anna, she yells at Holly for being a police informant. Harry reacts, drawing a gun to shoot Holly. Anna is standing in the way and tells Harry that he must escape or the police will get him. Harry tells Anna to move so he can kill Holly, but he spots Sergeant Paine entering the front of the cafe and turns to run.Harry rushes to the nearest sewer entrance and goes down into the tunnels. Paine, Calloway, Holly, and international policemen pursue Harry through the maze of sewer passages. Harry, for a time, evades the many men, but he is eventually cornered. Holly happens upon the panicked Harry and, hiding from the range of Harry's gun, tells him that he must give up. Sergeant Paine, followed by Calloway, comes rushing to Holly to warn him to get back, but Harry shoots Paine, and he falls. Harry tries to run but is shot by Calloway.Harry manages to crawl out of sight while Calloway leans over the dying Paine. Holly takes Paine's gun and sets off after Harry, and Calloway tells him to shoot on sight. In a passageway, badly wounded, Harry strains to climb up steps to escape through a sewer grate. He manages to make it to the top of the staircase, where he reaches his fingers up through the grate, feeling the air above. However, he is too weak to lift the manhole cover, and he drops his head into his arms. Holly walks up and aims the gun at Harry. Harry weakly lifts his head and nods slightly at Holly, a silent okay for Holly to mercy-kill him. A shot rings out in the sewers. Calloway sees the figure of Holly emerging from the passageway alone.Soon after, Harry again has another funeral in the same cemetery. Holly, Calloway, and Anna are the only attendees. After the service, Calloway begins to drive Holly to the airport. Seeing Anna walking behind them down the same tree-lined trail as the first time he saw her, Holly asks to get out to speak to her. Holly waits for Anna as she walks down the long road toward him. When she nears him, though, she does not acknowledge his presence and walks by. Holly doesn't say anything, but he puts his head down and lights a cigarette.","

    Synopsis
    Sights of Vienna, Austria, flash across the screen as an Englishman's voice (Carol Reed) describes the racketeer trade in the post-World War II era. He describes that many amateurs have tried to get involved in this career, but he implies that they always end up dead. Meanwhile, the city is quartered into sectors policed by occupying forces -- the English, the Russians, the Americans and the French -- though they barely can handle the criminal element and don't even speak the same language. The city is devastated (""bombed about a bit,"" says the narrator), covered in jagged rubble. He begins to tell the story of an American coming to Vienna named Holly Martins, who has come to accept a job from an old friend.Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) gets off his train and is surprised that his friend, Harry Lime, isn't at the station to meet him. Holly goes to Lime's flat, but the building porter (Paul Hörbiger), through extremely broken English, tells him that he just missed Lime's friends leaving with a coffin. The porter says that Harry was killed, hit by a truck right in front of the building.Martins goes to a massive graveyard and finds a funeral service. An Englishman (Trevor Howard) hovering nearby informs Holly it is Harry's funeral. Standing by the grave are two middle-aged men, both of whom eye Holly suspiciously. Also in attendance is a pretty woman (Alida Valli) who doesn't notice him. After the funeral, Martins begins to walk back into town, and the Englishman offers him a ride.The stranger introduces himself as Major Calloway, a police officer in the British sector of Vienna, and offers to buy him a drink. Holly agrees and proceeds to drink while reminiscing about Harry. It is revealed that Holly is an author of pulp Western novellas. As he talks about his old friend, Calloway says that it's better that Lime is dead, since he was a murderer and a racketeer. Holly takes umbrage at Calloway's suggestion and reaches to punch him, but he's quickly socked in the face by fellow English soldier Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee). Paine apologizes and escorts the tipsy Martins to the nearby hotel, explaining to Holly earnestly that he is a huge fan of his books. Calloway sets Martins up at the hotel for the night, telling him he can catch a plane out of Vienna the next day. Holly promises he will prove him wrong about Lime.Happening by on the way out of the hotel is another Englishman named Crabbin (Wilfrid Hyde-White). Paine tells Crabbin that Holly is an author, and though Crabbin has never heard of him, he is excited to have a writer in Vienna. Crabbin introduces himself to Holly and explains he represents the British cultural propaganda department in Vienna. He invites Holly to stay and give lecture in a few days at the department's meeting. Figuring he could use the extra time in town as an opportunity to look into Harry's death, Holly accepts the offer.Holly is then called on the hotel phone by a man who identifies himself as Baron Kurtz. The man says he is a friend of Harry's. Martins and Kurtz set up a meeting at a nearby cafe. When they meet, Holly recognizes Kurtz (Ernst Deutsch) as one of the two men at Harry's funeral. Kurtz is carrying one of Holly's books, which he says Harry had given to him, and a small dog.Holly proceeds to grill Kurtz about the circumstances of Harry's death. Kurtz and Martins go out to the street in front of Harry's apartment building to reconstruct the events of the accident. Kurtz's version is this: he was walking out of Harry's flat with him when Harry saw a Romanian friend of his, Popescu, across the street. Harry then began to cross the street to greet Popescu when a truck drove up and ran Harry over. Then Kurtz and Popescu carried Harry to the sidewalk. Shortly thereafter, Harry's doctor, Dr. Winkel, happened by. The doctor was too late to save Harry, however. Holly asks Kurtz to help him investigate further, but Kurtz says as he is an Austrian, he must be careful with the police. Martins tells him the police think Harry was a racketeer. Kurtz points out most everyone in Vienna is mixed up in some sort of racket, but mostly nothing serious--tires, stamps, etc.Kurtz describes how after Harry was hit, he instructed him to see after Holly when he arrived. Holly points out the porter, who is near them outside the apartment sweeping, told him that Harry died instantaneously. Kurtz looks the porter over and says that Harry died before the ambulance arrived, but that he was still alive immediately after he was run over. Holly tells Kurtz he wants to speak to Popescu, but he says Popescu has left Vienna. At Holly's insistence, Kurtz tells him the identity of the pretty woman at the funeral. He does not remember her name, but he tells Holly she was a companion of Harry's who works as an actress at a local theater. Kurtz tells Holly he lives in the Russian sector but works at the Casanova Club, and if he has any need for advice to contact him there. Holly then tries to question the porter again. However, the porter's wife, overhearing the conversation, looks frightened and calls for her husband to come inside.That evening, Holly goes to theater where the woman, named Anna Schmidt, is performing. He introduces himself as a friend of Harry Lime's, and she tells him to come back after the show. When he meets her afterwards, Martins finds out that Anna, so depressed over Harry's death that she declares she wishes she too were dead, had been dating Harry for some time and that Harry had allegedly asked Kurtz that Anna be taken care of as well just before he died. Martins thinks it funny that Harry had time to think of both him and Anna right after the accident, even though he supposedly died instantly, or at least very quickly. Anna also reveals that the man driving the truck was Harry's own driver. Holly tells Anna that he has a feeling that there's something suspicous about Harry's death -- that seemingly everyone he knew was at the scene -- and he convinces her to help him speak to the porter again.Anna and Holly go to talk with the porter in Harry's apartment. Anna pokes around the flat, seemingly reminiscing, and half-heartedly translates the German for Martins. The porter tells them that Harry's neck was broken in such a way that he had to have died immediately; therefore, there was no way he could have asked Kurtz that Anna and Martins be taken care of. He also says that three men carried Harry to the sidewalk, not two (Kurtz & Popescu), as Kurtz had claimed. Holly asks the porter why he did not reveal this information at the inquest, and the porter responds he didn't want to be mixed up in the situation and that he wasn't the only witness who did not give a complete testimony. As Holly tries to convince the porter take his story to the police, the conversation becomes heated. The porter, who becomes fearful, insists in German that Holly leave and never come back. An elfin boy spies them arguing just before Holly and Anna leave.Holly walks Anna back to her place and they are met by Anna's landlady (Hedwig Bleibtreu), who frantically tells her that the police are inspecting her apartment. Holly and Anna go upstairs to find Major Calloway and Sergeant Paine supervising as her apartment is torn apart. Calloway asks for her passport, which he and Paine inspect and then suspect is fake. The Major tells her he must keep it. Holly tells Calloway that he suspects Harry may have been murdered, but he says he doesn't care how Harry died as long he's dead. He suggests Holly should go back to the airport and go home. As they continue to go through her things, including love letters to her from Harry, Anna explains quietly to Holly about her passport, which she reveals Harry forged for her. She explains that she is Czechoslovakian and that the Russians would claim her and have her deported if it was found out that she was not Austrian. Calloway takes Anna back with the other officers to the police station, and on her way out, Holly asks her to remind him of Harry's doctor's name so he can go talk with him.Holly goes to ask Dr. Winkel (Erich Ponto) about Harry's death. The doctor was the man standing by Kurtz at the funeral. In his home, Holly sees the same small dog that Kurtz was carrying earlier. The doctor tersely adheres to Kurtz's take on the events, and he confirms that he arrived after Harry was already dead. Holly asks if it's possible that Harry was pushed in front of the truck, if he knows if Harry could have died instantaneously or not, and if there was a third man who helped carry Harry's body to the sidewalk. Dr. Winkel tells Holly he can give no additional opinion as to the circumstances of the accident, since he did not witness the event and the injuries would have been the same no matter how it happened. He also says there was no third man on the scene by the time he arrived.At the international police station, Anna sees a Russian officer flipping through her papers as she waits. Calloway comes in and questions her about Harry. He shows her a picture of man named Joseph Harbin and asks if she knows who he is. Anna says she's never seen him before. He explains that Harbin is a worker in a military hospital, but she insists she does not know him. He accuses her of lying, which he says is stupid because he could help her with her passport. He explains that in one of her confiscated letters, Harry had written her to instruct her to place a call to the Casanova Club for someone named Joseph. Anna barely remembers that the message for Joseph was something about meeting Harry at his home. Calloway tells her that the day she telephoned that message to Joseph Harbin, he disappeared. Anna insists Calloway has Harry all wrong, and he sends her away, though he keeps her passport and belongings.Anna then goes with Holly, who was waiting outside the station for her, to the Casanova Club. Crabbin is inside just leaving, and he reminds Holly of the lecture he is to give the next night. Holly and Anna sit at the bar and see Kurtz playing violin for a dining couple. Kurtz looks dismayed to see Holly again and, when questioned, insists that only he and Popescu carried Harry and that the porter must have been mistaken. Kurtz says that Popescu happens to be at the club that night, despite his earlier claim that Popescu was out of town. Holly meets Popescu (Siegfried Breuer), whose account of Harry's death mirrors Kurtz's account in all aspects. Holly again asks if a third man helped him and Kurtz carry Harry's body, but Popescu denies this, asking where Holly heard such a thing. He tells him the porter at Harry's building had heard the accident and witnessed the aftermath. This is evidently news to Popescu, who was unaware that the porter was a witness since he had not given testimony at the inquest.Popescu is then seen arranging and attending a mysterious meeting on a bridge with Kurtz, Dr. Winkel, and an unseen fourth man.The following morning, while Holly wanders thoughtfully in front of Harry's former home, the porter leans out the window and apologizes to Holly for his previous demeanor, arranging to meet with him later to tell him something important. When the porter closes the window and turns around, he reacts with surprise and terror to an unseen person who has presumably snuck up behind him.Holly goes to visit Anna to tell her the porter wants to talk to him again. She is especially depressed about Harry, and she begs Holly to tell her stories about him. They talk about Harry, painting him as a mischievous boy who never grew up. She insists they go see the porter together, accidentally calling him Harry, which lightly miffs Holly.As they walk up to the front of the porter's building, they see a crowd gathered near the door. Anna immediately wants to leave, assuming it to be trouble. Holly, however, walks over to the crowd, where he is told the porter has been murdered. The little boy who had seen Holly and the porter arguing begins insisting something about Holly loudly in German. Slowly, the assembled crowd turns to stare at Holly. Anna explains that the crowd thinks he is the murderer. He grabs Anna and they run away. The crowd pursues them, with the little boy in the lead. Holly and Anna duck into a movie theater, losing the mob. Holly tells Anna to go back home where she'll be safe.Holly eventually makes his way back to his hotel, where he asks the desk clerk for a taxi driver. The clerk indicates that an imposing-looking man standing there is a driver already waiting for him. With Holly in the back seat, the driver speeds off recklessly without Holly saying where he wants to go. Holly, very frightened, asks him if he is taking him to be killed. The driver does not answer and finally stops in front of a doorway. Holly, sure that he's about to be murdered, starts to run, but the door opens. Crabbin greets him, and Holly realizes it is time for the speaking engagement that he'd agreed to.Holly struggles with the intellectual questions posed to him. The audience begins to dissipate, while Crabbin agonizes over the misstep of hiring Holly. Unexpectedly, Popescu arrives, and he asks Holly if he's working on a book. Holly says that he's writing a book called ""The Third Man"" and that it's based on fact. Popescu suggests that Holly stick to fiction, but Holly insists he will finish this ""book."" As the meeting is closed, two thuggish-looking men arrive and get whispered orders from Popescu. Holly takes off up the spiral staircase at the back of the building and the two thugs pursue him. Holly ducks into in unlocked room, where he is bitten by an unexpected parrot. He makes his way out of a window and finds refuge from the thugs in a car hidden among the wartime rubble.Once safe, Holly goes to the international police station to tell Calloway about his findings. Calloway, though now convinced that Harry Lime was murdered, is still indifferent and explains that it's better that Harry is dead. Holly insists he is wrong, so the Major offers to show Holly why he believes Harry is guilty of racketeering and murder. Calloway then presents a myriad of evidence, proving that Harry obtained penicillin illegally, diluted it, and sold it to war-ravaged, poor hospitals, resulting in the painful deaths of many people. (Watered-down penicillin is not only ineffective, but it also makes the patient immune to future doses of penicillin, thus rendering medical treatment incredibly difficult or impossible.) Many of his victims were children with meningitis; the lucky ones, the Major says, died, and the unlucky ones lived and went insane. He shows Holly a slide of the hospital worker Joseph Harbin, who he explains helped steal the penicillin for Harry. The police forced Harbin to give them information about Harry's operation, but he has recently gone missing. Holly, now convinced of Harry's guilt, is devastated by the news about his old friend and agrees to go back to America.After Holly goes out to a bar and gets drunk, he buys flowers and takes them to Anna in her apartment. He drunkenly calls to Anna's cat, who is indifferent to him, and Anna explains the only person the cat ever liked was Harry. The cat slips out the window. Anna lets Holly know that Calloway also told her about Harry's misdeeds, and though she now believes in his guilt as well, it doesn't change her feelings for Harry.We then see a man outside Anna's window on the street. He ducks into a dark doorway. Anna's cat, who has run out of the apartment, curls up at his feet.In the apartment, Anna says Harry is better off dead, but not because he was punished for doing wrong, as Calloway believes. Holly agrees he's better off dead, and he no longer cares who killed him or why. He believes there was justice in Harry's death, and he says maybe he would have even killed Harry himself. He also tells Anna that he's fallen in love with her, but she makes it apparent that the feeling isn't mutual, as she thinks only of Harry.Disappointed and still drunk, Holly stumbles outside to return to his hotel, but he sees the obscured man standing in the dark doorway, the cat still at his feet. Holly shouts at him to stop spying and to show himself, but he does not move. Holly's noise causes a woman upstairs to turn on her light and open her window to yell at him to be quiet. The light from the woman's apartment shines down into the street, revealing the man in the doorway to be Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Harry smiles at a shocked Holly, but slips away when the woman turns off her light. Seeing Harry's shadow running off down a nearby street, Holly takes pursuit. He follows the sound of footsteps down a passageway that opens into a plaza, but once Holly reaches the end of the passageway, Harry is already gone.Holly brings Calloway and Paine out the area to re-enact the events, but they are unconvinced. However, suddenly a light bulb goes off for Calloway as he eyes a booth in the plaza. Opening the door on the booth, Calloway shows Holly that it is an entranceway to the Vienna sewers, with steps leading downwards. They follow the stairs into the sewers, where they see an endless range of tunnels for Harry to use as escape routes.That night, Calloway leads a team to excavate Harry's grave. When they open the coffin, the body inside is revealed to be that of Joseph Harbin.The international police come to Anna's apartment for her as she lies in bed crying in Harry's old pajamas. Anna surely assumes this is because of her forged papers. As she is led into the station, Holly sees her and yells at her that he's seen Harry alive. Calloway is standing in the hallway as the police lead her through the station, and he instructs them to bring her into his office. He interrogates her alone, asking when she saw Lime last. He explains in his coffin was Joseph Harbin's body. She looks thrilled as she realizes this does mean that Harry is alive, and she asks where he is. Calloway thinks she might know, but it is clear she was not aware he has been alive either. He says they know Harry is hiding in the Russian sector (which is where Kurtz lives, as he told Holly), and that if she helps them catch Lime, Calloway will help her with the Russians, who are about to interrogate her about her passport. She cannot help him, though, and he tells her they will catch him eventually, as Vienna is a closed city. She says that she wishes that he was dead, as he would be safe from ""all of you.""The next morning, Holly goes to visit Baron Kurtz's apartment in the Russian sector. Kurtz looks over his balcony and invites Holly up, but Holly refuses, as he shouts back that he wants to speak only with Harry. Dr. Winkel comes out on the balcony also, and he and Kurtz exchange concerned looks. Though they admit nothing about Harry, Holly insists that he come meet him at the nearby fairgrounds.As Holly waits next to the Ferris wheel, he spots Harry walking up to warmly greet him, acting as if nothing has changed. They go for a ride on the Ferris wheel. Harry shows no remorse for his penicillin racket, asking Holly about the people far below them if Holly would really care if one of ""those little dots"" stopped moving forever, especially if he were paid for each dot. When Holly reveals that he told the police about seeing Harry, Harry is very unhappy that Holly has been talking to the cops. Harry, staring at Holly, clearly considers shooting him and throwing him out of the Ferris wheel to his death. Holly takes him seriously enough to wrap his arm tightly around the car door should Harry try anything. However, when Holly also says that they've dug up his grave and found Harbin, Harry changes his mind and jokes that neither one of them would ever think of doing something to the other. Harry also reveals that he was the one who informed the Russian police about Anna's forged passport as payment for them letting him hide out in the Russian sector. As they finish the ride, Harry offers to cut Holly in on his schemes, but without waiting for an answer, Harry leaves quickly, telling him that they can meet again any time he wants, but no police.Holly goes to meet with Calloway and tells him he knows where Harry is staying. The Major tries to convince him to help them trap Harry by arranging to meet him at a cafe in the international zone. However, though Holly knows his friend has done wrong, he is unwilling to be the one to doom him. Just then, the Russian officer comes in with Anna's passport, explaining to Calloway that she must be deported. The Major mentions to him that the Russians were supposed to be helping the British police with Harry Lime, but the Russian says the two cases are not related and that they will get to his case eventually. He leaves the room, Anna's passport sitting on Calloway's desk. Calloway, seemingly resigned to Holly giving up in Harry's case, talks about how helpful Holly could have been in getting Lime, but Holly is staring at Anna's papers sitting on the desk. Holly asks what price would Calloway pay for his help, and he tells him to name it.Paine accompanies Anna to board the train that will save her from the Russian authorities. Just as she settles into her car, she spies Holly trying to see her off inconspicuously. Understanding that her leaving must have been part of a deal Holly struck with Calloway, she gets off the train and confronts Holly about why he's there. He admits he has agreed to ""betray"" Harry in turn for her getting away. Anna makes it evident that she's disgusted with Holly and could never do anything to hurt Harry. She leaves angrily, ripping up her passport, and allows the train to depart with her belongings.Now despondent, Holly asks that Calloway and Paine just take him to the airport, having changed his mind to help them catch Harry. He shows them Anna's torn up papers. Calloway agrees, but on the way to the airport, the Major makes an extra stop. It is the children's ward of a hospital, where Calloway shows Holly the devastating effects of Harry's dilluted penicillin. Horrified by the sight of painfully dying children, Holly reluctantly agrees again to entrap Harry.At a cafe Holly waits to meet Harry while Calloway, Paine, and several other policemen stake out nearby in the shadows. Anna comes into the cafe to admonish Holly, his location disclosed to her by Baron Kurtz as he was being arrested. While she talks to him, Harry has snuck in the back of the cafe. Just as Harry enters behind Anna, she yells at Holly for being a police informant. Harry reacts, drawing a gun to shoot Holly. Anna is standing in the way and tells Harry that he must escape or the police will get him. Harry tells Anna to move so he can kill Holly, but he spots Sergeant Paine entering the front of the cafe and turns to run.Harry rushes to the nearest sewer entrance and goes down into the tunnels. Paine, Calloway, Holly, and international policemen pursue Harry through the maze of sewer passages. Harry, for a time, evades the many men, but he is eventually cornered. Holly happens upon the panicked Harry and, hiding from the range of Harry's gun, tells him that he must give up. Sergeant Paine, followed by Calloway, comes rushing to Holly to warn him to get back, but Harry shoots Paine, and he falls. Harry tries to run but is shot by Calloway.Harry manages to crawl out of sight while Calloway leans over the dying Paine. Holly takes Paine's gun and sets off after Harry, and Calloway tells him to shoot on sight. In a passageway, badly wounded, Harry strains to climb up steps to escape through a sewer grate. He manages to make it to the top of the staircase, where he reaches his fingers up through the grate, feeling the air above. However, he is too weak to lift the manhole cover, and he drops his head into his arms. Holly walks up and aims the gun at Harry. Harry weakly lifts his head and nods slightly at Holly, a silent okay for Holly to mercy-kill him. A shot rings out in the sewers. Calloway sees the figure of Holly emerging from the passageway alone.Soon after, Harry again has another funeral in the same cemetery. Holly, Calloway, and Anna are the only attendees. After the service, Calloway begins to drive Holly to the airport. Seeing Anna walking behind them down the same tree-lined trail as the first time he saw her, Holly asks to get out to speak to her. Holly waits for Anna as she walks down the long road toward him. When she nears him, though, she does not acknowledge his presence and walks by. Holly doesn't say anything, but he puts his head down and lights a cigarette.

Stryker is an embittered man who takes his misery out on the men under his command. They're a bunch of green recruits who have a hard time dealing with Stryker's tough drills and thicker skin. Even his old friends start to wonder if he's gone from being the epitome of the tough Marine drill instructor to a man over the edge.One recruit in particular is a source of friction - Peter Conway. Conway's father was Stryker's CO at Guadalcanal and resented his son's seeming cowardice as a Marine, while Conway resents both Stryker's brutal leadership and seeming lack of sympathy for his men as well as the resentment he Conway feels is vented against him over his more relaxed conduct as a soldier. Another foe is Al Thomas, who was demoted by Stryker in previous action. The squad is assigned to take part in the November 1943 assault on the Japanese base at Tarawa. Stryker's brutal training regimen is now put to the test as the Marines must overcome a powerful underground bunker at the beach's edge; the bunker's machine gunners slaughter multiple Marines before Stryker succeeds in blowing up the position with satchel charges, and his bravery does not go unnoticed by his men. When Al Thomas and two other Marines, Charlie Bass and Hellenopolis, become separated from the main unit, Thomas runs to get fresh ammo for them - but rests for a moment when a Marine give him fresh hot coffee, a lapse that allows his two buddies to be jumped and bayoneted by Japanese Naval Landing troops. That night the beaten-up squad must guard the main approach to the beachhead, and they hear in the distance a man desperately calling for help. Stryker believes it to be a deception by the Japanese and he can't let anyone tip their position - which leads to an even grimmer dilemma when the voice calls out, ""Stryker!"" Peter Conway violently vows to find the man - but Stryker nearly shoots him dead to keep him from moving, and must sweat out the possibility of letting a fellow Marine die.The island is finally secured and wounded found and returned. Months later Charlie Bass returns to duty and queries about what happened to Al Thomas. Stryker then confronts Thomas and a fight erupts - broken up by a Marine Colonel. Thomas for his part profusely confesses he did wrong - and that he'd prefer to be dead himself than to have let his buddies die. Seeing Thomas' sincerity, Stryker is able to forge forgiveness.Turning to the bottle for comfort Stryker confronts his demons head on but then shows his soft side and helps out a widowed military wife and her child. Then the word comes down that they are being sent to Iwo Jima to do battle with 20,000 Japanese who've been dug into the most powerful island fortress of the war - a fortress so powerful that the largest continuing naval bombardment in history cannot dislodge the Japanese after three vicious days of combat, during which Conway saves Stryker's life when he is jumped by a Japanese soldier with sword. Finally Marines begin to advance up the island's largest rampart, Mount Suribachi, amid continuing fire from the US Fleet. The Marines reach the summit and Stryker sends four Marines to set up the US flag. But as Stryker now seems at peace, he is shot by a sniper, and Conway, Thomas, Bass, and the other Marines can only find and read an unfinished letter by Stryker to his son - just as the Marines raise the US flag atop the mountain.","

                    John Marion Stryker is the ultimate Marine, a tough rifle squad leader who in 1943 is assigned a squad of new recruits saddled with three veterans and an old enemy of Stryker's from previous duties in the Far East. One recruit in particlar is a source of friction with Stryker, Peter Conway, whose father was Stryker's CO at Guadalcanal and who felt his son was too soft and cowardly to be a Marine. The squad grows more and more resentful at Stryker's increasingly brutal training regimen and his lack of sympathy for the varied personal problems of the recruits, but his determination to mold them into fighting men helps save their lives when the squad is landed at Tarawa in November 1943 and Stryker risks his life to blow up a Japanese bunker that has slaughtered Marines trapped at a log wall. The now battle-tested squad becomes more closely-knit and Stryker's relationship with the men warms as the squad eventually finds itself in the bloodiest island battle of the war, at Iwo Jima.

    Synopsis
    1943. After his wife takes their son and leaves him, Sgt. John M. Stryker is an embittered man who takes his misery out on the men under his command. They're a bunch of green recruits who have a hard time dealing with Stryker's tough drills and thicker skin. Even his old friends start to wonder if he's gone from being the epitome of the tough Marine drill instructor to a man over the edge.One recruit in particular is a source of friction - Peter Conway. Conway's father was Stryker's CO at Guadalcanal and resented his son's seeming cowardice as a Marine, while Conway resents both Stryker's brutal leadership and seeming lack of sympathy for his men as well as the resentment he Conway feels is vented against him over his more relaxed conduct as a soldier. Another foe is Al Thomas, who was demoted by Stryker in previous action. The squad is assigned to take part in the November 1943 assault on the Japanese base at Tarawa. Stryker's brutal training regimen is now put to the test as the Marines must overcome a powerful underground bunker at the beach's edge; the bunker's machine gunners slaughter multiple Marines before Stryker succeeds in blowing up the position with satchel charges, and his bravery does not go unnoticed by his men. When Al Thomas and two other Marines, Charlie Bass and Hellenopolis, become separated from the main unit, Thomas runs to get fresh ammo for them - but rests for a moment when a Marine give him fresh hot coffee, a lapse that allows his two buddies to be jumped and bayoneted by Japanese Naval Landing troops. That night the beaten-up squad must guard the main approach to the beachhead, and they hear in the distance a man desperately calling for help. Stryker believes it to be a deception by the Japanese and he can't let anyone tip their position - which leads to an even grimmer dilemma when the voice calls out, ""Stryker!"" Peter Conway violently vows to find the man - but Stryker nearly shoots him dead to keep him from moving, and must sweat out the possibility of letting a fellow Marine die.The island is finally secured and wounded found and returned. Months later Charlie Bass returns to duty and queries about what happened to Al Thomas. Stryker then confronts Thomas and a fight erupts - broken up by a Marine Colonel. Thomas for his part profusely confesses he did wrong - and that he'd prefer to be dead himself than to have let his buddies die. Seeing Thomas' sincerity, Stryker is able to forge forgiveness.Turning to the bottle for comfort Stryker confronts his demons head on but then shows his soft side and helps out a widowed military wife and her child. Then the word comes down that they are being sent to Iwo Jima to do battle with 20,000 Japanese who've been dug into the most powerful island fortress of the war - a fortress so powerful that the largest continuing naval bombardment in history cannot dislodge the Japanese after three vicious days of combat, during which Conway saves Stryker's life when he is jumped by a Japanese soldier with sword. Finally Marines begin to advance up the island's largest rampart, Mount Suribachi, amid continuing fire from the US Fleet. The Marines reach the summit and Stryker sends four Marines to set up the US flag. But as Stryker now seems at peace, he is shot by a sniper, and Conway, Thomas, Bass, and the other Marines can only find and read an unfinished letter by Stryker to his son - just as the Marines raise the US flag atop the mountain.

Although married to Verna (Virginia Mayo), Jarrett is overly attached to his equally crooked and determined mother, 'Ma' Jarrett (Margaret Wycherly), who is his only real confidant. When he has one of his splitting headaches she consoles him, sits him on her lap and gives him a drink with the toast ""Top of the world"". Jarrett's father died in an institution. He himself is described as someone who when ""he was a kid, he used to fake headaches to get his mother's attention away from the rest of the family. It worked. As he grew up, the fancied headaches became real, until now they tear him to pieces.""Jarrett and his gang carry out a major robbery involving the hijacking of a train and the deaths of several people, including four members of the train crew and one of his own accomplices, Zuckie (Ford Rainey). With the help of informants, the police soon close in and Jarrett shoots and injures US Treasury investigator Philip Evans (John Archer). He escapes to Illinois and confesses to a lesser crime which was committed by an associate. It was done at a time to coincide with the train robbery and thus provides Jarrett with a perfect alibi. He is sentenced to one to three years of jail time.Evans is not fooled however. He allows Jarrett's conviction to go through but then sends an undercover agent into the penitentiary in order to get information from Jarrett as part of a sting operation. The agent is Hank Fallon (Edmond O'Brien), who goes by the name ""Vic Pardo."" His main task is to find the ""Trader"", a fence who launders stolen US Dollars on the European black market on Jarrett's behalf.'Big Ed' Somers (Steve Cochran), Jarrett's ambitious right-hand man, has designs on both Jarrett's gang and his treacherous wife Verna. He orders another convict, Roy Parker (Paul Guilfoyle), to kill him. In the prison workplace, Parker arranges to drop a heavy piece of machinery on Jarrett, but Fallon/Pardo pushes him out of the way and saves his life.When Ma visits, she insists she'll take care of Big Ed herself, despite Jarrett's attempts to dissuade her. He begins to worry and decides to break out. When he returns to the metal working shop after Ma's visit, he is overcome with another severe headache. Pardo covers for him and massages Cody's neck, helping him relive the pain. Cody is humbled and takes Pardo into his confidence. Pardo/Fallon suggests a means to escape that will entail a minimum of risk (he'll have the help of his colleagues on the outside who will then follow them). However, during dinner on the day of the escape, Jarrett learns from the prison grapevine that Ma now is dead and goes berserk in the mess hall.Held in the infirmary in a straight-jacket, Jarrett persuades another convict, Tommy Ryley (Robert Osterloh), to give him a gun which Ryley has managed to stash away. Holding various officials hostage, Jarrett escapes along with Fallon/Pardo, their cellmates and Parker, who is locked in the trunk of the car they use to drive out. Evans and his men were due to follow Jarrett and Fallon, but, on learning of Jarrett being held in the infirmary, called the whole thing off. When the convicts do escape they react too slowly to intercept them.Cody's gang escapes to the mountains of California where they murder a family and steal their car. As they leave the house Parker, still in the trunk of the car used to escape the prison, complains ""It's stuffy, I need some air"" Jarrett replies ""Oh, stuffy, huh? I'll give ya a little air"" and ""creates"" some air holes by emptying his gun into the trunk.Ma was shot in the back by Verna when she faced Big Ed. Verna wants to get away, but Big Ed is resolved to confront Jarrett and end it all. When Verna tries to slip away discreetly she is seized by her husband and is quick to convince him that Ma was murdered by Big Ed. Jarrett kills Big Ed.The gang is now double in size with the other escapees, including Fallon/Pardo for whom Jarrett appears to have a genuine liking for. He even appears to look on him as a kind of Ma-substitute, insisting that they will share the proceeds from their robberies: ""I split even with Ma, didn't I?"". ""I'll practice up on my lullabies,"" mutters Fallon, but not in Jarrett's presence.While the gang prepares its next heist, a fisherman arrives at the country hideout asking to use the phone. The gang expects him to be murdered and Fallon follows him and Jarrett into the house in order to prevent any killing. In conversation, Fallon exposes the fisherman as a phony. He is in fact Jarrett's fence the Trader (Fred Clark), the man Fallon is really after. Jarrett, who never trusted any of his other accomplices with the Trader's identity, with the possible exception of Ma, makes the introductions as if Fallon/Pardo is a trustworthy as she was.Jarrett intends to rob the payroll at a chemical plant in Long Beach, California. The gang has a huge gas truck and an accomplice who works there. The plan in to use the gas truck as a Trojan Horse in order to get into the plant discreetly and steal the money.Verna's radio has broken down and Fallon/Pardo offers to fix it. In fact he converts it into sending a signal which his law-enforcement colleagues will be able to pick up and thus track him down. He places the radio under the truck before the gang sets off.While on their way to the plant they stop at a gas station in order to have the engine checked. Fallon goes into the washroom and uses the soap in order to leave a message on the mirror for Evans. The gas station attendant alerts Evans, the T-Men track the signal given off by the hidden radio and triangulate it to the target, the chemical plant.The gang gets into the plant hidden in the gas truck. Guided by the ex-con driver they get to the office where the payroll is hidden in the safe. But the driver turns out to be Bo Creel (Ian MacDonald) who recognizes Pardo as Fallon, a cop who arrested him a few years ago (Creel was even in the prison earlier on and Pardo had to stage a fight in order to avoid meeting him face-to-face).The police surround the building and Evans calls on Jarrett to surrender. On realizing Pardo's deception however, Jarrett goes completely round-the-bend and resolves to fight it out. When the police fire tear gas into the building, Fallon manages to escape the gang. Verna is arrested in a getaway car outside the plant. Fallon also gives the Trader's present location.Jarrett is pursued to the top of a gigantic gas storage tank. His accomplices are shot by the police, or by Jarrett himself when they try to give themselves up. When Fallon shoots Jarrett with a rifle, he starts firing holes into the tank and goes up in what for him is a blaze of glory: ""Made it, Ma! Top of the world!""","

    Synopsis
    Cody Jarrett (James Cagney) is the ruthless, deranged leader of a criminal gang. Although married to Verna (Virginia Mayo), Jarrett is overly attached to his equally crooked and determined mother, 'Ma' Jarrett (Margaret Wycherly), who is his only real confidant. When he has one of his splitting headaches she consoles him, sits him on her lap and gives him a drink with the toast ""Top of the world"". Jarrett's father died in an institution. He himself is described as someone who when ""he was a kid, he used to fake headaches to get his mother's attention away from the rest of the family. It worked. As he grew up, the fancied headaches became real, until now they tear him to pieces.""Jarrett and his gang carry out a major robbery involving the hijacking of a train and the deaths of several people, including four members of the train crew and one of his own accomplices, Zuckie (Ford Rainey). With the help of informants, the police soon close in and Jarrett shoots and injures US Treasury investigator Philip Evans (John Archer). He escapes to Illinois and confesses to a lesser crime which was committed by an associate. It was done at a time to coincide with the train robbery and thus provides Jarrett with a perfect alibi. He is sentenced to one to three years of jail time.Evans is not fooled however. He allows Jarrett's conviction to go through but then sends an undercover agent into the penitentiary in order to get information from Jarrett as part of a sting operation. The agent is Hank Fallon (Edmond O'Brien), who goes by the name ""Vic Pardo."" His main task is to find the ""Trader"", a fence who launders stolen US Dollars on the European black market on Jarrett's behalf.'Big Ed' Somers (Steve Cochran), Jarrett's ambitious right-hand man, has designs on both Jarrett's gang and his treacherous wife Verna. He orders another convict, Roy Parker (Paul Guilfoyle), to kill him. In the prison workplace, Parker arranges to drop a heavy piece of machinery on Jarrett, but Fallon/Pardo pushes him out of the way and saves his life.When Ma visits, she insists she'll take care of Big Ed herself, despite Jarrett's attempts to dissuade her. He begins to worry and decides to break out. When he returns to the metal working shop after Ma's visit, he is overcome with another severe headache. Pardo covers for him and massages Cody's neck, helping him relive the pain. Cody is humbled and takes Pardo into his confidence. Pardo/Fallon suggests a means to escape that will entail a minimum of risk (he'll have the help of his colleagues on the outside who will then follow them). However, during dinner on the day of the escape, Jarrett learns from the prison grapevine that Ma now is dead and goes berserk in the mess hall.Held in the infirmary in a straight-jacket, Jarrett persuades another convict, Tommy Ryley (Robert Osterloh), to give him a gun which Ryley has managed to stash away. Holding various officials hostage, Jarrett escapes along with Fallon/Pardo, their cellmates and Parker, who is locked in the trunk of the car they use to drive out. Evans and his men were due to follow Jarrett and Fallon, but, on learning of Jarrett being held in the infirmary, called the whole thing off. When the convicts do escape they react too slowly to intercept them.Cody's gang escapes to the mountains of California where they murder a family and steal their car. As they leave the house Parker, still in the trunk of the car used to escape the prison, complains ""It's stuffy, I need some air"" Jarrett replies ""Oh, stuffy, huh? I'll give ya a little air"" and ""creates"" some air holes by emptying his gun into the trunk.Ma was shot in the back by Verna when she faced Big Ed. Verna wants to get away, but Big Ed is resolved to confront Jarrett and end it all. When Verna tries to slip away discreetly she is seized by her husband and is quick to convince him that Ma was murdered by Big Ed. Jarrett kills Big Ed.The gang is now double in size with the other escapees, including Fallon/Pardo for whom Jarrett appears to have a genuine liking for. He even appears to look on him as a kind of Ma-substitute, insisting that they will share the proceeds from their robberies: ""I split even with Ma, didn't I?"". ""I'll practice up on my lullabies,"" mutters Fallon, but not in Jarrett's presence.While the gang prepares its next heist, a fisherman arrives at the country hideout asking to use the phone. The gang expects him to be murdered and Fallon follows him and Jarrett into the house in order to prevent any killing. In conversation, Fallon exposes the fisherman as a phony. He is in fact Jarrett's fence the Trader (Fred Clark), the man Fallon is really after. Jarrett, who never trusted any of his other accomplices with the Trader's identity, with the possible exception of Ma, makes the introductions as if Fallon/Pardo is a trustworthy as she was.Jarrett intends to rob the payroll at a chemical plant in Long Beach, California. The gang has a huge gas truck and an accomplice who works there. The plan in to use the gas truck as a Trojan Horse in order to get into the plant discreetly and steal the money.Verna's radio has broken down and Fallon/Pardo offers to fix it. In fact he converts it into sending a signal which his law-enforcement colleagues will be able to pick up and thus track him down. He places the radio under the truck before the gang sets off.While on their way to the plant they stop at a gas station in order to have the engine checked. Fallon goes into the washroom and uses the soap in order to leave a message on the mirror for Evans. The gas station attendant alerts Evans, the T-Men track the signal given off by the hidden radio and triangulate it to the target, the chemical plant.The gang gets into the plant hidden in the gas truck. Guided by the ex-con driver they get to the office where the payroll is hidden in the safe. But the driver turns out to be Bo Creel (Ian MacDonald) who recognizes Pardo as Fallon, a cop who arrested him a few years ago (Creel was even in the prison earlier on and Pardo had to stage a fight in order to avoid meeting him face-to-face).The police surround the building and Evans calls on Jarrett to surrender. On realizing Pardo's deception however, Jarrett goes completely round-the-bend and resolves to fight it out. When the police fire tear gas into the building, Fallon manages to escape the gang. Verna is arrested in a getaway car outside the plant. Fallon also gives the Trader's present location.Jarrett is pursued to the top of a gigantic gas storage tank. His accomplices are shot by the police, or by Jarrett himself when they try to give themselves up. When Fallon shoots Jarrett with a rifle, he starts firing holes into the tank and goes up in what for him is a blaze of glory: ""Made it, Ma! Top of the world!""

The problem Trent faces is that no one wants to work with the two hammy actors. To solve part of Trent's problem, he hires Carson to direct the picture. Carson helming the production leads to further problems in trying to find a leading lady, as anyone of respectability knows that Carson will give himself all the screen time. Meanwhile, small town girl Judy Adams has just arrived in Hollywood and is working at the Warner Bros. commissary. She wants to break into pictures and does whatever she can to meet anyone at the studio who can help her. Initially, neither Morgan or Carson give her the time of day, but Morgan convinces Carson that she is the perfect person to star in the movie if only to get the project off the ground. They, however face an uphill battle in convincing Trent. Carson and Morgan try one hair-brained scheme after another to showcase Judy to a frazzled Trent. Ultimately, Morgan and Carson do believe that Judy has star potential and want to help her even if it's not starring in ""Mademoiselle Fifi"". They have to balance their want to get Judy onto the big screen against her competing priority of marrying Jeffrey Bushdinkle, the supposedly hayseed farmer boy waiting for her at home in Goerkes Corner, Wisconsin.

"12","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041386/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Howard Roark (Gary Cooper) has just left university. He is told off by the dean (Paul Stanton), as he does not want to know anything about history or how buildings were built in the past; he is only interested in the modern possibilities of building. That forces the dean to take the matter on his own hands and expel him. But Roark has already decided that he wants to work for only one person: Henry Cameron (Henry Hull). Even Peter Keating (Ken Smith), his fellow student and good friend, advises him not to follow that career path, as Cameron was a renown architect thirty years before, but these days he is a finished man. Howard does not listen. He is admitted by Cameron because of the project he has designed, although Cameron himself tells him that he will be finished like him in a few years. Cameron recognises Roark's talents and hires him.Some years later, Cameron is making a scene of himself at the train station. He's drunk and buying copies of the yellow-press newspaper The Banner just to tear its pages away. The newsboy (Bob Alden) does not know what to do about it. A police officer (Paul Newlan) appears and is about to arrest him. Roark kindly takes him to their office. Cameron is a broken man: back at the office, he picks up a t-square and thrusts it into a window pane; then, he has a fit and passes out on the floor. Roark goes with him to hospital in an ambulance. There, Cameron knows he's about to die, and he makes Roark promise that he will burn every document Cameron has. Also, Cameron advises Roark to compromise, or he will end up like Cameron.A year and a half later, Roark is still burning documents from late Cameron. He can't burn the design of a special building which Cameron had thought of but was never built: the building is very modern-looking, only made of glass and metal, without balconies, decoration or distractions on the outside. Keating visits Roark. Peter is successful and rich because he has compromised and catered for the middle taste. Meanwhile, Roark is about to be evicted, has plenty of bills and has only 14.74 dollars to his name.Roark is anxiously waiting for news from the commission to the starship building for the Security Bank of Manhattan. Roark is said that his building is so original, and that he will have to wait until the decision is made. However, the following Monday he is said that he has won the commission. However, Roark is said that certain changes will have to be made. Instead of a simple glass and metal façade, reminiscent of the Cameron design, they have prepared certain changes. The board of directors (Bert Howard and Sam Harris) insist to pout a Greek-temple looking entrance to the building, and to plaster some rococo stonework on one of the sides. Obviously, Roark refuses to sign the contract on those conditions. Roark decides to skip the commission and work even as a day labourer if necessary. For Roark, it's a difficult decision, of course, but he finally leaves with the maps to the building and storms off banging the door. The board of directors turn to a figure on the shadows who has said nothing but was present throughout the ordeal. Ellsworth M. Toohey (Robert Douglas) had convinced the board to give an opportunity to Howard Roark as long as he accepted the changes. The board feels appalled when Roark rejects their offer, so they turn to Toohey, who says that it was all an experiment, but that he knew that their offer was going to be rejected and that they have to offer the commission to some other architect. Toohey mutters that Gail Wynand expects to have some classic element in his buildings.At The Banner , Gail Wynand (Raymond Massey) asks which architect Toohey recommended to the Security Bank, as he has the controlling interest over the bank, and Toohey recommends Peter Keating. Gail seems keen on accepting Keating, as Toohey says that Peter has not got a personality of his own, he just copies the ideas of the average man, and presents Wynand with examples of Keating's work. Gail deems the examples ""marble monstrosities"", but he says that he will accept the advice of the architectural experts of The Banner. Toohey is pleased, but Wynand points that Toohey is not the only critic on the newspaper. There is another one, Dominique Francon (Patricia Neal). Toohey is apprehensive, as he and Francon do not always agree. The secretary of Wynand (Ann Doran) cannot get hold of Francon because she is not in the building. Wynand goes to seek her at her place.Cue to Dominique: she is throwing a small Greek statue from the window of her condo. Gail Wynand enters the place unanounced. She justified herself saying that she destroyed the statue because she used to love it and she doesn't accept to be slave to anything or anyone. When she is asked, she says that she has never known an architect of ability. Wynand mentions that Toohey wants Keating chosen, and that Keating is Guy Francon (Jonathan Hale)'s partner - Guy being Dominique's father. Moreover, she is engaged to Peter Keating, but she will not recommend Keating anyway. They are all going to dine together to discuss the commission. Wynand tells Dominique that she could make a brilliant career at The Banner , and that he would have fired anyone absent from work. Dominique does not care one way or another. At dinner, Gail offers Peter the commission of the Security Bank as long as he breaks his engagement to Miss Francon. At the beginning, Peter is outraged, but Dominique keeps a blank face, and states that she won't help Peter in this occasion. Peter gladly leaves Dominique. When Gail and her are left alone, he tells her that there are no men of honesty. He tries to kiss her, but she is frozen and incapable of love; in fact, she states that she has never been in love with anyone. She says that she will marry Gail some day if she wanted to punish herself of some unredeemable guilt, and he seems contented in spite of her reasons.Dominique leaves for the countryside. Her father's manor house is close to a quarry. He takes notice of a mature strong quarryman - Howard Roark -. They take a look at each other. She asks the quarry superintendent (Harry Woods) to show her around. The following days, they stare at each other, until Miss Francon opens the fire and tells Roark to stop staring or be fired. He mocks her airs and attitude. Back at her home, Dominique breaks on purpose a marble piece of the mantelpiece in her room. Roark is sent to replace the marble, and he immediately spots that it got broken on purpose. When pressed on to speak about something, Howard mentions that the fireplace is atrocious - it really is: it is heavy, it has been profusely decorated and cries new money everywhere -. She tells him that the home was designed by Guy Francon himself. He rambles about the quality of the marble and how marble gets formed. Some time afterwards, the maid (Almira Sessions) lets a different marble worker in, Pasquale Orsini (Tito Vuolo), to have the broken piece replaced. Dominique pretends to have forgotten everything about it to hide her confusion, and while Pasquale works on it, she runs after Howard on her horse. She ends up hitting Howard with her fuste. At night, Howard appears on her room, and after another fight and some pushing and shoving, they kiss passionately. She tries to run away. Howard leaves her on the floor, crying her heart out. Back to his humble home, he has received the telegram of Roger Enright (Ray Collins) telling him that he wants him to build a building for him. After a second, Howard packs his staff and leaves. The following morning, Dominique asks the supervisor about Howard, but she is told that he has left, maybe for New York. She is about to inquire about his name, but she leaves before giving in to the tender thought.Back at The Banner , the editor, called Alvah (Jerome Cowan), is looking for ideas to denounce on the first page. The newspaper sells more when it falls onto a crusade against something, he says. Toohey suggests the Enright building, a luxury apartment building whose new building methods make it modern, ""about to crumble down"" and weird looking. Enright is a self-made man, who is ""stubborn and rich as blazes"", and a crusade against the rich will always attract the masses. Dominique looks at the photograph and asks about the architect, and she is said ""Howard Roark"", but the name says nothing to her. The editor is enthusiastic, and phones Wynand to tell him of the plan. Dominique asks Toohey whether he can recognise it as a great building - he does -, and she also asks about his motives, which he does not want to proclaim at that moment. Wynand goes on with the story even with Dominique's - who thinks that the building is a ""great architectural achievement""- opposition. She asks him to call off the campaign, but he says that he will give everything except for The Banner , so Dominique resigns on the spot. Wynand tells him that she will not be able to fight him.Toohey starts his defamation campaign, and all the rest of architects sign a petition against him. The building gets done anyway. Enright himself will move onto the house and give an inauguration party. Dominique attends the party and wants to meet Roark. Peter tells her that he is taking a poll among the guests (Lois Austin, Jay Eaton, Thurston Hall, Dorothy Christy & Harold Miller) knowing that they will agree with his opinion - the building is too original, too weird, too unadorned, and nobody would feel comfortable enough on it to call it ""home"". Even Guy Francon agrees that the building would need more ""Greek ornaments"" to be nice, but Dominique likes it as it is. Dominique is terrified when she recognises Roark, but she has nowhere to hide. Enright says that she understands Roark and that she quit to defend the building in front of him. Roark is surprised about that.Afterwards, Dominique and Howard are alone and she tells him that she admires him, but that people will destroy him: in fact, he has not not offered a single job after the crusade of the newspaper. They kiss again. She even asks him to marry her. He refuses point blank. Roark is sure he will not be destroyed, and that when she learns to be independent from the masses' opinion, she can go back to him. Dominique goes right away to welcome Gail, back from his world voyage. She asks him to marry her even though he knows she does not love him.Roark is refused the commission for the Civic Opera Company of New York by a director (Paul Harvey) who is afraid of sticking his neck out. He also sees the mayhem outside the wedding venue of Dominique and Gail, full of paparazzi. Francon and Keating have won the commission for the Civil Opera House. The onlookers (Glen Cavender & Leo White) do not pay attention to him. Suddenly, Toohey comes Roark across and encourages Roark to express what he feels about the critic to his face. Roark says that he does not think of him at all.A gas station owner (Monte Blue) wants Roark to build his station. Afterwards, Roark designs a farm, a home in the country, an office building, a factory... all with concrete, resulting in clean lines, no extra decorations or windows... nothing which is not required for the purpose of the building.Howard Roark succeeds enough far from New York to have an office of his own - designed with clean lines, the same as his buildings. His secretary (Ruthelma Stevens) tells him of a new commission for... Gail Wynand. He wants him to build a countryhouse to imprison Dominique there. Wynand admits that he likes Roark's work. Finally, Roark accepts the job.Obviously, Dominique gets really upset - not at the idea of the manor countryhouse, but at the prospect of Roark being the architect. She accuses Wynand of being away on his yacht while The Banner 's smear campaign was fully marching on. She tells Wynand that Roark has won over him; but Wyland wants to hold the upper hand. He proposes Roark to be the sole architect of all the buildings The Banner  or him will erect in the future. Wynand says that he will build all the commercial buildings as the public wants to see them: ""colonial houses, Rococo hotels and semi-Grecian office buildings"". Roark agrees and sets to make a drawing project: he draws a hut. Wyland laughs it off. Roark says they are equal; after all, Wynand rose from Hell's Kitchen onto becoming a rich self-made man, although he was mistaken on the path of career. Wynand invites him over for dinner. There, they both feel like victors. At first, Dominique says she will not be able to live in Roark's designed house, but then she gives in.Meanwhile, Keating is lost: he has been losing contracts since Guy Francon died. Toohey says that he should ask himself if there ever was reason for him to succeed. Keating wants to be chosen as the architect for the Cortland House project. Toohey explains at length that the economic side of the matter is the main problem for the accommodation of the poorer classes, so everybody is searching for an idea to solve the equation.Keating goes to Roark, admitting that he has never had an original idea by himself. Roark admits that he has thought the problem over, but never proposed anything because he had never been granted anything for any committee. He will give the solution to Keating as long as he guarantees that nothing will be changed from the project. The project will carry Keating's signature, and nobody will know of the truth.""Keating's"" project wins the commission. Only Wynand and Dominique recognise it as coming from Roark. Wynand invites Roark for a several-month voyage. Dominique is jealous of Roark and asks him to refuse it, but he accepts. When they come back from the yacht trip, Gordon Prescott (Frank Wilcox) and Gus Webb (John Doucette) have been appointed as side architects to the Cortlandt project. They want to add decorations, colours, balconies... and they did. Obviously, Roark is not happy. Keating says that they started changing details for no reason at all and that he couldn't do anything to stop them. Roark starts to devise a plan.Dominique appears to tell him she loves him and that she is leaving Gail. He asks her to go to a side of Cortlandt Homes pretending to be an innocent bystander. She says to the old watchman (Fred Kelsey) that she has run out of petrol. She offers him some money to go and fetch somebody (Selmer Jackson) to help her as the telephone is out of order. She jumps to a hole on the ground while everything explodes around her. The watchman sees Howard standing next to the detonator, waiting for them to take him to court.

Roark tells her to stay with Gail, just in case he loses his case at court.Toohey asks Keating whether he truly designed Cortlandt. He admits he didn't.

Roark stands up and tells the judge (Griff Barnett) that he has no witness apart from himself. The court clerk (Tom Coleman) takes his oath. He gives a speech in which he stresses the rights of personal will, honesty and ambition. Copying is made for looters. He says that his price for solving the problem of Cortlandt was to see it built exactly as he intended, so he was not paid and he had nowhere to complain: that's why he did what he did.The judge stresses to the jurors that no financial issue is being discussed at the moment.

    Synopsis
    Howard Roark (Gary Cooper) has just left university. He is told off by the dean (Paul Stanton), as he does not want to know anything about history or how buildings were built in the past; he is only interested in the modern possibilities of building. That forces the dean to take the matter on his own hands and expel him. But Roark has already decided that he wants to work for only one person: Henry Cameron (Henry Hull). Even Peter Keating (Ken Smith), his fellow student and good friend, advises him not to follow that career path, as Cameron was a renown architect thirty years before, but these days he is a finished man. Howard does not listen. He is admitted by Cameron because of the project he has designed, although Cameron himself tells him that he will be finished like him in a few years. Cameron recognises Roark's talents and hires him.Some years later, Cameron is making a scene of himself at the train station. He's drunk and buying copies of the yellow-press newspaper The Banner just to tear its pages away. The newsboy (Bob Alden) does not know what to do about it. A police officer (Paul Newlan) appears and is about to arrest him. Roark kindly takes him to their office. Cameron is a broken man: back at the office, he picks up a t-square and thrusts it into a window pane; then, he has a fit and passes out on the floor. Roark goes with him to hospital in an ambulance. There, Cameron knows he's about to die, and he makes Roark promise that he will burn every document Cameron has. Also, Cameron advises Roark to compromise, or he will end up like Cameron.A year and a half later, Roark is still burning documents from late Cameron. He can't burn the design of a special building which Cameron had thought of but was never built: the building is very modern-looking, only made of glass and metal, without balconies, decoration or distractions on the outside. Keating visits Roark. Peter is successful and rich because he has compromised and catered for the middle taste. Meanwhile, Roark is about to be evicted, has plenty of bills and has only 14.74 dollars to his name.Roark is anxiously waiting for news from the commission to the starship building for the Security Bank of Manhattan. Roark is said that his building is so original, and that he will have to wait until the decision is made. However, the following Monday he is said that he has won the commission. However, Roark is said that certain changes will have to be made. Instead of a simple glass and metal façade, reminiscent of the Cameron design, they have prepared certain changes. The board of directors (Bert Howard and Sam Harris) insist to pout a Greek-temple looking entrance to the building, and to plaster some rococo stonework on one of the sides. Obviously, Roark refuses to sign the contract on those conditions. Roark decides to skip the commission and work even as a day labourer if necessary. For Roark, it's a difficult decision, of course, but he finally leaves with the maps to the building and storms off banging the door. The board of directors turn to a figure on the shadows who has said nothing but was present throughout the ordeal. Ellsworth M. Toohey (Robert Douglas) had convinced the board to give an opportunity to Howard Roark as long as he accepted the changes. The board feels appalled when Roark rejects their offer, so they turn to Toohey, who says that it was all an experiment, but that he knew that their offer was going to be rejected and that they have to offer the commission to some other architect. Toohey mutters that Gail Wynand expects to have some classic element in his buildings.At The Banner , Gail Wynand (Raymond Massey) asks which architect Toohey recommended to the Security Bank, as he has the controlling interest over the bank, and Toohey recommends Peter Keating. Gail seems keen on accepting Keating, as Toohey says that Peter has not got a personality of his own, he just copies the ideas of the average man, and presents Wynand with examples of Keating's work. Gail deems the examples ""marble monstrosities"", but he says that he will accept the advice of the architectural experts of The Banner. Toohey is pleased, but Wynand points that Toohey is not the only critic on the newspaper. There is another one, Dominique Francon (Patricia Neal). Toohey is apprehensive, as he and Francon do not always agree. The secretary of Wynand (Ann Doran) cannot get hold of Francon because she is not in the building. Wynand goes to seek her at her place.Cue to Dominique: she is throwing a small Greek statue from the window of her condo. Gail Wynand enters the place unanounced. She justified herself saying that she destroyed the statue because she used to love it and she doesn't accept to be slave to anything or anyone. When she is asked, she says that she has never known an architect of ability. Wynand mentions that Toohey wants Keating chosen, and that Keating is Guy Francon (Jonathan Hale)'s partner - Guy being Dominique's father. Moreover, she is engaged to Peter Keating, but she will not recommend Keating anyway. They are all going to dine together to discuss the commission. Wynand tells Dominique that she could make a brilliant career at The Banner , and that he would have fired anyone absent from work. Dominique does not care one way or another. At dinner, Gail offers Peter the commission of the Security Bank as long as he breaks his engagement to Miss Francon. At the beginning, Peter is outraged, but Dominique keeps a blank face, and states that she won't help Peter in this occasion. Peter gladly leaves Dominique. When Gail and her are left alone, he tells her that there are no men of honesty. He tries to kiss her, but she is frozen and incapable of love; in fact, she states that she has never been in love with anyone. She says that she will marry Gail some day if she wanted to punish herself of some unredeemable guilt, and he seems contented in spite of her reasons.Dominique leaves for the countryside. Her father's manor house is close to a quarry. He takes notice of a mature strong quarryman - Howard Roark -. They take a look at each other. She asks the quarry superintendent (Harry Woods) to show her around. The following days, they stare at each other, until Miss Francon opens the fire and tells Roark to stop staring or be fired. He mocks her airs and attitude. Back at her home, Dominique breaks on purpose a marble piece of the mantelpiece in her room. Roark is sent to replace the marble, and he immediately spots that it got broken on purpose. When pressed on to speak about something, Howard mentions that the fireplace is atrocious - it really is: it is heavy, it has been profusely decorated and cries new money everywhere -. She tells him that the home was designed by Guy Francon himself. He rambles about the quality of the marble and how marble gets formed. Some time afterwards, the maid (Almira Sessions) lets a different marble worker in, Pasquale Orsini (Tito Vuolo), to have the broken piece replaced. Dominique pretends to have forgotten everything about it to hide her confusion, and while Pasquale works on it, she runs after Howard on her horse. She ends up hitting Howard with her fuste. At night, Howard appears on her room, and after another fight and some pushing and shoving, they kiss passionately. She tries to run away. Howard leaves her on the floor, crying her heart out. Back to his humble home, he has received the telegram of Roger Enright (Ray Collins) telling him that he wants him to build a building for him. After a second, Howard packs his staff and leaves. The following morning, Dominique asks the supervisor about Howard, but she is told that he has left, maybe for New York. She is about to inquire about his name, but she leaves before giving in to the tender thought.Back at The Banner , the editor, called Alvah (Jerome Cowan), is looking for ideas to denounce on the first page. The newspaper sells more when it falls onto a crusade against something, he says. Toohey suggests the Enright building, a luxury apartment building whose new building methods make it modern, ""about to crumble down"" and weird looking. Enright is a self-made man, who is ""stubborn and rich as blazes"", and a crusade against the rich will always attract the masses. Dominique looks at the photograph and asks about the architect, and she is said ""Howard Roark"", but the name says nothing to her. The editor is enthusiastic, and phones Wynand to tell him of the plan. Dominique asks Toohey whether he can recognise it as a great building - he does -, and she also asks about his motives, which he does not want to proclaim at that moment. Wynand goes on with the story even with Dominique's - who thinks that the building is a ""great architectural achievement""- opposition. She asks him to call off the campaign, but he says that he will give everything except for The Banner , so Dominique resigns on the spot. Wynand tells him that she will not be able to fight him.Toohey starts his defamation campaign, and all the rest of architects sign a petition against him. The building gets done anyway. Enright himself will move onto the house and give an inauguration party. Dominique attends the party and wants to meet Roark. Peter tells her that he is taking a poll among the guests (Lois Austin, Jay Eaton, Thurston Hall, Dorothy Christy & Harold Miller) knowing that they will agree with his opinion - the building is too original, too weird, too unadorned, and nobody would feel comfortable enough on it to call it ""home"". Even Guy Francon agrees that the building would need more ""Greek ornaments"" to be nice, but Dominique likes it as it is. Dominique is terrified when she recognises Roark, but she has nowhere to hide. Enright says that she understands Roark and that she quit to defend the building in front of him. Roark is surprised about that.Afterwards, Dominique and Howard are alone and she tells him that she admires him, but that people will destroy him: in fact, he has not not offered a single job after the crusade of the newspaper. They kiss again. She even asks him to marry her. He refuses point blank. Roark is sure he will not be destroyed, and that when she learns to be independent from the masses' opinion, she can go back to him. Dominique goes right away to welcome Gail, back from his world voyage. She asks him to marry her even though he knows she does not love him.Roark is refused the commission for the Civic Opera Company of New York by a director (Paul Harvey) who is afraid of sticking his neck out. He also sees the mayhem outside the wedding venue of Dominique and Gail, full of paparazzi. Francon and Keating have won the commission for the Civil Opera House. The onlookers (Glen Cavender & Leo White) do not pay attention to him. Suddenly, Toohey comes Roark across and encourages Roark to express what he feels about the critic to his face. Roark says that he does not think of him at all.A gas station owner (Monte Blue) wants Roark to build his station. Afterwards, Roark designs a farm, a home in the country, an office building, a factory... all with concrete, resulting in clean lines, no extra decorations or windows... nothing which is not required for the purpose of the building.Howard Roark succeeds enough far from New York to have an office of his own - designed with clean lines, the same as his buildings. His secretary (Ruthelma Stevens) tells him of a new commission for... Gail Wynand. He wants him to build a countryhouse to imprison Dominique there. Wynand admits that he likes Roark's work. Finally, Roark accepts the job.Obviously, Dominique gets really upset - not at the idea of the manor countryhouse, but at the prospect of Roark being the architect. She accuses Wynand of being away on his yacht while The Banner 's smear campaign was fully marching on. She tells Wynand that Roark has won over him; but Wyland wants to hold the upper hand. He proposes Roark to be the sole architect of all the buildings The Banner  or him will erect in the future. Wynand says that he will build all the commercial buildings as the public wants to see them: ""colonial houses, Rococo hotels and semi-Grecian office buildings"". Roark agrees and sets to make a drawing project: he draws a hut. Wyland laughs it off. Roark says they are equal; after all, Wynand rose from Hell's Kitchen onto becoming a rich self-made man, although he was mistaken on the path of career. Wynand invites him over for dinner. There, they both feel like victors. At first, Dominique says she will not be able to live in Roark's designed house, but then she gives in.Meanwhile, Keating is lost: he has been losing contracts since Guy Francon died. Toohey says that he should ask himself if there ever was reason for him to succeed. Keating wants to be chosen as the architect for the Cortland House project. Toohey explains at length that the economic side of the matter is the main problem for the accommodation of the poorer classes, so everybody is searching for an idea to solve the equation.Keating goes to Roark, admitting that he has never had an original idea by himself. Roark admits that he has thought the problem over, but never proposed anything because he had never been granted anything for any committee. He will give the solution to Keating as long as he guarantees that nothing will be changed from the project. The project will carry Keating's signature, and nobody will know of the truth.""Keating's"" project wins the commission. Only Wynand and Dominique recognise it as coming from Roark. Wynand invites Roark for a several-month voyage. Dominique is jealous of Roark and asks him to refuse it, but he accepts. When they come back from the yacht trip, Gordon Prescott (Frank Wilcox) and Gus Webb (John Doucette) have been appointed as side architects to the Cortlandt project. They want to add decorations, colours, balconies... and they did. Obviously, Roark is not happy. Keating says that they started changing details for no reason at all and that he couldn't do anything to stop them. Roark starts to devise a plan.Dominique appears to tell him she loves him and that she is leaving Gail. He asks her to go to a side of Cortlandt Homes pretending to be an innocent bystander. She says to the old watchman (Fred Kelsey) that she has run out of petrol. She offers him some money to go and fetch somebody (Selmer Jackson) to help her as the telephone is out of order. She jumps to a hole on the ground while everything explodes around her. The watchman sees Howard standing next to the detonator, waiting for them to take him to court. Alone, Dominique runs to her car with a piece of broken glass, and tries to commit suicide by slashing off her wrists.Toohey starts giving speeches about self-sacrifice to different groups of people against Roark, and Wynand is the only person who will publicly defend Roark.

                    In the mid-1800's, the wealthy Sloper family - widowed surgeon Dr. Austin Sloper, his adult daughter Catherine Sloper (Dr. Sloper's only surviving child), and Dr. Sloper's recently widowed sister Lavinia Penniman - live in an opulent house at 16 Washington Square, New York City. They have accrued their wealth largely through Dr. Sloper's hard work. Despite the lessons that Dr. Sloper has paid for in all the social graces for her, Catherine is a plain, simple, awkward and extremely shy woman who spends all her free time alone doing embroidery when she is not doting on her father. Catherine's lack of social charm and beauty - unlike her deceased mother - is obvious to Dr. Sloper, who hopes that Lavinia will act as her guardian in becoming more of a social person, and ultimately as chaperon if Catherine were ever to meet the right man. The first man ever to show Catherine any attention is the handsome Morris Townsend, who she met at a family party. Catherine is initially uncertain as to Morris' intentions, never having been called on before by a gentleman, but she quickly falls in love with him, as he does with her. They plan to be married. Being a romantic, Lavinia does whatever she can to advance their relationship. However, Dr. Sloper does not trust Morris, believing him to be a fortune hunter who is only interested in Catherine for her sizable inheritance. His beliefs are strengthened after a candid discussion with Morris' sister, Mrs. Montgomery. Dr. Sloper does whatever he can to prevent the two from getting married - the entire reason for his disapproval which he does not fully disclose to either Catherine or Morris - including taking Catherine away for an extended European vacation. Ultimately, incidents with both her father and Morris permanently change Catherine's view of life.

By all accounts Catherine's mother was a beautiful and graceful creature with the charm of queens. Catherine never knew her mother since she died while in childbirth, but her father often reminds her of all the things her mother was and that she is not.

So, when a poor but handsome and well-bred man, Morris Townsend, begins to court Catherine, her father becomes suspicious that he must be after her money. After all, Catherine is plain and boring. What could she possibly offer to this young man - other than her money? When she refuses to give up her new beau her father threatens to disinherit her. Will her father eventually convince her to give him up and wait for a suitable husband? Will Catherine and Morris elope and live on the money left to her by her mother? Or could it be that Catherine finally finds all the grace and charm of her mother only to use it against the men in her life?

Ozzie, who is basically following his mates, may instead want to follow anthropologist Claire Huddesen, who is into prehistoric looking men like Ozzie. Unlike his two friends, Gabey purposefully wants to spend his time with a beautiful, sophisticated New York gal. He believes he's found that girl, at least her photograph, when he sees a poster for the subway system's newly crowned Miss Turnstiles for June, Ivy Smith, who he mistakenly believes is the belle of New York high society. Based on the bio on the poster, Gabey goes on a search for her. His two pals help him, but manage equally to spend quality alone time with their respective new female friends. The questions become if Gabey will be able to find Ivy, if so if she will give him the time of day, and if he would feel the same about her if he knew that she's just a working girl from small town USA trying to make it in the big city. Through it all, the six get into one misadventure after another - largely based on Hildy's long overdue cab and Ozzie causing a mishap at a museum - as they take in all New York City has to offer.

What's special about this nobody running for county treasurer? He's supposedly an honest man. Burden discovers this to be true when he sees Stark delivering a speech and having his son pass out handbills, while the local politicians do their best to intimidate him. Willie Stark is honest and brave. He's also a know-nothing hick whose schoolteacher wife has given him what little education he has.

"20","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041163/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","Battleground is one of the first World War Two films that showed the US Infantry war in Europe through the lens of reality, and one of the first to have the cast include Veterans of the very battle this story portrays. The story involves the men of 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon, Company I, 3rd Battalion, 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, which was under the Leadership of Staff Sergeant Kinne (James Whitmore).As the movie opens, on December 17, 1944, the 101st Airborne Division has returned to France for Training and R&R on November 25, 1944 after completing their share of the assault on Nijmegen-Arnhem in Holland on September 17, 1944. Two new Riflemen have arrived, fresh from a Replacement Depot, Privates Jim Layton (Marshall Thompson), and William J. Hooper (Scotty Beckett). Hooper is assigned to Company K, while Layton is assigned to Company I. Layton is further assigned to 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon, apparently expected to replace PFC Holley who is in a Field Hospital at the time, convalescing from a wound he received in Holland. Thus it is that Private Layton is introduced to his Squad, and goes through a pecking order as he figures out which cot in the Squad Tent is his, only to be out-ranked by the returning Private First Class Holley (Van Johnson) who reclaims his cot, leaving Layton as an extra man in the Squads Table of Organization. Not much is done to settle the situation at the time because the Squad which has a 3-Day Pass for Paris figures rearrangement can wait for their return, although Layton is expected to remain in camp over the three days.Staff Sergeant Kinne wakes the Squad early the next morning, informing the men that the pass is cancelled because they have to return to the frontline because of an emergency. They are told that the Germans have broken through the lines, and the 101st is needed to help plug the breach. We see 3rd Platoon boarding Deuce and a Half Trucks, and they meet their Replacement Platoon Leader, 2LT Teiss (Brett King), as they do. With the trucks loaded, 3rd Platoon pulls out and heads East, following the rest of the 101st, the troops still not knowing exactly where they are heading. The convoy ends at Bastogne, where the troops are Bivouacked at local homes for the night. 3rd Platoon draws Guard Duty, and so is at the eastern end of Bastogne when a retreating Infantry Company passes west through their lines, telling of their experience with the advancing German 47th Corps. This is when 2nd Squad learns of the seriousness of the engagement they are about to enter.The next day, the 101st continues their advancement east, deploying around Bastogne to secure their positions. This is when they experience their first action in the Battle of the Bulge, being fired upon by German machine guns that are behind cover. Once the firing stops, the Squads are deployed to clear a heavily forested area, and to set up their line, including Fox Holes and Strong Points. Just as they finish, they are moved out to another location, where they have to repeat their earlier exercise. 2nd Squad draws Guard Duty overnight, with PFC Holley, PVT Layton and PVT Kipton (Douglas Fowley) manning the eastward road block. They are told to be extra watchful for Germans in American uniforms and speaking American English. As the three men man the road block, they are approached from the east by a squad led by a 2nd Lieutenant who correctly answer the daily challenge and password. The three men let them continue on, but Van Johnson has some suspicions of the Lieutenant since he is wearing his bars while on patrol.On the next day, the snow starts, and the action starts to heat up. The Three men find out that the patrol from the previous night were indeed German infiltrators they blew a bridge and as a result the 327th sends out more patrols to scout for more German infiltrators. This time Laytons visit to K Company pay dividends because the team runs into a squad led by another 2nd Lieutenant who claims to be from K Company. Layton acts like he is not suspicious, and turns his team around towards their camp, and they try to run from the infiltrators. They run into a German machinegun team, which they destroy with a hand grenade, and then they return to their camp to report the contact. Their report results in artillery fire being dropped on the location where the German infiltrators bringing success.The Bad weather continues, with chance encounters taking place between the Germans and the Americans, adding to the casualties. Finally, the famous Nuts incident takes place, with the Germans coming to the 3rd Platoons lines. They are blind folded and taken to the Division Headquarters, where MG Mc Auliffe answers their demand for the American surrender. The Germans return via the 3rd Platoons area, and we get to see their reaction to McAuliffes answer.On Christmas Day, a Chaplain (Leon Ames) holds a service in the field, using his Jeep as the Altar. He is interrupted by incoming artillery, so he ends with silent prayer.The German Artillery Barrage continues, until when the fog lifts the Tactical Air Command can come over and knock out the German Artillery and Tanks, and the Cargo planes can drop supplies to the 101st. This leads to the lifting of the Seige, and the capturing of the surviving Germans.With the lift of the siege, the 101st Airborne Division is relived, by the 4th Armored Division, and SSG Kinne is ordered to return the 3rd Platoon to France to prepare for further action. He has them fall in and march to cadence and Jodie calls. The movie ends with them marching Westward past advancing troops.","
    
                    We follow a band of American soldiers as they engage the Germans in a snowy, foggy winter near Bastogne in World War II. They're low on fuel, rations, and ammunition; the Germans are constantly encouraging their surrender via radio and leaflets, and most importantly, the pervasive thick fog makes movement and identification difficult and prevents their relief by Allied air support. This film focuses much more on the psychology and morale of the soldiers than on action footage and heroics.

Holley and his American compatriots have already seen one of their own, Roderigues, perish under enemy fire.

                    December, 1944. The Nazis, in the face of the onrushing Allies, turned and pushed into the Ardennes Forest in Belgium and Luxembourg for what would be their last major offensive of World War II. During the Battle of the Bulge, as it is now called, they surrounded the town of Bastogne, Belgium, trapping the US Army 101st Airborne Division in the town. To make matters worse for the 101st, thick clouds covered the area for most of the battle. This prevented the Allies from providing air cover and air-dropped supplies to their troops on the ground. This film focuses on one squad of the 101st as they wait for the clouds to break.. Meanwhile, they must survive German spies in US Army uniforms, German artillery, winter weather, dwindling supplies, and the fear of being trapped by a hostile force.

    Synopsis
    Battleground is one of the first World War Two films that showed the US Infantry war in Europe through the lens of reality, and one of the first to have the cast include Veterans of the very battle this story portrays. The story involves the men of 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon, Company I, 3rd Battalion, 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, which was under the Leadership of Staff Sergeant Kinne (James Whitmore).As the movie opens, on December 17, 1944, the 101st Airborne Division has returned to France for Training and R&R on November 25, 1944 after completing their share of the assault on Nijmegen-Arnhem in Holland on September 17, 1944. Two new Riflemen have arrived, fresh from a Replacement Depot, Privates Jim Layton (Marshall Thompson), and William J. Hooper (Scotty Beckett). Hooper is assigned to Company K, while Layton is assigned to Company I. Layton is further assigned to 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon, apparently expected to replace PFC Holley who is in a Field Hospital at the time, convalescing from a wound he received in Holland. Thus it is that Private Layton is introduced to his Squad, and goes through a pecking order as he figures out which cot in the Squad Tent is his, only to be out-ranked by the returning Private First Class Holley (Van Johnson) who reclaims his cot, leaving Layton as an extra man in the Squads Table of Organization. Not much is done to settle the situation at the time because the Squad which has a 3-Day Pass for Paris figures rearrangement can wait for their return, although Layton is expected to remain in camp over the three days.Staff Sergeant Kinne wakes the Squad early the next morning, informing the men that the pass is cancelled because they have to return to the frontline because of an emergency. They are told that the Germans have broken through the lines, and the 101st is needed to help plug the breach. We see 3rd Platoon boarding Deuce and a Half Trucks, and they meet their Replacement Platoon Leader, 2LT Teiss (Brett King), as they do. With the trucks loaded, 3rd Platoon pulls out and heads East, following the rest of the 101st, the troops still not knowing exactly where they are heading. The convoy ends at Bastogne, where the troops are Bivouacked at local homes for the night. 3rd Platoon draws Guard Duty, and so is at the eastern end of Bastogne when a retreating Infantry Company passes west through their lines, telling of their experience with the advancing German 47th Corps. This is when 2nd Squad learns of the seriousness of the engagement they are about to enter.The next day, the 101st continues their advancement east, deploying around Bastogne to secure their positions. This is when they experience their first action in the Battle of the Bulge, being fired upon by German machine guns that are behind cover. Once the firing stops, the Squads are deployed to clear a heavily forested area, and to set up their line, including Fox Holes and Strong Points. Just as they finish, they are moved out to another location, where they have to repeat their earlier exercise. 2nd Squad draws Guard Duty overnight, with PFC Holley, PVT Layton and PVT Kipton (Douglas Fowley) manning the eastward road block. They are told to be extra watchful for Germans in American uniforms and speaking American English. As the three men man the road block, they are approached from the east by a squad led by a 2nd Lieutenant who correctly answer the daily challenge and password. The three men let them continue on, but Van Johnson has some suspicions of the Lieutenant since he is wearing his bars while on patrol.On the next day, the snow starts, and the action starts to heat up. The Three men find out that the patrol from the previous night were indeed German infiltrators they blew a bridge and as a result the 327th sends out more patrols to scout for more German infiltrators. This time Laytons visit to K Company pay dividends because the team runs into a squad led by another 2nd Lieutenant who claims to be from K Company. Layton acts like he is not suspicious, and turns his team around towards their camp, and they try to run from the infiltrators. They run into a German machinegun team, which they destroy with a hand grenade, and then they return to their camp to report the contact. Their report results in artillery fire being dropped on the location where the German infiltrators bringing success.The Bad weather continues, with chance encounters taking place between the Germans and the Americans, adding to the casualties. Finally, the famous Nuts incident takes place, with the Germans coming to the 3rd Platoons lines. They are blind folded and taken to the Division Headquarters, where MG Mc Auliffe answers their demand for the American surrender. The Germans return via the 3rd Platoons area, and we get to see their reaction to McAuliffes answer.On Christmas Day, a Chaplain (Leon Ames) holds a service in the field, using his Jeep as the Altar. He is interrupted by incoming artillery, so he ends with silent prayer.The German Artillery Barrage continues, until when the fog lifts the Tactical Air Command can come over and knock out the German Artillery and Tanks, and the Cargo planes can drop supplies to the 101st. This leads to the lifting of the Seige, and the capturing of the surviving Germans.With the lift of the siege, the 101st Airborne Division is relived, by the 4th Armored Division, and SSG Kinne is ordered to return the 3rd Platoon to France to prepare for further action. He has them fall in and march to cadence and Jodie calls. The movie ends with them marching Westward past advancing troops.

Oddly, the police almost seem to have been expecting him and already know who he is since there has been an APB on him since yesterday.A flashback begins two days earlier with Bigelow in his hometown of Banning, California where he is an accountant and notary public. He decides to take a one-week vacation in San Francisco, but this does not sit well with Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton), his confidential secretary and girlfriend, as he does not want her to accompany him.Bigelow arrives at his hotel, Paula telephones to tell him that Eugene Philips, of Philips' Import and Exporting Company, urgently needs to speak with him and refuses to leave a message. That evening Sam Haskell, a guest in the room opposite Bigelow's, invites him to a party in his suite. Bigelow accompanies Haskell and his friends, a group of randy men from a sales convention on a night on the town.At a ""jive"" nightclub called ""The Fisherman"", unnoticed by Bigelow, a stranger swaps his drink for another. (The nightclub scene includes one of the earliest depictions of the Beat sub-culture). The next morning, Bigelow feels ill. He visits a doctor at the general hospital, where tests reveal he swallowed a poison called ""luminous toxin"" for which there is no antidote. A second opinion confirms the grim diagnosis, and the other doctor implies that the poisoning must have been deliberate. Bigelow remembers his drink tasted strange. He flees from the hospital in a panic, wondering who poisoned him and why.With just a day or two to live at most, Bigelow sets out to untangle the events behind his impending death. He first returns to the Embarcadero bar, which is closed, then looks for Haskell, who has already checked out of the hotel. During a phone call with Paula, she inadvertently provides the first clue: a man named Eugene Philips who had urgently been trying to contact Bigelow by phone for the past two days has suddenly died, purportedly a suicide. Driven by an impulse, Bigelow travels to Philips' import-export company in Los Angeles, meeting a variety of suspicious characters. He first meets Miss Foster (Beverly Garland), Philips' secretary; then Mr. Halliday (William Ching), the company's comptroller, who tells him that Eugene Philips committed suicide after jumping out of a window from his high-rise apartment the previous day, but he cannot offer Bigelow any information on why Philips was attempting to contact him or why. From there, Bigelow follows a lead to Philips' widow (Lynn Baggett) (whom is strangely distraught to meet Bigelow despite the fact that they have never met before). Bigelow also meets Philips' younger brother Stanley (Henry Hart) whom also claims not to know what Philips was wanting to speak with Bigelow for. However, Stanley does explain that his brother had sold a rare form of iridium, a luminous toxin, and faced possible imprisonment, which drove him to suicide.Back at the hotel, Paula again telephones Bigelow to say she has discovered that some months prior, Bigelow notarized a bill of sale of iridium from a man named George Reynolds who was working in league with Philips. Returning to question Mrs. Philips, Bigelow discovers that both the bill of sale and Reynolds have disappeared. Believing that all evidence of the sale is being systematically eliminated, Bigelow thinks he has the motive for his poisoning and is determined to find the culprit. Convinced that Philips was also murdered, Bigelow again questions Miss Foster, who reveals that on the day of his death Philips saw Marla Rakubian (Laurette Luez), a model and former girl friend.Bigelow goes to see Marla and accuses her of being in league with Reynolds. When she pulls a gun on him, he disarms her and then takes both the gun and a portrait picture she has of Reynolds. Bigelow tries to locate Reynolds through the portrait studio, but instead discovers Reynolds' real name is Raymond Rakubian. When he goes to see Reynolds at the address provided by the photographers, Frank finds an abandoned warehouse and is fired upon by an unseen sniper from a warehouse. Bigelow chases the sniper, who gets away.That evening, after returning to Philips' office, Bigelow is kidnapped by Chester (Nevile Brand), a psychotic henchman of Reynolds' gangster uncle, Mr. Majak, the illegal purchaser of the iridium. He is taken to Majak himself, where his current mistress, Marla, is beside him. Majak insists that his nephew cannot be connected to the murders as he has been dead for the past five months.However, Bigelow manages to escape when he stops the car that Chester is driving through the city and runs out. Chester pulls out a gun and gives chase, attempting to shoot Bigelow on the busy sidewalk. Bigelow runs into a pinball arcade where the police show up and shoot Chester dead, allowing Bigelow to slip away.Bigelow thinks Stanley and Miss Foster are his killers but when he confronts them at Philips' office, he finds Stanley has been poisoned too - after having dinner with Mrs. Philips. He tells them to call an ambulance and what poison has been ingested so that (in Stanley's case at least) prompt treatment may save his life. Stanley tells Bigelow he found evidence that Halliday and Mrs. Philips were having an affair. Bigelow realizes that the theft of the iridium by Majak was merely a diversion. Philips discovered the affair and Halliday killed him.Bigelow then confronts Mrs. Philips at her house where she tells him that she and Halliday used the investigation of the iridium as a cover for their crime, making it seem that Eugene Philips had killed himself out of shame. However, when they discovered that there was evidence of his innocence in the notarized bill of sale, Halliday murdered anyone who had knowledge of the bill of sale.After leaving Mrs. Philips apartment building, Bigelow is jumped by several of Majak's henchmen who try to kill him. Bigelow manages to outrun them and boards a local bus, but the gangsters, led by Majak himself, follow the bus in a car. When the bus stops at a local stop, one of the henchmen attempts to board, but Bigelow disembarks and sees a policeman standing at the street corner and stands close to him. Seeing that Majak and his henchmen will not attempt to capture or kill Bigelow with the cop standing close by, they drive away, allowing Bigelow to escape again.Bigelow tracks Halliday down to an office where he confronts him and finally sees that Halliday was the stranger who poisoned his drink the previous night.

                    The elegant, accomplished Addie Ross has left town for good. Her parting gesture, delivered to her three ""best"" friends as they left for a day trip, was a letter informing the women that she had absconded with one of their husbands --- which husband, she doesn't say. So each of the three wives spends the day reminissing about the ups and (mostly) downs of her marriage -- wondering if hers is the husband who has flown the coop.

The council believes it to be both an eyesore and a health hazard, and they plan on condemning it. The mayor thinks it's a win-win situation for both the town and the Kettles when he learns that Pa has just won a completely furnished modern house in the King Henry Tobacco Company's slogan contest. Beyond getting the Kettles out of their current rat trap, Pa's contest win has put Cape Flattery ""on the map"". The Kettles, especially Pa who entered the contest solely to get a new tobacco pouch, may not see this situation as being a win as they try to adapt to their new house and all its newfangled gadgets. Local busybody Birdie Hicks also doesn't see it as a win as she, who never liked Pa, is jealous of all the attention the Kettles are receiving. She'll do whatever she can to ruin the Kettle's new life. The contest win also brings to town the Kettle's oldest son, Tom, who just graduated from college in animal husbandry, and reporter Kim Parker, who is doing a story on the Kettles. Tom is initially worried that Kim's story will make the Kettles a national laughing stock, but in the end, Tom and Kim fall for each other. Kim does whatever she can to help the Kettles.

"29","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042004/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","It is 1831. British King William IV has appointed a new governor (Cecil Parker) for New South Wales in Australia. In full dress military redcoat and cocked hat at an arrival ceremony, he gives a brief speech that is marred by disrespectful comments from some rowdies in the crowd.A younger cousin of the governor, Charles Adare (Michael Wilding) has traveled with him from Ireland. Even before the end of the speech, Charles is approached by a local banker who offers his services. Charles admits he doesn't have a penny, yet hopes to make his fortune in Sydney. The banker says he can help anyway, so Charles agrees to meet him the next day.During the next day's appointment, a powerful local landowner named Sam Flusky (Joseph Cotton) enters the bank and the banker points him out to Charles as an example of what fortunes might be made in Australia even with a convict background. Charles asks to be introduced, as he seems to recall the last name. The banker warns him that in Australia it is not acceptable manners to ask about a person's past or convict status. Upon introduction, Flusky recognizes the name Adare, and almost immediately proposes a business deal requiring no capital when he learns that Charles is a cousin of the Governor. Flusky offers Charles a temporary loan to acquire a certain land parcel that Flusky wants but cannot purchase directly because of legal limits on land grant applications, and Charles agrees to help with the promise of a huge quick profit.Charles later tells his uncle about the plan. But when the uncle wants to know about Flusky, Attorney General Corrigan (Denis O'Dea) strongly discourages any deals, saying that Flusky is now acting within the law but is a very unsavory character with a criminal past. The Governor then orders Charles to avoid Flusky.Since he wants the easy money, Charles disobeys the uncle and accepts an invitation to dine at Flusky's home. He comes to dinner at Flusky's large and elegant home in a carriage. The driver comments on Flusky's low social prestige despite his wealth and translates a motto displayed at the entrance: ""Minyago Yugilla?"" means ""Why Weepest Thou?"" Charles walks around the house before ringing the entrance bell, overhears and witnesses things that tell him that Flusky is using him to climb in social standing because he is the Governor's relative, and also that Milly the housekeeper (Margaret Leighton) is a willful tyrant who keeps the kitchen staff under control with a whip.As other guests arrive, including Attorney General Corrigan, they are all male, as all wives invited give an excuse not to attend. And, as reported by Milly, Sam's wife is not well, and also will not attend.Halfway through the meal, Sam's wife (Ingrid Bergman) comes down the stairs in bare feet and dressed in something that is more like a nightgown than a dinner dress. She welcomes the gentlemen, and walks unsteadily to sit at the head of the table.Charles recognizes Mrs. Flusky as Lady Henrietta, an aristocratic neighbor he remembers as a child growing up in Ireland. ""Hattie"" was a friend of Charles's sister. He sits next to Hattie, she recognizes him, and is happy to recall events of their past. But it appears Hattie is an alcoholic and on the verge of madness.After a short while Hattie decides to go upstairs to her room, but on arriving there, she utters a terrified scream calling for Charles. Charles rushes up and finds Hattie trembling outside the door and talking about the horrible thing on the bed. Charles enters the bedroom, finds nothing, yet shoots into the fireplace and comes out comforting Hattie and saying nothing can hurt her any more.Af the guests leave, Sam expresses his displeasure at the guests' wives who snubbed his invitation, and his gratitude to Charles because he saw that Hattie had been genuinely pleased and interested to have seen him. Sam encourages Charles to come again hopes that the younger man's friendship will be able to cheer up his wife. In Sam's view, Hattie's condition is the result of isolation and of being snubbed by the social establishment, and the fact that they became different people in a different environment after the years of his imprisonment. They're now an unhappy couple who are shunned by established society. Charles agrees to try to help her regain a sense of stability.Meantime, Milly is seen giving alcohol to Hattie and spying suspiciously on Charles.Charles recalls the details of the scandal back in Ireland: Lady Henrietta, of the landed gentry and Sam Flusky, a groom on her estate eloped to England. They were pursued by her brother, and when they were found, Flusky shot him dead. As the brother was armed and had also fired a shot, Flusky was not hung but taken to Australia.Lady Henrietta followed him to Australia and waited for his seven year term to end. When Sam was released they found they had much changed during those years, and the marriage was not happy. Sam concentrated on becoming rich and being able to afford material goods for Hattie, but it wasn't enough, Hattie started to drink and lost interest in everything. In the following years, the relationship with Sam had not recovered, and had been made worse by Henrietta's increasing alcoholism.Meantime the household is run by Milly. who keeps it functioning, and keeps Lady Henrietta under control.Charles insists on completing the land deal with Flusky. This angers his cousin the governor, who expels him. As Charles has as yet no money, he turns to Sam, who invites him to move in and try to cheer up and rehabilitate Hattie, getting her to become interested in horseback riding, in clothes, and life itself. He moves in, and slowly revives the self-reliant woman that Hattie was once.One of his first successes is to convince Hattie to look at her own reflection, as in a mirror, for the first time in years. But Charles' efforts to rehabilitate Hattie conflict with Milly's aspirations of control. Milly keeps throwing up various snags to upset the recovery. Charles begins to notice this, but not Sam.At one point, Hattie becomes confident enough to try to run her own household and kitchen without Milly. However, Milly has undermined Hattie's authority with the kitchen staff. The kitchen help, used to Milly's control, disobeys, and Hattie realizes that she has no say in her own house. She locks herself in her bedroom and refuses to come out. Charles, encouraged by Sam, enters her bedroom through a balcony and convinces Hattie not to give up. When Milly is called to the bedroom to help the mistress undress for bed, she knocks and because the door is locked and Charles is there she accuses them to be in a physical relationship, despite the fact that Sam had been standing below outside and probably was aware of everything that went on in that room.In desperation, Milly arranges to expose Hattie's hidden collection of empty wine bottles from the bedroom to humiliate her in front of the servants. This last trick backfires, Milly threatens to resign and leave, and, to her surprise, she is ousted from the house. Once Milly is ousted, Hattie takes real control of the kitchen, and her recovery proceeds ever faster.One day, Charles brings in an invitation to the Governors ball, addressed to Sam and Hattie. A dress is ordered, Hattie dresses up beautifully, but at the last minute Sam refuses to go and insists that Charles escort Hattie in his place. He is feeling rejected because he bought a spectacular ruby necklace that he intends to give to Hattie, but before he gives it, Hattie and Charles comment that ruby color isn't the best match for the coloring of the dress she is wearing.At the ball, Hattie is stunning and catches the Governor's eye. Before he realizes who she is, he shows her great deference and admiration. Meantime, the reception staff has identified her invitation as a forgery. But the governor insists that she stay, including Charles, whom he had ordered expelled from the ball shortly before.Right after Hattie and Charles leave for the ball, Milly, approaches Sam at his home, and asks to be taken back. It is clear that she is in love with Sam and wants to replace Hattie. Sam listens to her long plea in a speech that insinuates in all conceivable ways that Hattie is either having an affair with Charles or in any case is humiliating Sam by appearing in public with Charles instead of her husband or failing that, that everyone will think they are in love and thus humiliate Sam even more and the results could be socially disastrous. She also works in that Charles and Hattie are of a different social class from Sam, that they have views and conventions that allow them to do things that would be considered shameful for ordinary, non-aristocratic people.At first Sam does not react, since, after all, Charles is substantially younger than Hattie, and anyway his demeanor throughout has been that of a male who is not interested in women, much too interested in clothing, and always impeccably dressed. But Milly eventually manages to make Sam enraged about the situation.Sam goes to the ball, makes a scene, humiliates Hattie, who returns home upset and weeping.Charles follows Hattie home and attempts to calm her. Hattie tearfully confesses to Charles how she deeply loves and is honor bound to Sam, because it was she who shot her own brother, not Sam, and Sam took the blame to save her from prison.Sam returns to the house, demands that Charles leave for good. Charles takes a horse but regretfully the horse stumbles and breaks a leg, forcing him to return. Sam gets a gun, kills the horse, and as he re-enters the house, in a combination of anger and accident, Charles is shot.Sam is immediately incarcerated, as his convict past demands immediate jail for any violent offense.Hattie, in an attempt to save Sam, confesses to having shot her brother, the crime that led to Sam's original conviction. But such a confession brings complications, in that Sam would be freed only if Hattie were sent back for trial. They are in a real dilemma: If Sam corroborates Hattie's confession, he goes free and she goes to jail. If he does not corroborate her confession, he goes to prison for good. The Attorney General is not being helpful, since the governor wants to jail somebody for having shot his cousin.

    Synopsis
    It is 1831. British King William IV has appointed a new governor (Cecil Parker) for New South Wales in Australia. In full dress military redcoat and cocked hat at an arrival ceremony, he gives a brief speech that is marred by disrespectful comments from some rowdies in the crowd.A younger cousin of the governor, Charles Adare (Michael Wilding) has traveled with him from Ireland. Even before the end of the speech, Charles is approached by a local banker who offers his services. Charles admits he doesn't have a penny, yet hopes to make his fortune in Sydney. The banker says he can help anyway, so Charles agrees to meet him the next day.During the next day's appointment, a powerful local landowner named Sam Flusky (Joseph Cotton) enters the bank and the banker points him out to Charles as an example of what fortunes might be made in Australia even with a convict background. Charles asks to be introduced, as he seems to recall the last name. The banker warns him that in Australia it is not acceptable manners to ask about a person's past or convict status. Upon introduction, Flusky recognizes the name Adare, and almost immediately proposes a business deal requiring no capital when he learns that Charles is a cousin of the Governor. Flusky offers Charles a temporary loan to acquire a certain land parcel that Flusky wants but cannot purchase directly because of legal limits on land grant applications, and Charles agrees to help with the promise of a huge quick profit.Charles later tells his uncle about the plan. But when the uncle wants to know about Flusky, Attorney General Corrigan (Denis O'Dea) strongly discourages any deals, saying that Flusky is now acting within the law but is a very unsavory character with a criminal past. The Governor then orders Charles to avoid Flusky.Since he wants the easy money, Charles disobeys the uncle and accepts an invitation to dine at Flusky's home. He comes to dinner at Flusky's large and elegant home in a carriage. The driver comments on Flusky's low social prestige despite his wealth and translates a motto displayed at the entrance: ""Minyago Yugilla?"" means ""Why Weepest Thou?"" Charles walks around the house before ringing the entrance bell, overhears and witnesses things that tell him that Flusky is using him to climb in social standing because he is the Governor's relative, and also that Milly the housekeeper (Margaret Leighton) is a willful tyrant who keeps the kitchen staff under control with a whip.As other guests arrive, including Attorney General Corrigan, they are all male, as all wives invited give an excuse not to attend. And, as reported by Milly, Sam's wife is not well, and also will not attend.Halfway through the meal, Sam's wife (Ingrid Bergman) comes down the stairs in bare feet and dressed in something that is more like a nightgown than a dinner dress. She welcomes the gentlemen, and walks unsteadily to sit at the head of the table.Charles recognizes Mrs. Flusky as Lady Henrietta, an aristocratic neighbor he remembers as a child growing up in Ireland. ""Hattie"" was a friend of Charles's sister. He sits next to Hattie, she recognizes him, and is happy to recall events of their past. But it appears Hattie is an alcoholic and on the verge of madness.After a short while Hattie decides to go upstairs to her room, but on arriving there, she utters a terrified scream calling for Charles. Charles rushes up and finds Hattie trembling outside the door and talking about the horrible thing on the bed. Charles enters the bedroom, finds nothing, yet shoots into the fireplace and comes out comforting Hattie and saying nothing can hurt her any more.Af the guests leave, Sam expresses his displeasure at the guests' wives who snubbed his invitation, and his gratitude to Charles because he saw that Hattie had been genuinely pleased and interested to have seen him. Sam encourages Charles to come again hopes that the younger man's friendship will be able to cheer up his wife. In Sam's view, Hattie's condition is the result of isolation and of being snubbed by the social establishment, and the fact that they became different people in a different environment after the years of his imprisonment. They're now an unhappy couple who are shunned by established society. Charles agrees to try to help her regain a sense of stability.Meantime, Milly is seen giving alcohol to Hattie and spying suspiciously on Charles.Charles recalls the details of the scandal back in Ireland: Lady Henrietta, of the landed gentry and Sam Flusky, a groom on her estate eloped to England. They were pursued by her brother, and when they were found, Flusky shot him dead. As the brother was armed and had also fired a shot, Flusky was not hung but taken to Australia.Lady Henrietta followed him to Australia and waited for his seven year term to end. When Sam was released they found they had much changed during those years, and the marriage was not happy. Sam concentrated on becoming rich and being able to afford material goods for Hattie, but it wasn't enough, Hattie started to drink and lost interest in everything. In the following years, the relationship with Sam had not recovered, and had been made worse by Henrietta's increasing alcoholism.Meantime the household is run by Milly. who keeps it functioning, and keeps Lady Henrietta under control.Charles insists on completing the land deal with Flusky. This angers his cousin the governor, who expels him. As Charles has as yet no money, he turns to Sam, who invites him to move in and try to cheer up and rehabilitate Hattie, getting her to become interested in horseback riding, in clothes, and life itself. He moves in, and slowly revives the self-reliant woman that Hattie was once.One of his first successes is to convince Hattie to look at her own reflection, as in a mirror, for the first time in years. But Charles' efforts to rehabilitate Hattie conflict with Milly's aspirations of control. Milly keeps throwing up various snags to upset the recovery. Charles begins to notice this, but not Sam.At one point, Hattie becomes confident enough to try to run her own household and kitchen without Milly. However, Milly has undermined Hattie's authority with the kitchen staff. The kitchen help, used to Milly's control, disobeys, and Hattie realizes that she has no say in her own house. She locks herself in her bedroom and refuses to come out. Charles, encouraged by Sam, enters her bedroom through a balcony and convinces Hattie not to give up. When Milly is called to the bedroom to help the mistress undress for bed, she knocks and because the door is locked and Charles is there she accuses them to be in a physical relationship, despite the fact that Sam had been standing below outside and probably was aware of everything that went on in that room.In desperation, Milly arranges to expose Hattie's hidden collection of empty wine bottles from the bedroom to humiliate her in front of the servants. This last trick backfires, Milly threatens to resign and leave, and, to her surprise, she is ousted from the house. Once Milly is ousted, Hattie takes real control of the kitchen, and her recovery proceeds ever faster.One day, Charles brings in an invitation to the Governors ball, addressed to Sam and Hattie. A dress is ordered, Hattie dresses up beautifully, but at the last minute Sam refuses to go and insists that Charles escort Hattie in his place. He is feeling rejected because he bought a spectacular ruby necklace that he intends to give to Hattie, but before he gives it, Hattie and Charles comment that ruby color isn't the best match for the coloring of the dress she is wearing.At the ball, Hattie is stunning and catches the Governor's eye. Before he realizes who she is, he shows her great deference and admiration. Meantime, the reception staff has identified her invitation as a forgery. But the governor insists that she stay, including Charles, whom he had ordered expelled from the ball shortly before.Right after Hattie and Charles leave for the ball, Milly, approaches Sam at his home, and asks to be taken back. It is clear that she is in love with Sam and wants to replace Hattie. Sam listens to her long plea in a speech that insinuates in all conceivable ways that Hattie is either having an affair with Charles or in any case is humiliating Sam by appearing in public with Charles instead of her husband or failing that, that everyone will think they are in love and thus humiliate Sam even more and the results could be socially disastrous. She also works in that Charles and Hattie are of a different social class from Sam, that they have views and conventions that allow them to do things that would be considered shameful for ordinary, non-aristocratic people.At first Sam does not react, since, after all, Charles is substantially younger than Hattie, and anyway his demeanor throughout has been that of a male who is not interested in women, much too interested in clothing, and always impeccably dressed. But Milly eventually manages to make Sam enraged about the situation.Sam goes to the ball, makes a scene, humiliates Hattie, who returns home upset and weeping.Charles follows Hattie home and attempts to calm her. Hattie tearfully confesses to Charles how she deeply loves and is honor bound to Sam, because it was she who shot her own brother, not Sam, and Sam took the blame to save her from prison.Sam returns to the house, demands that Charles leave for good. Charles takes a horse but regretfully the horse stumbles and breaks a leg, forcing him to return. Sam gets a gun, kills the horse, and as he re-enters the house, in a combination of anger and accident, Charles is shot.Sam is immediately incarcerated, as his convict past demands immediate jail for any violent offense.Hattie, in an attempt to save Sam, confesses to having shot her brother, the crime that led to Sam's original conviction. But such a confession brings complications, in that Sam would be freed only if Hattie were sent back for trial. They are in a real dilemma: If Sam corroborates Hattie's confession, he goes free and she goes to jail. If he does not corroborate her confession, he goes to prison for good. The Attorney General is not being helpful, since the governor wants to jail somebody for having shot his cousin. Corrigan gives Sam 24 hours to make up his mind about what his story is.Meantime, Milly, seeing her chances to get Sam slipping away, attempts to poison Hattie. She is discovered in her plot, found to have planted a shrunken head at the bed to frighten Hattie from time to time, and ousted.Meantime Charles has recovered from the wound, and, at the critical moment, reappears to vouch that he was shot in a true accident and not in a violent act by Sam.Charles is put back on a ship to return to Ireland and is waved goodbye by the now happy Sam and Hattie.

"30","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041968/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","The film starts by showing us a man (Robert Neff) sitting in a large car parked off to the side of the road, engine still running, though. We're shown the mile marker (3.5) he's parked at; the man looks at his watch. It is precisely 8:30. He's obviously waiting for someone.Then we see a car approaching up a winding road. It contains Jane and Alan Palmer (Lizabeth Scott and Arthur Kennedy) on their way to a party in the Hollywood Hills, hosted by Alan's boss and his wife. Jane Palmer begs her husband Alan, who is driving the couple's convertible, to turn the car around. When she explains that she cannot face the party's hostess and her condescending ways, Alan turns the car around only after he and Jane argue. In the course of the argument, Jane reached for the ignition keys. Instead, she hit the headlight switch, turning off the headlights, which Alan then turned back on. We see the man in the waiting car drive it unto the highway toward Jane and Alan's convertible.As Jane and Alan's convertible passes the oncoming car, the driver tosses a large satchel into the back seat of their car. The driver had interpreted their blinking headlights as his signal. After stopping briefly to examine the suitcase and discovering that it contains bundles of money, Jane and Alan see another car approaching theirs at a fast speed. Jane urges Alan to get into the car and then, behind the wheel herself, she drives on. A chase ensues, with the car pursuing Jane and Alan until, after a dangerous drive, Jane finally is able to give the pursuer the slip. Obviously, the car pursuing Jane and Alan's vehicle is the one into which the satchel should have been thrown. And it is possible that the driver of that car now has the license plate number of Jane and Alan's car and will be able to trace them.Back in downtown L.A., Jane and Alan are stopped by a police officer who writes Alan a ticket for making a turn without signaling. The police officer notices the two are nervous. Jane tells him she and Alan are eloping to Las Vegas.When Jane and Alan get back to their apartment in Chateau Michele, Alan wants to turn over the money to the police and be done with it. Jane sweet talks him into delaying that.Alan's sister Kathy Palmer (Kristine Miller), who has Apartment 515 across the hall, comes into their apartment, even though it is late. Alan pleads a headache and Kathy leaves, but this scene serves to introduce Kathy, her close relationship to Alan, and her dislike of Jane.After Kathy goes, Jane and Alan agree to check the bag at Union Station for a week. Alan and Jane go to Union Station and check the satchel, for which he receives a claim ticket. To draw viewers' attention to the checkroom claim ticket, Alan at first appears to have lost it, until he reveals that it's fallen through a hole in his overcoat pocket and into the lining of the coat. He retrieves it. Alan later places this ticket in the drawer of a chest of drawers in the bedroom under his service revolver, though Jane doesn't know he's put the ticket there.The next day Jane goes on a shopping spree, purchasing $780.00 worth of clothing, among which is a fur jacket. Alan learns of this when his bank calls to tell him that Jane has written checks for large amounts. When Alan comes home, he and Jane argue again because Alan wants to turn the money over to the police. Alan brings up Jane's first husband, a man named Blanchert, whom she married for his money. Jane tells Alan that growing up she was white-collar poor, that she lived among middle-class people but her family never had enough to keep up. This explains Jane's attitude toward money. To appease Alan, Jane agrees to his plan to duplicate the events of their first date.Earlier that day after Jane returned from shopping and before Alan came home, small time hood Danny Fuller (Dan Duryea), posing as a detective, arrives at the Palmers' apartment (having traced their car's license number) and asks to search the place, even though he doesn't have a warrant. When Jane allows the search, Danny knows she has the money, otherwise, as Danny says, she would have screamed for the police and tried to throw him out. Danny demands that Jane give him the suitcase. Jane lies, telling Danny that they have already turned it over to the police; Danny leaves but threatens to return if news of a suitcase full of money being turned over to the police does not appear in the afternoon's newspapers.To duplicate their first date, Alan and Jane make plans for dinner and a boat ride at a nearby lake the next night. Before Jane and Alan ""date,"" while Alan is out, Danny returns, knowing now that Jane lied, but Jane persuades him to split the money with her. She tells Danny she can take him to the money. She still hasn't revealed to Danny that it's in the satchel at the Union Station checkroom.Of course, Jane has to get the money, and to get that, she must locate the claim ticket. Jane tells Danny to meet her later that night at a palm tree at the west end shore of the lake where she and Alan are going for a boat ride. When Jane goes to meet Alan for dinner, she takes his gun from the dresser drawer because she is planning to kill Alan and dump his body in the lake.After dinner, Alan and Jane take a motorized boat onto the lake. But Jane loses her nerve; she asks Alan to go back to shore, but Alan says no, they've just come out unto the lake. Alan wants a cigarette and is about to open Jane's purse, when she strikes his hand, stopping him. Alan asks her what's in the purse; it's so heavy. And at that point, the gun falls out of the purse. The two grapple for the gun, and it goes off, killing Alan.With Alan's dead body in the boat, Jane then steers the boat toward the palm tree and picks up Danny, who is stunned to discover Alan's corpse in the boat. He's going to back out; he wants no part of murder. But, seeing he hasn't any choice, Danny helps her dump Alan's corpse overboard, after first securing the corpse so it won't rise to the top.Before putting Alan's body into the pond, Jane took off his overcoat and his hat, and Danny put them on. When the boat pulls up to the dock, Danny gets out, keeping his face and body turned away from the boat rental agent (Billy Halop), while Jane pays. He hurries off, and Jane rushes to catch up with him.Together Jane and Danny drive back to Jane's apartment house where Danny drives the car into the basement garage, according to their plan to convince Pete (Smoki Whitfield), the black garage attendant, that Alan is still alive. Once the car is in the garage, Jane gets out, and Danny drives the car out of the garage, but not before Jane calls Pete's attention to herself and ""Alan."" She tells Pete ""Alan"" wants the car washed when he brings it back. As ""Alan"" drives out of the garage, Jane shouts after him, telling him to purchase some cigarettes for her at the drug store. Thus, it appears that ""Alan"" is going on an errand of some sort and will get the cigarettes on the way.Once upstairs, Jane knocks on Kathy's door and asks her to come over for a nightcap. Jane tells Cathy that Alan has gone out to get a bottle and some cigarettes, and Kathy says she will stay for a drink. When Alan doesn't come home after several hours, Jane acts worried and eventually phones the police to report Alan as a missing person. In the course of this time, the nervous Jane asks Kathy to fix them both a drink, whereupon Kathy discovers that there is plenty of liquor under the kitchen sink. So why is Alan going out for a bottle? Further, Jane tells Kathy she's sure that Alan doesn't love her anymore, that he's involved with another woman, which Kathy dismisses as nonsense, though this does arouse her suspicions further. Why is Jane telling her this?After Kathy leaves, Jane leaves to keep an appointment with Danny. She still believes he has the claim check in the lining of Alan's overcoat. At the motel unit where Danny is renting a room, they inspect that lining of the coat and Danny brings out the claim check--only it isn't the claim check. It's a blank piece of paper. Alan, suspecting Jane would try to claim the money behind his back, had replaced the claim check with this blank and put the original claim check in his dresser under his revolver.Jane now comes clean and explains to Danny where the money really is and how they must find the actual claim check ticket in order to get the money. In the motel room, Danny tries to kiss Jane, saying he wants to know Jane better. She momentarily resists him but then embraces him, kisses him, and the scene fades out. I deduce the two have sex. The fade-out used here was common in films of the 40s to indicate a sexual scene. Also, from their very first meeting, Jane had been trying to lure Danny into sex, which, at that time, Danny wasn't interested in.The next morning, still worried about Alan, Kathy uses her passkey to enter Jane and Alan's apartment. She searches through various items of furniture, coming at last to the chest of drawers in the bedroom. There she discovers that Alan's revolver is missing. And underneath the cloth upon which the revolver rest, Kathy discovers the claim check for the satchel, which she takes--steals. Jane, of course, is unaware the claim check was there.The next morning when Kathy asks about Alan and learns he's still missing, Kathy suggests they look for Alan's revolver. It was one of his favorite things. If Alan were planning to run away, surely he'd have taken it. But they find it in the dresser drawer, where Jane put it when she returned home the previous evening.The police cannot act upon Jane's report of Alan as missing. Alan hasn't been gone long enough and, besides, there's no evidence of a crime or foul play. Nonetheless, Jane continues to play the role of distraught spouse, worried over a missing husband.It's apparent that Jane and Kathy don't like each other, and Kathy begins to be suspicious of Jane. She's also aware that Danny (whom she doesn't know by name) has come to Jane's apartment.Just as Kathy leaves Jane's apartment, she opens the door to find a man standing there, about to knock. This man identifies himself as Don Blake (Don DeFore), who says he's Alan's friend and a fellow war veteran. Don says Alan told him to drop by if he were ever in L.A. Don is in L. A. for a vacation and decided to look up Alan. Kathy takes him into her own apartment and explains that Alan has just recently gone missing. She tells Blake of her suspicions about Jane. This makes Kathy and Don Blake a team investigating Alan's disappearance. At the film's denouement, we learn why Don is only too willing to believe the worst of Jane.Later, Kathy introduces Jane to Blake. Jane asks Blake some questions about his war service with Alan and is immediately suspicious when Blake gives her erroneous answers. After Blake and Kathy depart, Danny arrives.Jane tells Danny that she has the money, and they will go to get it. In reality, she is planning to drive Danny into the Hollywood Hills and shoot him to death with Alan's gun. Jane drives recklessly, and Danny becomes increasingly suspicious and unnerved. After Jane narrowly avoids a collision, Danny demands that she stop. He tells her she's lying when she says the money's buried in the hills, and he gets out of the car and walks away. As he disappears, Jane cries to herself, ""The claim ticket is in that coat,"" because she thinks the claim ticket is still in the lining of Alan's coat, which Danny is wearing. She must now get that coat back from Danny. Jane drives to the beach and abandons her car. Two vagrants (Richard Irving and Jimmie Dodd) steal it and drive away in it. They abandon the car near the Mexican border.Jane visits Danny at his place to reclaim the coat. This arouses Danny's suspicions, and he begins to search the coat. In the lining he finds--what?--NOT the claim ticket but a blank bit of paper about the size of the claim check ticket. Alan, again not trusting Jane, had substituted the blank for the real ticket. Jane now comes clean and explains to Danny where the money really is and how they must find the actual claim check ticket in order to get the money. Jane and Danny have sex as her way of luring him on to trust her.When Jane returns to her apartment, a Lt. Breach (Barry Kelley) shows up, saying he's investigating Alan's disappearance. Kathy is also there. Lt. Breach tells Jane, ""There's another woman"" and details the near accident that occurred when Jane was driving Danny into the Hollywood Hills a night earlier. The driver of the car Jane almost hit obtained the license number of her car, thus Breach says it was Alan and Jane's car. Lt. Breach says the other woman (in fact Jane herself) was driving and Alan (Danny dressed in Alan's coat and hat) was the passenger. Instead of acting surprised and stunned at this news, Jane says she knew there was another woman and gives a bit of description of this woman, saying she'd only seen her from a distance. Kathy who's listening to all of this, is confused and suspicious; Alan just couldn't be committing adultery; not her brother!Suspicious of Don and his story of being Alan's war buddy, Jane phoned Jack Sharber (David Clarke), a friend of Alan's with whom she is acquainted. When Sharber tells her that he does not recognize Blake's name as belonging to a member of their war unit, she invites Sharber to the apartment the following night to meet Don Blake.Later, Jane and Danny meet again. Jane explains that Kathy has become too suspicious of her and feels that Kathy will discover their plot. Jane asks Danny to buy her some poison so that she can kill Kathy, making it appear a suicide, i.e., Kathy and Alan were close; Kathy was despondent over Alan's disappearance; therefore, Kathy commits suicide. Danny agrees to do this, though he doesn't like it but says he's too far in to back out now.Knowing Jane is out of her apartment, Kathy, using a key she has to Alan and Jane's apartment, enters the apartment. She begins a search of the apartment and discovers that Alan's revolver is missing. She also notices the claim check ticket, which was under the cloth in the drawer where the gun had been kept. Jane is obviously unaware of this or she wouldn't be searching for the ticket in the coat lining. Without a qualm, Kathy takes the ticket! This was stupid thing to do. Certainly, had Jane known of the ticket, she would immediately notice the missing ticket and deduce that Kathy has been in the apartment.Later, Blake arrives to pick up Kathy for a date, and she gives him the claim check ticket. They agree to stop at Union Station before going to dinner and present the claim check ticket to see what is there. But as they leave Kathy's apartment, Jane demands that they come over to her apartment, where Sharber is waiting. When Sharber says that he does not recognize Blake, Blake realizes that his phony story of being Alan's war buddy is unfolding as a lie. When Sarber goes, Jane, in a take-no-prisoners situation, pulls her gun and demands that Don give her the claim ticket. Kathy, now suspicious of Blake herself, because he lied about being Alan's buddy, runs into her apartment to phone the police, hoping they will arrive to straighten everything out. When Kathy returns to Jane's apartment, she finds Don unconscious on the floor and Jane gone. Kathy once again phones the police and tells them to go to Union Station. Now that she has the claim check ticket, Jane has gone to collect the satchel herself.At Union Station, Jane decides not to collect the suitcase herself. Instead, she gives a come-on to a lonely guy (Denver Pyle) near the newsstand and asks him to reclaim the bag for her in return for $5. She also promises him that, if he wishes, he can later spend that $5 on her. Thinking he's unto a potential one-night stand, the guy gets the suitcase. But when he reads the tag on the satchel's handle, he sees there is a note there that Alan had written: ""If a woman tries to claim this suitcase, call the police."" This is a further indication that Alan didn't trust Jane. The lonely guy gives the suitcase to Jane and takes off; he's not going to tangle with this dame.Jane goes to Danny's apartment, where she finds Danny quite drunk. She displays the satchel and the money to him. She then asks him to explain what the blackmail money was paid for. Danny explains that he stumbled unto a fraud. A wealthy L.A. insurance agent, who provided insurance on bridges, actually never took out the policies. Instead, because bridges rarely fall apart, the agent simply took the annual payments on the policies and kept the money for personal use. Danny blackmailed the man; the $60,000 was Danny's blackmail payoff. Jane is overjoyed, for she now knows the money is not marked and they can spend it. She suggests that they drink a toast before heading off to Mexico together. But Jane slips some poison (which Danny had bought earlier for Jane to use on Kathy) into his drink, and he dies.Meanwhile, Don has explained to the police his suspicions about what's going on, and they agree to call on Danny. Just ahead of the police's arrival at Danny's place, Jane flees to Mexico. The police discover the dead Danny and conclude he committed suicide. Jane had arranged Danny's hand on the poison bottle before she left the room. The police talk to Danny's girlfriend (June Storey) who's just arriving at Danny's room. The girlfriend explains that she was with Danny when he bought the poison, that she knew Danny had some sort of big deal on but didn't know the details of it. And the police use her testimony to bolster their conclusion about Danny committing suicide. When Don arrives at Danny's room, he tells Lt. Breach he's sure Jane is responsible for Danny's death and Alan's death and that Alan's body is in the lake, but Breach dismisses Don theory as nonsense and refuses to drag the lake because he doesn't have enough evidence to go on to conduct such an expensive and time-consuming operation.We see Jane speeding along a road in Mexico; she stops to transfer the satchel of money from the back seat of her car to the trunk. A stranger in a cowboy hat (George Mann) stops and offers Jane aid. When he notices a large bill on her bumper, he suddenly develops other ideas.

    Synopsis
    The film starts by showing us a man (Robert Neff) sitting in a large car parked off to the side of the road, engine still running, though. We're shown the mile marker (3.5) he's parked at; the man looks at his watch. It is precisely 8:30. He's obviously waiting for someone.Then we see a car approaching up a winding road. It contains Jane and Alan Palmer (Lizabeth Scott and Arthur Kennedy) on their way to a party in the Hollywood Hills, hosted by Alan's boss and his wife. Jane Palmer begs her husband Alan, who is driving the couple's convertible, to turn the car around. When she explains that she cannot face the party's hostess and her condescending ways, Alan turns the car around only after he and Jane argue. In the course of the argument, Jane reached for the ignition keys. Instead, she hit the headlight switch, turning off the headlights, which Alan then turned back on. We see the man in the waiting car drive it unto the highway toward Jane and Alan's convertible.As Jane and Alan's convertible passes the oncoming car, the driver tosses a large satchel into the back seat of their car. The driver had interpreted their blinking headlights as his signal. After stopping briefly to examine the suitcase and discovering that it contains bundles of money, Jane and Alan see another car approaching theirs at a fast speed. Jane urges Alan to get into the car and then, behind the wheel herself, she drives on. A chase ensues, with the car pursuing Jane and Alan until, after a dangerous drive, Jane finally is able to give the pursuer the slip. Obviously, the car pursuing Jane and Alan's vehicle is the one into which the satchel should have been thrown. And it is possible that the driver of that car now has the license plate number of Jane and Alan's car and will be able to trace them.Back in downtown L.A., Jane and Alan are stopped by a police officer who writes Alan a ticket for making a turn without signaling. The police officer notices the two are nervous. Jane tells him she and Alan are eloping to Las Vegas.When Jane and Alan get back to their apartment in Chateau Michele, Alan wants to turn over the money to the police and be done with it. Jane sweet talks him into delaying that.Alan's sister Kathy Palmer (Kristine Miller), who has Apartment 515 across the hall, comes into their apartment, even though it is late. Alan pleads a headache and Kathy leaves, but this scene serves to introduce Kathy, her close relationship to Alan, and her dislike of Jane.After Kathy goes, Jane and Alan agree to check the bag at Union Station for a week. Alan and Jane go to Union Station and check the satchel, for which he receives a claim ticket. To draw viewers' attention to the checkroom claim ticket, Alan at first appears to have lost it, until he reveals that it's fallen through a hole in his overcoat pocket and into the lining of the coat. He retrieves it. Alan later places this ticket in the drawer of a chest of drawers in the bedroom under his service revolver, though Jane doesn't know he's put the ticket there.The next day Jane goes on a shopping spree, purchasing $780.00 worth of clothing, among which is a fur jacket. Alan learns of this when his bank calls to tell him that Jane has written checks for large amounts. When Alan comes home, he and Jane argue again because Alan wants to turn the money over to the police. Alan brings up Jane's first husband, a man named Blanchert, whom she married for his money. Jane tells Alan that growing up she was white-collar poor, that she lived among middle-class people but her family never had enough to keep up. This explains Jane's attitude toward money. To appease Alan, Jane agrees to his plan to duplicate the events of their first date.Earlier that day after Jane returned from shopping and before Alan came home, small time hood Danny Fuller (Dan Duryea), posing as a detective, arrives at the Palmers' apartment (having traced their car's license number) and asks to search the place, even though he doesn't have a warrant. When Jane allows the search, Danny knows she has the money, otherwise, as Danny says, she would have screamed for the police and tried to throw him out. Danny demands that Jane give him the suitcase. Jane lies, telling Danny that they have already turned it over to the police; Danny leaves but threatens to return if news of a suitcase full of money being turned over to the police does not appear in the afternoon's newspapers.To duplicate their first date, Alan and Jane make plans for dinner and a boat ride at a nearby lake the next night. Before Jane and Alan ""date,"" while Alan is out, Danny returns, knowing now that Jane lied, but Jane persuades him to split the money with her. She tells Danny she can take him to the money. She still hasn't revealed to Danny that it's in the satchel at the Union Station checkroom.Of course, Jane has to get the money, and to get that, she must locate the claim ticket. Jane tells Danny to meet her later that night at a palm tree at the west end shore of the lake where she and Alan are going for a boat ride. When Jane goes to meet Alan for dinner, she takes his gun from the dresser drawer because she is planning to kill Alan and dump his body in the lake.After dinner, Alan and Jane take a motorized boat onto the lake. But Jane loses her nerve; she asks Alan to go back to shore, but Alan says no, they've just come out unto the lake. Alan wants a cigarette and is about to open Jane's purse, when she strikes his hand, stopping him. Alan asks her what's in the purse; it's so heavy. And at that point, the gun falls out of the purse. The two grapple for the gun, and it goes off, killing Alan.With Alan's dead body in the boat, Jane then steers the boat toward the palm tree and picks up Danny, who is stunned to discover Alan's corpse in the boat. He's going to back out; he wants no part of murder. But, seeing he hasn't any choice, Danny helps her dump Alan's corpse overboard, after first securing the corpse so it won't rise to the top.Before putting Alan's body into the pond, Jane took off his overcoat and his hat, and Danny put them on. When the boat pulls up to the dock, Danny gets out, keeping his face and body turned away from the boat rental agent (Billy Halop), while Jane pays. He hurries off, and Jane rushes to catch up with him.Together Jane and Danny drive back to Jane's apartment house where Danny drives the car into the basement garage, according to their plan to convince Pete (Smoki Whitfield), the black garage attendant, that Alan is still alive. Once the car is in the garage, Jane gets out, and Danny drives the car out of the garage, but not before Jane calls Pete's attention to herself and ""Alan."" She tells Pete ""Alan"" wants the car washed when he brings it back. As ""Alan"" drives out of the garage, Jane shouts after him, telling him to purchase some cigarettes for her at the drug store. Thus, it appears that ""Alan"" is going on an errand of some sort and will get the cigarettes on the way.Once upstairs, Jane knocks on Kathy's door and asks her to come over for a nightcap. Jane tells Cathy that Alan has gone out to get a bottle and some cigarettes, and Kathy says she will stay for a drink. When Alan doesn't come home after several hours, Jane acts worried and eventually phones the police to report Alan as a missing person. In the course of this time, the nervous Jane asks Kathy to fix them both a drink, whereupon Kathy discovers that there is plenty of liquor under the kitchen sink. So why is Alan going out for a bottle? Further, Jane tells Kathy she's sure that Alan doesn't love her anymore, that he's involved with another woman, which Kathy dismisses as nonsense, though this does arouse her suspicions further. Why is Jane telling her this?After Kathy leaves, Jane leaves to keep an appointment with Danny. She still believes he has the claim check in the lining of Alan's overcoat. At the motel unit where Danny is renting a room, they inspect that lining of the coat and Danny brings out the claim check--only it isn't the claim check. It's a blank piece of paper. Alan, suspecting Jane would try to claim the money behind his back, had replaced the claim check with this blank and put the original claim check in his dresser under his revolver.Jane now comes clean and explains to Danny where the money really is and how they must find the actual claim check ticket in order to get the money. In the motel room, Danny tries to kiss Jane, saying he wants to know Jane better. She momentarily resists him but then embraces him, kisses him, and the scene fades out. I deduce the two have sex. The fade-out used here was common in films of the 40s to indicate a sexual scene. Also, from their very first meeting, Jane had been trying to lure Danny into sex, which, at that time, Danny wasn't interested in.The next morning, still worried about Alan, Kathy uses her passkey to enter Jane and Alan's apartment. She searches through various items of furniture, coming at last to the chest of drawers in the bedroom. There she discovers that Alan's revolver is missing. And underneath the cloth upon which the revolver rest, Kathy discovers the claim check for the satchel, which she takes--steals. Jane, of course, is unaware the claim check was there.The next morning when Kathy asks about Alan and learns he's still missing, Kathy suggests they look for Alan's revolver. It was one of his favorite things. If Alan were planning to run away, surely he'd have taken it. But they find it in the dresser drawer, where Jane put it when she returned home the previous evening.The police cannot act upon Jane's report of Alan as missing. Alan hasn't been gone long enough and, besides, there's no evidence of a crime or foul play. Nonetheless, Jane continues to play the role of distraught spouse, worried over a missing husband.It's apparent that Jane and Kathy don't like each other, and Kathy begins to be suspicious of Jane. She's also aware that Danny (whom she doesn't know by name) has come to Jane's apartment.Just as Kathy leaves Jane's apartment, she opens the door to find a man standing there, about to knock. This man identifies himself as Don Blake (Don DeFore), who says he's Alan's friend and a fellow war veteran. Don says Alan told him to drop by if he were ever in L.A. Don is in L. A. for a vacation and decided to look up Alan. Kathy takes him into her own apartment and explains that Alan has just recently gone missing. She tells Blake of her suspicions about Jane. This makes Kathy and Don Blake a team investigating Alan's disappearance. At the film's denouement, we learn why Don is only too willing to believe the worst of Jane.Later, Kathy introduces Jane to Blake. Jane asks Blake some questions about his war service with Alan and is immediately suspicious when Blake gives her erroneous answers. After Blake and Kathy depart, Danny arrives.Jane tells Danny that she has the money, and they will go to get it. In reality, she is planning to drive Danny into the Hollywood Hills and shoot him to death with Alan's gun. Jane drives recklessly, and Danny becomes increasingly suspicious and unnerved. After Jane narrowly avoids a collision, Danny demands that she stop. He tells her she's lying when she says the money's buried in the hills, and he gets out of the car and walks away. As he disappears, Jane cries to herself, ""The claim ticket is in that coat,"" because she thinks the claim ticket is still in the lining of Alan's coat, which Danny is wearing. She must now get that coat back from Danny. Jane drives to the beach and abandons her car. Two vagrants (Richard Irving and Jimmie Dodd) steal it and drive away in it. They abandon the car near the Mexican border.Jane visits Danny at his place to reclaim the coat. This arouses Danny's suspicions, and he begins to search the coat. In the lining he finds--what?--NOT the claim ticket but a blank bit of paper about the size of the claim check ticket. Alan, again not trusting Jane, had substituted the blank for the real ticket. Jane now comes clean and explains to Danny where the money really is and how they must find the actual claim check ticket in order to get the money. Jane and Danny have sex as her way of luring him on to trust her.When Jane returns to her apartment, a Lt. Breach (Barry Kelley) shows up, saying he's investigating Alan's disappearance. Kathy is also there. Lt. Breach tells Jane, ""There's another woman"" and details the near accident that occurred when Jane was driving Danny into the Hollywood Hills a night earlier. The driver of the car Jane almost hit obtained the license number of her car, thus Breach says it was Alan and Jane's car. Lt. Breach says the other woman (in fact Jane herself) was driving and Alan (Danny dressed in Alan's coat and hat) was the passenger. Instead of acting surprised and stunned at this news, Jane says she knew there was another woman and gives a bit of description of this woman, saying she'd only seen her from a distance. Kathy who's listening to all of this, is confused and suspicious; Alan just couldn't be committing adultery; not her brother!Suspicious of Don and his story of being Alan's war buddy, Jane phoned Jack Sharber (David Clarke), a friend of Alan's with whom she is acquainted. When Sharber tells her that he does not recognize Blake's name as belonging to a member of their war unit, she invites Sharber to the apartment the following night to meet Don Blake.Later, Jane and Danny meet again. Jane explains that Kathy has become too suspicious of her and feels that Kathy will discover their plot. Jane asks Danny to buy her some poison so that she can kill Kathy, making it appear a suicide, i.e., Kathy and Alan were close; Kathy was despondent over Alan's disappearance; therefore, Kathy commits suicide. Danny agrees to do this, though he doesn't like it but says he's too far in to back out now.Knowing Jane is out of her apartment, Kathy, using a key she has to Alan and Jane's apartment, enters the apartment. She begins a search of the apartment and discovers that Alan's revolver is missing. She also notices the claim check ticket, which was under the cloth in the drawer where the gun had been kept. Jane is obviously unaware of this or she wouldn't be searching for the ticket in the coat lining. Without a qualm, Kathy takes the ticket! This was stupid thing to do. Certainly, had Jane known of the ticket, she would immediately notice the missing ticket and deduce that Kathy has been in the apartment.Later, Blake arrives to pick up Kathy for a date, and she gives him the claim check ticket. They agree to stop at Union Station before going to dinner and present the claim check ticket to see what is there. But as they leave Kathy's apartment, Jane demands that they come over to her apartment, where Sharber is waiting. When Sharber says that he does not recognize Blake, Blake realizes that his phony story of being Alan's war buddy is unfolding as a lie. When Sarber goes, Jane, in a take-no-prisoners situation, pulls her gun and demands that Don give her the claim ticket. Kathy, now suspicious of Blake herself, because he lied about being Alan's buddy, runs into her apartment to phone the police, hoping they will arrive to straighten everything out. When Kathy returns to Jane's apartment, she finds Don unconscious on the floor and Jane gone. Kathy once again phones the police and tells them to go to Union Station. Now that she has the claim check ticket, Jane has gone to collect the satchel herself.At Union Station, Jane decides not to collect the suitcase herself. Instead, she gives a come-on to a lonely guy (Denver Pyle) near the newsstand and asks him to reclaim the bag for her in return for $5. She also promises him that, if he wishes, he can later spend that $5 on her. Thinking he's unto a potential one-night stand, the guy gets the suitcase. But when he reads the tag on the satchel's handle, he sees there is a note there that Alan had written: ""If a woman tries to claim this suitcase, call the police."" This is a further indication that Alan didn't trust Jane. The lonely guy gives the suitcase to Jane and takes off; he's not going to tangle with this dame.Jane goes to Danny's apartment, where she finds Danny quite drunk. She displays the satchel and the money to him. She then asks him to explain what the blackmail money was paid for. Danny explains that he stumbled unto a fraud. A wealthy L.A. insurance agent, who provided insurance on bridges, actually never took out the policies. Instead, because bridges rarely fall apart, the agent simply took the annual payments on the policies and kept the money for personal use. Danny blackmailed the man; the $60,000 was Danny's blackmail payoff. Jane is overjoyed, for she now knows the money is not marked and they can spend it. She suggests that they drink a toast before heading off to Mexico together. But Jane slips some poison (which Danny had bought earlier for Jane to use on Kathy) into his drink, and he dies.Meanwhile, Don has explained to the police his suspicions about what's going on, and they agree to call on Danny. Just ahead of the police's arrival at Danny's place, Jane flees to Mexico. The police discover the dead Danny and conclude he committed suicide. Jane had arranged Danny's hand on the poison bottle before she left the room. The police talk to Danny's girlfriend (June Storey) who's just arriving at Danny's room. The girlfriend explains that she was with Danny when he bought the poison, that she knew Danny had some sort of big deal on but didn't know the details of it. And the police use her testimony to bolster their conclusion about Danny committing suicide. When Don arrives at Danny's room, he tells Lt. Breach he's sure Jane is responsible for Danny's death and Alan's death and that Alan's body is in the lake, but Breach dismisses Don theory as nonsense and refuses to drag the lake because he doesn't have enough evidence to go on to conduct such an expensive and time-consuming operation.We see Jane speeding along a road in Mexico; she stops to transfer the satchel of money from the back seat of her car to the trunk. A stranger in a cowboy hat (George Mann) stops and offers Jane aid. When he notices a large bill on her bumper, he suddenly develops other ideas. But before the guy can do anything to Jane, a police car drives up, and the officer (Alex Montoya) asks her if anything is wrong. Jane calmly says, ""No. I just finished changing a flat tire."" She drives off.Once in Mexico City, Jane checks into a lavish hotel and hides the suitcase containing the $60,000 in her room. She buys herself some fancy clothes, joins the hotel's social whirl, and is soon being escorted by Carlos (John Mansfield), a smitten Latin lover. Thinking all is going her way, she is upset to discover Don Blake knocking at her hotel room door. When he barges in, Blake accuses her of murdering Alan and of being in Mexico with the money. He leads her to believe that Alan's body has been found in the lake. Don cons Jane into showing him the suitcase of money by saying he'll let her alone if she gives him half the money.Once he's seen the suitcase, he reveals that he is actually the brother of Jane's first husband, Blanchet, and says that he never believed the report he'd received when he was in the Army that his brother had committed suicide, but rather, he had always suspected Jane of murdering him. But then he reverses himself and says that perhaps his brother did commit suicide but only because of the heartless way Jane treated him. Blake calls the police, waiting in the hotel lobby, whom he'd already alerted to what he was doing. Overwhelmed by panic and dismay, Jane backs away from Blake. As the police come into her hotel suite, Jane bumps into the balcony railing outside her suite's living room doors and falls from the balcony to her death below.In the lobby, we see Blake and Kathy together. They had married a few days earlier, and Blake tells her they will go home, that their honeymoon has been a short one.

                    1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France. Against the will of its elderly male and his adult niece residents, the Nazis commandeer a house for one of their officers, Lt. Werner von Ebrennac, to live in for as long as he is in the area on Nazi business. As a figurative and literal silent protest against the Nazis and the officer, the uncle and niece do whatever is required of them while the officer is in their house, however they do not acknowledge his presence, living largely in silence whenever he is around. The officer treats the housing situation with care, like he is a guest. Although not a nightly occurrence, the officer begins an evening routine with his reluctant hosts: in his civilian clothes, he knocks on the door of the room in which they have convened for the evening, walking in shortly thereafter knowing that no acknowledgment will be made for him to enter, he visits with them for no more than five minutes before he bids them a good evening as he exits. During these visits, he speaks reverently about, among other things, culture - music and literature in particular as he is a composer and musician - his national pride, his love of France, and what he hopes will emerge from the war, namely a strong and free France, stronger than it was before the war, and the marriage between the French and German cultures which will enrich the lives of all Europeans. All the while, he makes no expectations from them, either to listen, or to answer if they are indeed listening. At the end of what ends up being his six month stay at the house, he does end up having a profound effect on the uncle and niece, despite that effect being largely unacknowledged, as his stay in France has a profound effect on him, opening up his eyes to the reality of the war based largely on his first ever visit into Paris.

                    At the age of 9, Tommy Woodry has a reputation for telling tall tales -- the latest one being that his family is moving from Manhattan to a ranch out west. When the landlord interrupts the Woodrys at dinner to show their about to be vacated apartment, the Woodrys tell Tommy enough is enough. Then that hot summer night Tommy decides to sleep on the fire escape -- outside the Kellerson's apartment, since it is a story higher and gets more breeze. Tommy sees the Kellersons kill a man. Tommy's parents and the police won't believe his story. But the Kellersons want to silence him.

                    The Woodrys live in a New York City tenement. Nine year old Tommy Woodry has a penchant for telling what he considers are harmless stories of fancy. Most of the people to who he tells the stories know they are such, but the belief in a few of those stories has led to potential problems. As such, his parents, Ed and Mary Woodry, want him to stop telling lies or else be punished. One evening during a heat wave, Tommy witnesses their upstairs neighbors, Joe and Jean Kellerson, kill a man through their window while sleeping on the fire escape outside. He also overhears them stating that the killing was premeditated. Tommy not only tells his parents but also the police. His exasperated parents believe Tommy is once again crying wolf, but the two people who know that Tommy is telling the truth are the Kellersons, to who the story gets back. Tommy thus fears for his safety, especially one evening when his parents are not around and he is physically confined to their apartment. Tommy will do anything to protect himself from the Kellersons or to get someone in authority truly to believe the Kellersons are the murderers he says they are, that is if he can escape from his confinement.

He climbs up outside a neighbor's window, the Kellersons, where he sees them kill a man with a pair of scissors. The problem is that Tommy has a reputation for telling tall tales and so no one believes him now that he's telling the truth. He even sneaks out of the house and goes down to the police station but they don't take him seriously. Tommy is afraid that if the Kellersons find out what he saw, he will be their next victim. The Kellersons do find out - when Tommy's mother makes him apologize - and they have every intention to kill him.

                    The movie is about Chicago White Sox pitcher Monty Stratton (Jimmy Stewart), who in the 1930s, compiled a 37-19 won-loss record in three seasons. After he became the winningest right-hander in the American League, his major league career ended prematurely when a hunting accident in 1938 forced doctors to amputate his right leg. With a wooden leg and his wife Ethel's (June Allyson) help, Stratton made a successful minor league comeback in 1946, continuing to pitch in minor leagues throughout the rest of the 1940s and into the 1950s.

Joe, who is in love with Eve, suggests they put on an underwater spectacle in honor of a visiting South American polo team captained by José O'Rourke. When the inexperienced Betty goes to the polo field looking for a visiting polo player with whom to fall in love, she meets who she believes is José. Who she actually has met is Jack Spratt, the equally as inexperienced local masseur for the polo teams. Jack does not correct Betty's misconception as he believes she would never date a regular fella like him. Wanting to protect her inexperienced sister from an experienced South American athlete, Eve forbids the actual José from dating Betty. José, having never met Betty, agrees only on the condition that Eve go out with him instead. For José, it's love at first sight with Eve. Things get complicated when Betty and Jack (pretending to be José) get serious, and Eve and José get serious, with Joe wanting to get José out of the way, and Eve not wanting to feel anything for José if only to protect Eve from getting hurt. A local mobster who thinks he can make some easy money if José doesn't show up for the scheduled polo match adds further complications to the proceedings.

At the theater, Lefty and the Zoto brothers spy through a window as Maggie puts on the diamond necklace, but Mike asks her not to wear it, promising to buy her an engagement ring instead.

    Synopsis
    
With her husband away on business Lucia Harper (Joan Bennett) has her hands full at home with her teenaged daughter Bea (Geraldine Brooks) who has been keeping company with an older man Ted Darby (Shepperd Strudwick) whom Lucia distrusts. Darby claims ties to the Art world and that his interest in Bea is for her artist abilities, then one night after a meeting in which Bea realizes that Darby wants to use her for his own pleasure, she hits him and leaves. The next morning Lucia discovers Darbys dead body and believes that daughter Bea will be blamed so she dumps the body in the lagoon far from their house. Knowing that the police will have a difficult time tying Darby to Bea, Lucia relaxes until charming gangster Martin Donnelly (James Mason) arrives to tell her that his boss, a burley opportunist named Nagle (Roy Roberts) has love letters that Bea had sent to Darby clearly implicating her affection for the older man and surely enough evidence to insure that the girl would be arrested and tried for murder. Lucia argues with Donnelly as he has sensitivity that seems un-gangster-like, and she agrees to give him money but must sell what she owns since she doesnt have all the money available in her bank account. As Lucia and Donnelly move from bank to pawn shop to grocery store for the family, the blackmailer develops sympathy for the mother and house wife, and decides to abandon the blackmailing crime. When Nagle discovers that Donnelly is backing down from Lucia he goes to demand the money himself engaging in a battle with his minion.

"67","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041767/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis","In Rome, in the year 1500 a funeral is taking place in an ornate church. In the first pew, two noble women in mourning are gossiping, and the man next to them orders one of them to show proper respect for her dead husband. The man soon leaves the church and signals others to join him.In a large chamber, the man, Cesare Borgia (Orson Welles) tells others that his goal is to unify central Italy under his control. By military means perhaps, but if a suitable marriage is arranged it will happen more quickly. He wants to marry his just widowed sister Lucrezia to Alfonso d'Este, heir to the duke of Ferrara, and he needs the right ambassador. The old duke's death might happen soon after.The man he needs for the mission must be ""as quick at deceit as a fox. He must have the grace of a dancer, the wrist of an assassin. He must have little regard for good faith, yet by his astuteness be able to confuse men's minds . . . He must charm as a snake charms birds, yet he must make no friends, except for those who may be of use to him, and for the same reason although he may make use of love, he must not love.""Cesare looks around the room, carefully, slowly, then tells everyone to leave except Andrea Orsini (Tyrone Power), young, smart, charming, deadly with a blade, opportunistic, much as his master. Andrea has been courting, with Cesare's acquiescence, Angela Borgia (Marina Berti), cousin to Cesare.The mission is to start at once, which much displeases Angela, but Andrea soothes her feelings, assuring her that his mission will be over quickly. Since he is himself a skillful painter, his first step is to paint a portrait of Lucrezia to take with him to the proposed groom. He needs money, so he offers another of his canvases for sale to an agent. While haggling with the agent, 25 ducats, not less than 75, maybe 30, etc., a handsome young woman observes him and the painting, and offers 100 ducats. She is Camilla Verano (Wanda Hendrix), wife of the Count of Città del Monte, and Andrea gallantly gives her the painting, refusing payment. The script is studded with gallant, clever, cynical observations about love, diplomacy and war, as in this scene.Shortly before departure, as Andrea walks back to the palace with Angela, a hired assassin first stalks the couple, then moves in to stab Andrea with his dagger. However, Andrea has spotted him, his lunge fails, and Andrea overpowers his attacker, Mario Belli (Everett Sloane). Orsini makes Belli an offer he can't refuse, his life for information and a switch of allegiance. Since an assassin who reveals who hired him would be marked for death anyway, Belli agrees to serve Orsini, solemnly promising to give warning before switching allegiances again. He had been hired by the Duke of Ferrara, who hated Cesare with a passion that extended to any of Cesare's ambassadors or even servants.Mario Belli joins Andrea Orsini in travel back towards Ferrara, riding on a canal barge. They stop at an inn and Andrea sneaks out and heads for the home of a blacksmith's widow. Belli follows, unseen.The blacksmith's widow is Mona Zoppo (Katina Paxinou), and we learn she is Andrea's mother. He is a commoner, an impostor, not a member of an obscure side branch of the family of the powerful Orsini family of Florence, as he publicly claims. Mona is happy to see her son well, yet is horrified when she learns he is an impostor and deceiver. She prays to a painting of the Madonna that Andrea did when he was young, that he might leave his sinful ways and live with honor, even with little money, or if not, that he be punished. The altercation with his mother is witnessed by Belli, who has followed Andrea surreptitiously.Andrea and Mario go on to Ferrara, and seek out Alfonso dEste, the intended husband for Lucrezia, who is a genius at military engineering. With a lot of flattery and deceit and promises of a doubling of the usual dowry, they get Alfonso to sign a marriage contract, despite the old Duke's angry threats.Returning to Rome, Andrea's next assignment is as ambassador to Città del Monte, with orders to find a way to remove the elderly count or to help Borgia conquer the city. Angela is not happy about this because she is wary of the young countess, but once again, Angela's wishes give way to affairs of state. At Città del Monte, Andrea soon ingratiates himself with Camilla and her husband, seventy year-old Count Verano (Felix Aylmer), ruler of the fortified town.With Belli, Orsini cases the defenses of the city, which is truly perched on a mountain. They learn that the old man loves gardening and roses, and that when he has a problem to solve, he goes to meditate at a high terrace overlooking a valley, next to a precipice. Belli is delighted because it will be easy to push him from the terrace into the precipice.Andrea observes, both puzzled and fascinated, how the Count rules with wisdom, humanity, patience and honor, in contrast to the style of Cesare. The Count warns him that he is aware of Andrea's likely treachery, yet treats him as though no malice were suspected. As time passes, Andrea begins to admire the Count, and as he knows Cesare Borgia will soon arrive with an army to demand the capitulation of Città del Monte, he discovers that most uncomfortable of feelings . . . a conscience. The fatherless Orsini is increasingly impressed by the Count's nobility, and love for his people, and he also becomes increasingly enamored with Camilla.Orsini takes up painting as a pastime, in a canvas he uses Belli in a ""last supper"" scene as a model for Judas. Camilla, at first wary of Orsini, grows to admire his artistic talent, which proves to her he has a noble soul behind the warrior and crafty ambassador role. Camilla asks Andrea to paint her portrait, and the Count agrees. With their increased time together, his feelings deepen, and threaten to turn him against his deadly master, whom no one betrays twice. The young woman appears to reciprocate his feelings, but there is no hint that she won't remain a faithful wife.Meantime, Cesare presses for actions that would put Città del Monte under his control. Borgia demands that Verano allow free passage of troops through the territory, and the contribution of additional troops to his service. Verano says he will have an answer the next day, and goes to his high terrace to reflect and pray. Belli recognizes the moment to act has come, tells Orsini he is on his way to the terrace.Orsini suffers a change of heart when asked to betray the noble count and his beautiful young wife, runs after Belli and aborts the planned assassination. Belli announces that he quits his service to Orsini and returns to Borgia.The aging ruler puts the question to his subjects, who urge him to resist the tyrant. Orsini then renounces his service to the Borgias and pledges himself to the cause of defending Città del Monte against them, and quickly organizes the defense and preparations for a long siege. Count Verano is sincerely grateful for Orsini's technical war knowledge and energy. The night before a battle is expected, Verano reveals to Orsini that he now believes he is brave and of noble heart and would be worthy of Camilla in the right circumstances.As Cesare's army passes through the Verano territories, the Count launches an attack on the invading troops as they cross some misty woods. A rousing battle takes place, the cavalry of the invaders retreats in disorder, not without cost, as Verano is mortally wounded. On his deathbed, Verano publicly says he would approve a marriage between Orsini and Camilla.Cesare's armies return, and there is a full-blown castle siege. Fat, stubby cannons blast away from the crenelles, great wooden trebuchets hurl stones and flaming balls of pitch into the city, vats of boiling oil are tipped over onto Borgia's soldiers as they try to scale the city's walls. The city holds well, but after three months the city is exhausted.Borgia sends ambassadors, offering to spare and protect the city and its inhabitants provided Camilla accepts a Borgia appointed prime minister and provided the traitor Orsini is surrendered. Camilla rejects the terms, saying she prefers battle, and the ambassadors return to Cesare. However, Orsini knows the battle would be lost, and he willingly gives himself up to Borgia's troops demanding only that the terms of the offer be put in writing.At a triumphal dinner, Borgia wants to expose ""Orsini"" to Camilla as a commoner and brings Andrea's mother in. The bound and tortured Orsini is brought in front of the main dining table, and the mother and son react in a way that clearly reveal the truth.Cesare orders Andrea's execution, but Belli convincingly proposes a much more cruel punishment for the traitor, to put out his eyes and leave him a blind beggar forever. Cesare likes and adopts the idea, and Belli says that for the amusement of those present, he can make the sentence effective on the spot, with his two thumbs.Belli screams and yells in glee when he is given the go ahead, but what he actually does is get Orsini to scream bloody murder while he pretends to gouge his eyes out, leaving him dripping with blood and exhibiting two large blood covered grapes as the gouged out eyes. This is too disgusting even to Cesare, so he orders his mother to lead him out and away.Orsini is recovering at his mother's house when Belli shows up to visit. When asked why he betrayed Cesare and saved Orsini, as there appeared to be no payoff, he answers that he did it for professional pride as a doublecrosser. ""I discovered that the devil doesn't always pay best. This whole thing pleases me. Who betrayed who and where did it start? No matter. It shall be said among my fellow practitioners in double-dealing that I was the greatest of them all.""They proceed to plan a rescue of Camilla from a dungeon and the expulsion from the city of Cesare's soldiers. Citizens of Città del Monte gladly cooperate in the conspiracy. At the last minute, when Orsini has just killed one dungeon guard, knocked out another, things go awry, a church bell signal is given too early, but no matter, the conspiracy succeeds after a canonical sword fighting duel between Don Esteban (Leslie Bradley), the garrison leader, and Andrea, while Camilla watches on.All's well that ends well and the commoner marries the countess.","

Over the next few months as the fatherless Orsini becomes more and more impressed by the Count's honor, nobility, and wisdom, he also becomes increasingly enamored with Camilla, Verano's twenty year-old wife. Although she reciprocates his feelings, the younger woman remains faithful to her husband, and and doesn't consummate them. When Borgia demands Varano cede troops to his service, the aging ruler puts the question to his subjects, who urge him to resist the tyrant. Orsini has a change of heart and aborts Belli's planned assassination of the old count. Orsini then renounces his service to the Borgias and pledges himself to the cause of defending Citta del Monte against them.

                    On the day of his retirement, Rear Admiral Jonathan L. Scott reflects on his role in introducing aircraft carriers to the U.S. Navy. After World War I, there was a general downsizing of the military. There were only limited opportunities to create a carrier-bound air capability. The aircraft were not designed specifically for landing on a flat top and several death occur during training. Over the years however, Scott is one of several men who pursue their dream of aircraft carriers and aircraft specifically designed for that purpose. Their worth is proved in World War II at the Battle of Midway and throughout the war.

                    Novelist Alexander Dumas tells his writer-son of Joseph Balsamo, a gypsy boy in southern France who was embittered because his parents were wrongfully hanged and he himself was tortured by the order of Viscount de Montagne. Years later, the man, a carnival charlatan, attracts the attention of Dr. Mesmer, a pioneer in the study of hypnotism. Balsamo rejects Mesmer's plea that he use his power for healing and, instead, decides to use it to seek wealth and fame. He changes his name to Count Cagliostro, and achieves fame throughout Europe by mixing hypnotism with mysticism and showmanship. He is called to cure a girl, Lorenza, held by De Montagne, because she resembles Marie Antoinette, wife of the heir to the throne of France. Cagliostro decides to join De Montagne and Madame du Barry in a plot to seize the power by discrediting the future Queen. Cagliostro achieves his revenge on De Montagne by persuading him to hang himself. He makes Lorenza marry him but can never make her love him. Her love is for Gilbert de Rezel, the captain of Marie Antoinette's guard. In a dramatic court scene, Cagliostro's power of hypnotism is turned against him by Dr. Mesmer and he is seen as a madman. His faithful gypsy friends, Gitano and Zoraida, try to help him escape but he is killed by de Rezel in a roof-top duel.

Hofer is happy as he likes Gary's singing - as popular music goes - and his products are selling. Gary was just an up and comer when he got this gig with the help of his talent agency and his agent Doug Blake. But when his contract comes up for renewal, Gary, who believes his star power can get him bigger and better singing gigs, decides not to re-sign. Doug, hurt by Gary's move since he knows Gary would be nothing without him or the agency, decides to find a new, fresh and exciting replacement singer to outshine Gary. Traveling to New York from Hollywood on this quest, Doug thinks he's found the voice when he meets single mother and aspiring singer Martha Gibson. When Doug brings Martha to Hollywood to audition for Hofer, Hofer rejects her as the replacement, he not liking her upbeat and cutesy style of music. Doug knows that Martha is talented, and with the help of the agency's trusty assistant Vivian Martin, Doug does whatever he can to sell Martha as the next big singing sensation. One person who does take an interest in Martha is Gary, his interest being primarily in her romantically and only if she severs her ties with Doug. Through the ups and downs of trying to make a career from her singing, Martha has to decide if her allegiances and true feelings lie with Doug or Gary, especially as Doug too admits that he is falling in love with her. A move by Doug and a subsequent move by Gary show her what her answer is.

                    Jane and Duke (alias Capt. Blake) accidently meet in Vera Cruz while chasing flim-flam man Fiske. Soon the local Inspector General (El Gato) is involved. Fiske races across Mexico, pursued by Jane and Duke, trailed by the real Capt. Blake. The crafty Inspector General is waiting for them in Tihuacan but they all give him the slip, just in time for the climactic finale. Very tight script and pacing.

                    Duke Halliday and Joan Graham are on the same boat traveling to Veracruz, Mexico. They are unaware that after their antagonistic initial meeting on the Veracruz dock that they are in Mexico to track down the same person, Jim Fiske. Joan's fiancé, Jim absconded with $2,000 of her money, although he always said it was a loan despite he seemingly trying to ditch her at every turn. Duke is a lieutenant and payroll officer with the US Army. Jim robbed Duke of the latest payroll to the tune of $300,000. On the road in Mexico, Jim is able to get a head start on Duke and Joan, who form an unlikely and uneasy alliance to get their money back. Although they have a good idea that Jim is heading to Tehuacán, they have no idea where the $300,000 is, what he intends to do with it once there, or if they have to fight others who may also want that money from him. Meanwhile, Captain Vincent Blake is Duke's commanding officer, who didn't believe Duke's story of being robbed. As such, Vince is tracking Duke, Vince who will shoot Duke to kill if need be. And although they played dumb in their initial questioning when Duke, Joan and Vince arrived in Veracruz, the Veracruz police, led by Inspector General Ortega, are on all their tails trying to find out the big picture of what is going on with this group and Jim's ultimate contact.

Buckley claims to have a map and knows how to decipher the geologic aberrations and cryptic signs written on a large rock, all essential elements in locating the treasure trove. Unfortunately for them both, Buckley gives Storm the slip but meets the same fate that has befallen others who have gotten too close to the treasure... he is found shot to death by a phantom gunman. After being shot at by the mysterious killer himself, Storm stumbles across the rifle of German immigrant Jacob Walz, the dour ""Dutchman"" of legend, who committed multiple murders in the 1880s to become the only living soul to know the location of the treasure. In flashback, Walz brags to the townsfolk that the gold he spends so freely comes from the fabulous Peralta Mine but stubbornly refuses to disclose its location and teases them with riddles that offer enigmatic clues to its location. Walz becomes increasingly paranoid about his secret, especially when he finds out the the grasping woman he loves is already married and scheming to find his gold.

                    Diabolical Dr. Vulcan causes the deaths of Professors Drake (Dale Van Sickel) and Millard (James Craven)of Science Associates, a privately-operated desert research project. The 'accidents' attract the attention of Glenda Thomas (Mae Clarke), photographer for Miracle Science Magazine. She visits the project and is placated by Burt Winslow('House Peters Jr'), publicity director, and Jeff King (Tristram Coffin'), a project member. Later, Jeff is attacked by two of Vulcan's henchmen and he routs them. Jeff visits a remote cave where he has been hiding Professor Millard, whose life was miraculously saved. Millard shows him a rocket-powered flying suit which he and Jeff have perfected. When needed, Jeff dons the suit and, as the mysterious Rocket Man, thwarts endless sinister plans of Dr. Vulcan to get control of Science Associates' devices which, if controlled by the wrong party, could easily wreak world disaster. Vulcan, a member of Science Assocaites, using an alias, gets possession of a powerful Decimator, capable of disintegrating rock strata, and plans to use it to destroy New York City if the mayor refuses to meet his billion dollar ransom demand.
