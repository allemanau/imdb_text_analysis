                    Clopin bought Esmeralda from the gypsies when she was young. Dancing in the square at the festival, Esmeralda is spotted by Jehan, the evil brother of the good archdeacon Claude Frollo. When he sets Quasimodo out to kidnap Esmeralda, Phoebus, Captain of the Guards, rescues her and captures Quasimodo. The courts sentence Quasimodo to be flogged, and the only one who will give him water while he is tied in the square is Esmeralda. After Clopin forces Esmeralda to leave Phoebus at the ball, she sends a note to Phoebus to meet her at Notre-Dame. In the garden, Phoebus is stabbed in the back by Jehan. Esmeralda is accused of stabbing Phoebus, convicted by the courts and sentenced to hang. When Esmeralda again rejects Jehan, he tells her that Phoebus is dead, even though it is not true. Clopin, Phoebus and Quasimodo all try different ways to save Esmeralda.

Harold promises to Mildred to get married with her as soon as he ""make good"". Harold shares a room with his friend ""Limpy"" Bill and he finally gets a job as salesman in the De Vore Department Store. However, he pawns Bill's phonograph, buys a lavaliere and writes to Mildred telling that he is a manager of De Vore. One day, Harold sees an old friend from Great Bend that is a policeman and when he meets his friend Bill, he asks Bill to push the policeman over him and make him fall down. However Bill pushes the wrong policeman that chases him, but he escapes climbing up a building. Out of the blue, Mildred is convinced by her mother to visit Harold without previous notice and he pretends to be the manager of De Vore. When Harold overhears the general manager telling that he would give one thousand dollars to to anyone that could promote De Vore attracting people to the department store, he offers five hundred dollars to Bill to climb up the Bolton Building. However things go wrong when the angry policeman decides to check whether the mystery man that will climb up the building is the one who pushed him over on the floor.

                    A young man named Harold leaves his small home town of Great Bend to head to the big city so that he can earn enough money to marry his sweetheart, Mildred. He finds that life in the big city is more difficult than he imagined, he only managing to get a low paying sales clerk job at De Vore's Department Store. He even has to share a room with his pal Bill to make ends meet. In the meantime, he writes letters home to Mildred, telling her that he has a great job, and to be patient as he will soon be able to send for her, which is the farthest thing from the truth. He even sends her gifts which he can ill afford. Harold gets into one misadventure after another as he works on not getting fired. His life gets more complicated as Mildred makes a surprise visit into the city, which makes his task of masquerading as a high powered businessman even more difficult, while still trying to do his job under the watchful and critical eye of the department store's head floorwalker, Mr. Stubbs. Harold thinks all his prayers are answered when, after overhearing a conversation with De Vore's General Manager, he comes up with a scheme to make enough money to get married using Bill's special skills. But Harold may have to use those skills himself in order to carry out that scheme.

Upon Harold and his entourage's arrival on Paradiso, Blake immediately believes they are representatives of the bank. Harold is blissfully unaware of things happening around him as he is separated from his nurse and Pipps, and as he tries to make his way to the hotel. But in helping a giant named Colosso, who is an enemy of the revolution, Harold further places himself in a precarious position, while all he wants to do is get some rest all in the name of his health.

He is suspected of the crime, but somebody else confesses to the murder. Meanwhile, he has fallen in love with Sonja, the street-walking daughter of an ex-official who was fired because of drinking.

When Raskolnikow tells him his opinion of his behaviour against the poor, he tries to show he's a good guy also to the public and showing that Sonja is also a thief at the same time by framing her of a theft of 100 Rubels.

                    During the reign of Louis XVI, France, in disarray, becomes under the rule of an all powerful nobility, who rule the state under force. André-Louis Moreau, a Paris law student, has returned to his provincial hometown of Gavrillac, where he hopes to reconnect with his best friend, Philippe de Vilmorin, who is planning on entering the priesthood, and Aline de Kercadiou, the niece of his godfather Quintin de Kercadiou, she who André has always loved. The Marquis de la Tour d'Azyr, a nobleman and expert swordsman who owns much land in the region, kills Philippe in a duel, Philippe who believed the noble class used their power to inflict hardship on the masses. Philippe had no chance in the duel as not ever being a swordsman. André, to avenge Philippe's death in what he believes to be a cowardly act by the Marquis, decides to take up Philippe's gospel of freedom, much of it against the Marquis specifically. André's intentions are against the advice of his godfather, who wants to see a union between the Marquis and Aline so that she will gain that noble title, Aline who too may be so inclined despite her feelings for André. In rallying the masses and in his accusations against the Marquis, André becomes an enemy of the state, and thus goes into hiding, most specifically joining a second rate theater troupe, they who have no idea of who he is. However, with André's input, the troupe becomes well-respected, its most popular show being Scaramouche, the title clown portrayed by a masked André. Despite enjoying a new comfortable life with the troupe, including having a place in heart for Climène Binet, the troupe leader's daughter, André, based partly on circumstances of the country, never has either Aline or the Marquis far from his mind or heart, the latter from who he still seeks revenge, if not for the Philippe, then for the good of the general populace of France.

                    In and around a bell maker near Marburg (today Slovenia) people tell the story of a treasure that was hidden during the Turki invasion of 1683, the year the Turkish Army was besieging Vienna. Everybody think it's nonsense except for an old worker there, who feels that the treasure must be in the bell maker's house. A young traveling worker who has fallen in love with the bell maker's daughter Beate makes fun of this, but she convinces him that the old worker is not that nuts. So he starts searching for himself, and soon he finds it, as well as the old worker. He tells his master, who decides, that the young one has to disappear. He and Beate are leaving, while the old worker offers his part of the treasure to the master if he allows him to marry Beate. Beate, after coming home, hears of that and leaves together with the young worker.

                    Cyrano de Begerac is joyous, witty, a poet, a leader and filled with plenty of charisma and bravado in 17th Century France. He has only one flaw: an unusually long nose which makes him unattractive to any woman. Thus, he cannot have the woman he loves, his cousin Roxanne. Roxanne loves an officer in his army who gets tongue-tied in front of women. Who will Roxanne love? Will Cyrano ever find love? Or will he find happiness in helping the officer woo Roxanne? This is a story of split personalities, human frailty and unrequited love.

                    A woman, named simply ""Elle"" and her husband, a wealthy industrialist, are not on the best of terms. While she enjoys the way he caters to her every whim, she wonders whether he really loves her. He, on the other hand, torments himself by imagining rivals. One morning she awakens from a nightmare in which she has been pursued by a man in various guises, who turns out to be the famous Detective Z, whose memoirs she has been reading. When she and her husband quarrel over leaving Paris permanently for a country estate, he goes to the ""Trouve Tout"" Agency and hires, of all people, Detective Z, to win back her affection. She promptly steals their marriage contract. Z tracks down the document and is nearly seduced in the process, but he resists her and returns to the comforts of home, his adoring mother, and a pet bulldog. In a chic restaurant one evening, she challenges him to a dancing duel, which he wins. After her confession of love, he goes home with a toothache. The contract is returned, the married couple plan to go away on a trip - all is ending as it should...

                    Mysterious, sinister Wilse Dilling receives a coded message to go to the home of Queen Ann, a powerful crime boss. When Wilse meets with her, she sends him to the town of Fallbrook, where he is to await her instructions. Being practically wheelchair-bound has not stopped Dilling from committing a lengthy series of crimes, but to his surprise, he finds that the small town atmosphere makes him feel differently about everything. He finds a good friend in banker's daughter Gertrude Hadley, who helps him believe that he can make a fresh start. But Wilse's new-found contentment is soon shattered by a series of new developments.

In the confusion, Mrs. Stanlaw is separated from her young daughter, who ends up in the care of 'Horseshoe' Riley and Bob Dexter. Mrs. Stanlaw is told by gambler Richard Steele that her daughter is lost. Flash forward 10 years; Riley and Dexter are running a prosperous gold mine, and Steele has just come to town to run the local saloon. Ruth, meanwhile, has grown into a beautiful young woman, and finds herself falling in love with Dexter. Between Steele sending his henchman Pierre to kill Dexter, Dexter discovering that Steele tried to kill him on the ship, and the reunion of Mrs. Stanlaw and Ruth, there's plenty of drama even without the dramatic Alaskan scenery, including the majestic glaciers.

Due to this behaviour his father bans him from his family. Baruch, who joined a small burlesque troupe is discovered by an Austrian Erzherzogin (archdutchess) who introduces him to the director of the most important Theater in Vienna, the Burgtheater. Baruch receives a contract there and becomes more and more an assimilated jew. But his relation with the Erzherzogin isn't approved by the Austrian court, so they have to end it. When an old friend of his father, who is always traveling from one Jewish community to the next (and has told him first about the theatres in the world), Baruch becomes a little bit homesick and returns for a holiday to his old shtetl to see his folks and to pick up his childhood sweetheart. But his father wants him not to enter his house, so he returns to Vienna, with his bride. But his old friend does not stop trying to convince his father of his errors.
